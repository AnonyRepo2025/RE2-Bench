You are given a Python code snippet (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this piece of code, I want you to take the provided inputs (between [INPUT] and [\INPUT]) and predict the output of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. You need to predict output variable values, and print output between [OUTPUT] and [\OUTPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing output. Do not change anything else. ONLY print the output, DO NOT print any reasoning process.

[PYTHON]
import re
import string

text = input()
text = text.lower().strip()
text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
if remove_punctuation:
    text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
print(text)
[/PYTHON]

What will be the output of the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "inputs": "Hello World,  This is   a Test..."
}
```
[/INPUT]

[STRUCTURE]
```
{ 
    "output": XXX
}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

[OUTPUT]
```
{ 
    "output": "hello world this is a test"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
