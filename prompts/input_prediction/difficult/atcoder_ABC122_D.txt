You are given a Python code snippet (between [PYTHON] and [/PYTHON]). For this piece of code, I want you to take the provided output (between [OUTPUT] and [\OUTPUT]) and predict the input of the function. Both input and output are presented in a JSON format. The input structure is defined between [STRUCTURE] and [\STRUCTURE]. You only need to predict input variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure, and print input between [INPUT] and [\INPUT]. You should maintain the structure when printing inputs. Do not change anything else. For prediction, simulate the execution of the program step by step and print your reasoning process before arriving at an answer between [THOUGHT] and [/THOUGHT]. 
[EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
from inspect import cleandoc
import re
from email.parser import HeaderParser
from email.errors import HeaderParseError

docstring = input()
if not docstring:
    print(' \t ')
docstring = cleandoc(docstring)
parts = re.split(r'\n{2,}', docstring)
title = parts[0]
if len(parts) == 1:
    body = ''
    metadata = {}
else:
    parser = HeaderParser()
    try:
        metadata = parser.parsestr(parts[-1])
    except HeaderParseError:
        metadata = {}
        body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:])
    else:
        metadata = dict(metadata.items())
        if metadata:
            body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:-1])
        else:
            body = "\n\n".join(parts[1:])
if metadata:
    print(f"title\t\tbody")
else:
    print(f"title\tbody")
[/PYTHON]

What will be the input of the code snippet, given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "firstline\tsecond line"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[THOUGHT]
From `title = parts[0] = "firstline" ` we can know that the first part from splitting the cleaned docstring must have been "firstline"
From `body = "second line"` we can know that there must have been at least one more part after the first, and it must not have been parsed as valid metadata.
Since the is only 1 '\t' in the output, we can know that `metadata = {}`.
From `metadata = {}` we can know that either there was no metadata section, or an attempt to parse metadata failed (raised HeaderParseError).
From the above, we can reconstruct: `parts = ['firstline', 'secondline']`. 
This means the cleaned docstring must have looked like: `firstline\n\nsecond line`. This would split into two parts when re.split(r'\n{2,}', ...) is applied.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "firstline\n\nsecond line"
}
```
[/INPUT]
[/EXAMPLE]
[PYTHON]
def ok(last4):
    for i in range(4):
        t = list(last4)
        if i >= 1:
            t[i], t[i - 1] = (t[i - 1], t[i])
        if ' '.join(t).count('AGC') >= 1:
            return False
    return True

def dfs(cur, last3):
    if last3 in memo[cur]:
        return memo[cur][last3]
    if cur == n:
        return 1
    ret = 0
    for c in 'ACGT':
        if ok(last3 + c):
            ret = (ret + dfs(cur + 1, last3[1:] + c)) % mod
    memo[cur][last3] = ret
    return ret
n = int(input())
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
memo = [{} for i in range(n + 1)]
print(dfs(0, 'TTT'))
