[THOUGHT]
The function `doit` is called with arguments `p="zoo"` and `q="0"`. In SymPy, "zoo" represents complex infinity (`S.ComplexInfinity`), and "0" represents zero (`S.Zero`). 

The first condition in `doit` checks:
```python
if p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or (q is nan):
    return nan
```
- `p.is_infinite` is `True` because `S.ComplexInfinity` is infinite.
- `q.is_infinite` is `False` since `S.Zero` is finite.
- `p is nan` and `q is nan` are `False` as neither is NaN.

Thus, the condition evaluates to `True`, and the function returns `nan` (SymPy's NaN, represented as `S.NaN`). The output should be the string representation "nan".
