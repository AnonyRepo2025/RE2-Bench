[THOUGHT]
The function `call_command` is called with:
- `command_name`: "transaction"
- `kwargs`: `{"stdout": {}, "no_color": true}`

1. Since `command_name` is a string, `get_commands()` is called to find the app for "transaction". In Django, "transaction" is a core command, so `get_commands()` returns `'django.core'` for this command.
2. `load_command_class('django.core', 'transaction')` imports the `Command` class from `django.core.management.commands.transaction` and instantiates it.
3. The command's `create_parser` method builds a parser. The `kwargs` include "stdout" (a stealth option) and "no_color" (a valid option from base arguments).
4. During argument processing:
   - "stdout" is valid (stealth option).
   - "no_color" is valid (base argument).
   - No unknown options.
5. `defaults` includes "skip_checks": true (added automatically).
6. `command.execute(*args, **defaults)` is called. The "transaction" command requires a subcommand (commit/rollback), but none is provided in `args`.
7. The command writes an error to stderr: "This script requires at least one argument: commit or rollback." However, this output is not captured in the return value.
8. The command's `handle` method returns `None` after writing the error, so `execute` returns `None`.
9. Therefore, `call_command` returns `None`.

The output structure expects the return value under "output", which is `None` (represented as `null` in JSON).
