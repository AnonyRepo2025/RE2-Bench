[THOUGHT]
The input shows both `self` and `other` Media objects with `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` set to `null`. However, the Media class initializes these attributes to `[{}]` and `[[]]` respectively when created via `Media()`. The `__add__` method creates a new Media instance `combined` (which initializes to `_css_lists = [{}]` and `_js_lists = [[]]`), then attempts to copy `self._css_lists` and `self._js_lists` (which are `null`). This would normally cause a TypeError. But given the context, it's reasonable to interpret the input `null` as representing the initial state `[{}]` for `_css_lists` and `[[]]` for `_js_lists` (as set in `__init__`), since the class doesn't allow `None` for these attributes. 

Thus, processing proceeds as:
1. `combined = Media()` sets:
   - `combined._css_lists = [{}]`
   - `combined._js_lists = [[]]`
2. Copy from `self` (interpreted as `[{}]` and `[[]]`):
   - `combined._css_lists = self._css_lists[:]` → `[{}]`
   - `combined._js_lists = self._js_lists[:]` → `[[]]`
3. Process `other` (same as `self`): no new items appended since they already exist in the lists.
4. Return `combined` with `_css_lists = [{}]` and `_js_lists = [[]]`.
