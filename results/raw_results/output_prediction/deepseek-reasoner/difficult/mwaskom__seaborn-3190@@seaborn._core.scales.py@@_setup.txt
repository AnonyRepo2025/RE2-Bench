The function `ContinuousBase._setup` processes the input to configure a scale for a continuous variable. Given the input:

- `self.trans` is "log", indicating a logarithmic scale.
- `self._tick_params` is provided (non-null), so no call to `tick()` is made.
- `self._label_params` is null, so `new = new.label()` is called. Since the `label` method isn't defined in the provided code, `_label_params` is initialized to a default structure with `formatter`, `like`, and `unit` as null, and `base` as an empty dict.
- `prop.normed` is assumed false (not provided in input), so normalization is skipped (`normalize = null`).
- `prop.legend` is assumed false (not provided), so `_legend` remains null.
- The scale is logarithmic, so `_matplotlib_scale._transform` has `_shorthand_name` as "log" and `_invalid` as 0.0 (invalid for log(0)).
- The pipeline is built as `[axis.convert_units, forward, normalize, prop.get_mapping]`, represented as strings for functions and null for `normalize`.
- `_spacer` is set to a function in code, but the output structure requires an empty dict, so it's represented as `{}`.

The output is filled accordingly:
- `values`, `norm`, and `_legend` remain null.
- `trans` is "log".
- `_tick_params` matches the input.
- `_label_params` is the default structure.
- `_matplotlib_scale` reflects log transform details.
- `_pipeline` is an array describing the functions.
- `_spacer` is an empty dict.
