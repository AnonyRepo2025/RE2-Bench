[THOUGHT]
The input to `urlencode` is a list of key-value pairs: `[["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]` with `doseq=False`. 

1. The function checks if `query` is a `MultiValueDict` (it's not) or has an `items` method (it doesn't). 
2. Since it's already an iterable of pairs, it processes each pair directly.
3. For each pair:
   - Checks if value is `None` (none are)
   - Since `doseq=False`, treats each value as a single value (not a sequence)
   - Appends the (key, value) tuple to `query_params` unchanged
4. Calls `original_urlencode` with `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]` and `doseq=False`
5. `original_urlencode` converts non-string values to strings, resulting in the query string `"a=1&b=2&c=3"`

The output is the URL-encoded string of the input pairs.
