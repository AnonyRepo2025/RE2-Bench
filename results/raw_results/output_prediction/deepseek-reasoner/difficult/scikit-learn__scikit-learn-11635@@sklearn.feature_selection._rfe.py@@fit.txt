[THOUGHT]
The function `fit` in the `RFECV` class will fail during execution due to the following reasons:

1. **Input Validation Failure**: The input matrix `X` contains `nan` (Not a Number) and `inf` (infinity) values in the first sample: `[nan inf 1.4 0.2]`. The `check_X_y` function is called with `force_all_finite=False`, which allows non-finite values. However, when the estimator (e.g., a classifier) attempts to fit on this data, it will likely fail because most scikit-learn estimators do not handle `nan` or `inf` values by default. This will cause an exception during the parallel execution step.

2. **Estimator Compatibility**: The `self.estimator` is provided as `{"foo_param": 0}`, which is a dictionary and not a valid estimator object. The `check_scoring` function requires the estimator to have a `fit` method, which this dictionary lacks. This will raise a `TypeError` during the scoring setup.

Due to these issues, the function will not complete successfully, and the output attributes (like `support_`, `n_features_`, etc.) will not be set. The only values that can be determined are those passed as input parameters, while the rest remain undefined (represented as `XXX`).
