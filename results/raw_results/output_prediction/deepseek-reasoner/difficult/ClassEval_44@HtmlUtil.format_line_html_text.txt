[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the `format_line_html_text` method step by step with the given input:

1. **Input Check**: The input `html_text` is "<ul><li>Item 1</li></ul>", which is neither None nor empty, so processing continues.

2. **BeautifulSoup Parsing**: The HTML is parsed into a BeautifulSoup object. The structure is:
   ```html
   <ul>
     <li>Item 1</li>
   </ul>
   ```

3. **Code Tag Handling**: The method searches for `<pre>` or `<blockquote>` tags (using `soup.find_all(['pre', 'blockquote'])`). None are found, so no changes occur here.

4. **List Handling**: 
   - The method finds the `<ul>` tag (via `soup.find_all(['ul', 'ol'])`).
   - For each `<li>` within the `<ul>`:
     - Text is extracted and stripped: `"Item 1"`.
     - The last character (`1`) is **not** punctuation (as per `string.punctuation`), so the else branch triggers.
     - The `<li>` content is replaced with: `[-]Item 1.` (formatted as `"[{0}]{1}.".format('-', 'Item 1')`).

5. **Paragraph Handling**: The method searches for `<p>` tags. None are found, so this step is skipped.

6. **Text Extraction and Cleaning**:
   - `soup.get_text()` returns the modified text: `"[-]Item 1."`.
   - `gensim.utils.decode_htmlentities` is applied, but there are no HTML entities to decode, so the text remains unchanged.
   - `__format_line_feed` replaces sequences of newlines with a single `\n`. Since there are no newlines, the text stays `"[-]Item 1."`.

**Final Output**: The method returns `"[-]Item 1."`.
