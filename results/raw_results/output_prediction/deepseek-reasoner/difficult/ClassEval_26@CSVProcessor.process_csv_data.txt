[THOUGHT]
The `process_csv_data` method processes a CSV file by:
1. Reading the CSV file (`read_test.csv`) to get a title row and data rows.
2. Extracting the column at index `N=1` (second column) from each data row.
3. Converting each value in that column to uppercase.
4. Creating new data: `[title, column_data]` where:
   - `title` is the original header row (list of columns)
   - `column_data` is the list of uppercase values from column 1
5. Writing this new data to `read_test_process.csv` using `write_csv`.

The `write_csv` method returns:
- `1` if writing succeeds
- `0` if any exception occurs

Since the input doesn't specify file content or errors, we assume:
- `read_test.csv` exists and is readable
- All rows have at least 2 columns (index 1 is valid)
- Writing to `read_test_process.csv` succeeds

Thus, `write_csv` returns `1`, which becomes the output of `process_csv_data`.
