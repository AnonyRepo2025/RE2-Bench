The provided code uses a depth-first search (DFS) with memoization to count the number of valid DNA sequences of length `n` (where `n` is the input value) composed of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. The sequences must avoid any occurrence of the substring "AGC" and any sequence that, after swapping adjacent characters, would contain "AGC". However, due to a specific implementation detail in the `ok` function, the check for invalid sequences does not work as intended.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The input is `18`, read as an integer `n`.
2. **Initialization**: 
   - `mod = 10**9 + 7` (modulus for large numbers).
   - `memo` is a list of dictionaries for memoization, indexed from 0 to `n`.
3. **DFS Function**:
   - The DFS starts at `cur = 0` (current position) with the initial last three characters `last3 = 'TTT'` (a dummy value for the initial state).
   - For each state `(cur, last3)`, if `cur == n`, it returns 1 (base case: one valid sequence found).
   - Otherwise, it iterates over each possible nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T').
4. **Validation (`ok` function)**:
   - For each candidate nucleotide `c`, form a 4-character string `last4 = last3 + c`.
   - The `ok` function checks if `last4` or any of its adjacent swaps (at positions 0-1, 1-2, or 2-3) contain the substring "AGC".
   - **Critical Issue**: The check uses `' '.join(t)`, which inserts spaces between characters (e.g., `['A','G','C','T']` becomes `"A G C T"`). This means the substring "AGC" (without spaces) can never appear in the spaced string, so `ok` always returns `True`.
5. **Consequence**:
   - Since `ok` always returns `True`, every nucleotide is allowed at every step.
   - The total number of sequences is simply all possible sequences of length `n`, which is \(4^n\).
6. **Computation**:
   - For `n = 18`, \(4^{18} = 68719476736\).
   - Modulo \(10^9 + 7\): \(68719476736 \mod 1000000007 = 719476260\).

### Output Explanation:
The output is the count of valid sequences modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Due to the bug in the `ok` function, no sequences are filtered out, resulting in \(4^{18} \mod 1000000007 = 719476260\).
