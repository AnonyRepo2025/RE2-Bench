The `fit` method processes the input data in batches, updating the model incrementally. Given the input parameters and data:

- `batch_size` is provided as a string "38", but it is used as an integer 38 for batch processing.
- `n_components` is `None`, so it is determined by the data dimensions (min of samples and features in the first batch).
- The data has 70 samples and 3 features. Batches are:
  - Batch 1: 38 samples
  - Batch 2: 32 samples
- After processing:
  - `n_components_` is 3 (min of 38 samples and 3 features in the first batch).
  - `n_samples_seen_` is 70 (total samples).
  - `noise_variance_` is 0.0 (since `n_components_` equals the number of features).
  - Other attributes (`components_`, `mean_`, `var_`, `singular_values_`, `explained_variance_`, `explained_variance_ratio_`) are computed from the data.

The output structure is filled accordingly, with arrays represented as nested lists of their computed values.
