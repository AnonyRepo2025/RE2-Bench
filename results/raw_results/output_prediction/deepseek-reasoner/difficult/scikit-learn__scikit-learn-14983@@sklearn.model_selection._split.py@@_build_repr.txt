[THOUGHT]
The function `_build_repr` generates a string representation of an object by inspecting its `__init__` parameters. Given the input `self` with attribute `n_groups=3`:

1. The class name is determined as `self.__class__.__name__`. Based on the context of the provided `__all__` list and the attribute `n_groups`, the class is inferred as `LeavePGroupsOut` (the only class in `__all__` with an `n_groups` parameter).
2. The `__init__` parameters are extracted. For `LeavePGroupsOut`, the `__init__` has one parameter: `n_groups`.
3. The value of `n_groups` is retrieved from `self` as `3`.
4. No other parameters exist, and no deprecation warnings are triggered.
5. The output string is formatted as `"LeavePGroupsOut(n_groups=3)"`.

Thus, the output is the string representation of the object.
