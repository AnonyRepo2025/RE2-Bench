[THOUGHT]
The function `powdenest` is called with `eq="_x"`, `force=False`, and `polar=False`. Since `force` is False, the first conditional block is skipped. The `polar` parameter is also False, so the second conditional block is skipped. The code then computes `new = powsimp(sympify(eq))`. 

1. `sympify(eq)` converts the string `"_x"` into a SymPy symbol `_x`.
2. `powsimp(_x)` is called. Since `_x` is a simple symbol with no powers or exponents, `powsimp` leaves it unchanged, returning `_x`.
3. The `Transform` with `_denest_pow` is applied via `xreplace`, but only to nodes that are `Pow` or `exp` instances. Since `_x` is a symbol and not a power or exponential expression, the transform doesn't modify it.
4. The final output is the symbol `_x`, which is represented as the string `"_x"` in the output structure.

Thus, the output value for `"output"` is `"_x"`.
