[THOUGHT]
The `check_winner` method scans the board for five consecutive identical symbols in any direction. The board has two winning lines:
1. Row 0: Five 'O's horizontally from (0,0) to (0,4)
2. Row 5: Five 'X's horizontally from (5,1) to (5,5)

The method checks cells in row-major order (top-left to bottom-right). At (0,0), it detects the horizontal 'O' win immediately and returns 'O'. It never reaches the 'X' win at row 5 because it exits early upon finding the first winner.

Thus, the output is 'O'.
