[THOUGHT]
The function `replace_named_groups` processes regex patterns to replace named groups. The input pattern is "admin/password_change/done/", which contains no regex syntax (no parentheses or named groups). 

Steps:
1. `named_group_matcher` searches for `\(\?P<(\w+)>` (named group patterns). The input has zero matches.
2. Since no named groups are found, the `for` loops don't execute.
3. The original pattern is returned unchanged.

Thus, the output is identical to the input pattern.
