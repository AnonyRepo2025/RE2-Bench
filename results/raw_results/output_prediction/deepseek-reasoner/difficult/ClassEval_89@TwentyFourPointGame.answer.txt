[THOUGHT]
The function `answer` processes the expression "1+1+1+2" with available numbers [1, 1, 1, 1]. 

1. **Build frequency map from expression**: 
   - Iterate over each character in "1+1+1+2":
     - '1' (digit, and 1 is in [1,1,1,1]) → increment count for '1' to 1, then 2, then 3.
     - '+' (non-digit) → skip.
     - '2' (digit, but 2 not in [1,1,1,1]) → skip.
   - Result: `statistic = {'1': 3}`.

2. **Check usage against available numbers**:
   - `nums_used = {'1': 3}` (copy of `statistic`).
   - Iterate over each number in `self.nums = [1, 1, 1, 1]`:
     - First 1: `nums_used['1']` is 3 (≠ -100 and >0) → decrement to 2.
     - Second 1: `nums_used['1']` is 2 → decrement to 1.
     - Third 1: `nums_used['1']` is 1 → decrement to 0.
     - Fourth 1: `nums_used['1']` is 0 (≠ -100 but not >0) → enter `else` branch and **return `False` immediately**.

The function returns `False` because the fourth available number (1) is not used in the expression (the frequency count for '1' is exhausted after the first three uses). The extraneous '2' in the expression is ignored, but the failure occurs due to the unused available number.
