[THOUGHT]
The `to_python` method in `URLField` processes the input URL through several steps:
1. First, it calls `super().to_python(value)`, which (since `URLField` inherits from `CharField`) trims whitespace if `strip=True` (which it is in the input). The input value `"http://www.example.com/category/"` has no leading/trailing spaces, so it remains unchanged.
2. The URL is split into components using `urlsplit`: 
   - Scheme: `"http"`
   - Netloc: `"www.example.com"`
   - Path: `"/category/"`
   - Query: `""`
   - Fragment: `""`
3. Since the scheme is non-empty, it is not replaced with `self.assume_scheme` ("https").
4. The netloc is also non-empty, so the inner block (which handles netloc correction) is skipped.
5. The URL is reassembled with `urlunsplit`, producing the original URL string.

No transformations occur since the input URL already has a valid scheme and netloc. The output is identical to the input.
