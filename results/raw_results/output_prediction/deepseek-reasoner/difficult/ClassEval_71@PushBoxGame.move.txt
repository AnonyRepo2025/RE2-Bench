[THOUGHT]
We are given the state of a PushBoxGame instance and a move direction "s" (down). The current state is:
- Map: 
  - Row 0: "#####"
  - Row 1: "#O  #" → Player starts at (1,2) which is a space
  - Row 2: "# X #" → (2,2) is 'X' (likely a box, but state says box is at (3,2))
  - Row 3: "#  G#" → Target is at (3,3) ('G')
  - Row 4: "#####"
- Player position: (1,2)
- Boxes: [(3,2)] (one box at row 3, column 2)
- Targets: [(3,3)] (one target at row 3, column 3)
- Target count: 1
- Game over: false

Step-by-step execution of `move('s')`:
1. Calculate new player position: (1+1, 2) = (2,2)
2. Check map at (2,2): The tile is 'X' (not '#'), so movement is allowed.
3. Check if (2,2) contains a box: The boxes list is [(3,2)], so (2,2) is not a box → Player moves to (2,2).
4. Update player position to (2,2).
5. Call `check_win()`:
   - Box at (3,2) is checked against targets [(3,3)] → not on target.
   - box_on_target_count = 0, which ≠ target_count (1) → game remains not over.
6. Return `False` (game not won).

The box was not moved because the player didn't push it (the new position wasn't occupied by a box). The 'X' at (2,2) is likely a static map element (not a box in this state), so the player moves there freely. The game state after the move has player at (2,2) and box still at (3,2), not on the target.
