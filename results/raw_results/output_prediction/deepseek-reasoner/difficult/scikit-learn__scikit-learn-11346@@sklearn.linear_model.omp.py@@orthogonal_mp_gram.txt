The function `orthogonal_mp_gram` is called with the provided inputs. The key parameters are:
- `Gram`: A 12x12 symmetric matrix (inner products)
- `Xy`: A 12x1 vector (inner products with the target)
- `n_nonzero_coefs`: 1 (only one non-zero coefficient allowed)
- `tol`: None (not used)
- `norms_squared`: [4.64744652] (squared norm of the target, unused since tol=None)
- `copy_Xy`: False (no copy needed)

The algorithm performs orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) on the Gram matrix. Since `n_nonzero_coefs=1`, it selects the atom (column) in the dictionary with the highest absolute correlation with the residual (initialized to `Xy`). 

Steps:
1. Find the index of the maximum absolute value in `Xy`:
   - `Xy` = [0.1260535, -0.4460294, 0.29305911, -0.84156526, 2.15579371, -1.60930398, -0.25892627, -1.34654783, 1.24704881, 0.66923821, -0.16778773, -0.09414498]
   - The maximum absolute value is 2.15579371 at index 4.

2. Since this is the first (and only) iteration, the coefficient for index 4 is set to the value from `Xy[4]` (2.15579371) because the diagonal of the Gram matrix at (4,4) is 1.0 (normalized atom), making the solution straightforward.

3. All other coefficients are set to 0.0.

4. The output is a 12-element vector with zeros except at index 4, which contains 2.15579371.

Thus, the output array is:
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.15579371, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
