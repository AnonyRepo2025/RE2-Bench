[THOUGHT]
The function `fraction(expr, exact=False)` processes the input expression `-x**3` as follows:
1. The expression `-x**3` is sympified to `Mul(Integer(-1), Pow(Symbol('x'), Integer(3)))`.
2. Using `Mul.make_args`, the expression is decomposed into multiplicative terms: `[-1, x**3]`.
3. For each term:
   - The term `-1` is a `Rational`. It is split into numerator `-1` and denominator `1` using `as_numer_denom()`, so `-1` is added to the numerator list and `1` to the denominator list.
   - The term `x**3` is a `Pow` with a positive exponent. Since `exact=False`, it is added directly to the numerator list.
4. The numerator list becomes `[-1, x**3]`, and the denominator list is `[1]`.
5. With `exact=False`, the function returns `(Mul(-1, x**3), Mul(1))`, which simplifies to `(-x**3, 1)`.
6. The output is represented as a tuple of two expressions: `(-x**3, 1)`. In JSON, this is serialized as a list of string representations: `["-x**3", "1"]`.
