[THOUGHT]
The input expression is `exp(-I*pi*a/2) * besseli(a, 2*sqrt(x)) * exp_polar(I*pi/2)`. The function `besselsimp` processes Bessel functions through several steps:

1. **Initial replacements for Bessel functions**: The function attempts to rewrite `besselj` and `besseli` in terms of each other if their arguments contain specific factors (I, exp_polar(I*pi/2), etc.). Here, the argument of `besseli` is `2*sqrt(x)`, which contains none of these factors, so no rewrite occurs.

2. **Replacements for negative arguments**: The function checks if the Bessel function arguments contain factors like -1 or exp_polar(I*pi). Since `2*sqrt(x)` has neither, no replacement is made.

3. **Expansion for special orders**: The function expands Bessel functions for half-integer or integer orders > 1. The order `a` is a symbolic variable (not a specific number), so no expansion occurs.

4. **Final factorization**: Since no changes were made, the expression remains unchanged. The output is the same as the input: a product of three factors: `exp(-I*pi*a/2)`, `besseli(a, 2*sqrt(x))`, and `exp_polar(I*pi/2)`.

The output structure requires the expression's top-level arguments (from the `Mul` object) as a list under `_elements`. The factors are listed in canonical order (Bessel function first, then exponential terms).
