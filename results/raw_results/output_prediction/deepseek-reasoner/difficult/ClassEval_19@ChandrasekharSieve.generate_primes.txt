[THOUGHT]
The `generate_primes` method implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to `n=15`. The method does not use the existing `self.primes` value; it recomputes the primes from scratch using `self.n=15`. Here's the step-by-step execution:

1. Initialize a sieve list of size 16 (indices 0 to 15) with all `True` values.
2. Mark sieve[0] and sieve[1] as `False` (non-prime).
3. Start with `p=2`:
   - Mark multiples of 2 (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) as `False`.
4. Move to `p=3`:
   - Mark multiples of 3 starting from 9 (9, 12, 15) as `False`.
5. Move to `p=4` (already marked `False` → skip).
6. Move to `p=5` (5²=25 > 15 → loop ends).
7. Collect primes: indices where sieve is `True` (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

The result is `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`, which matches the existing `self.primes` in the input, but this is coincidental since the method recomputes it independently.
