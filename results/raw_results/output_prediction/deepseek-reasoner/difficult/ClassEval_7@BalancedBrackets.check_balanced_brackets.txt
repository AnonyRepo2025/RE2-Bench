[THOUGHT]
The `BalancedBrackets` instance is initialized with:
- `stack` initially `["["]`
- `expr` is `"[(){}"`
- `left_brackets` and `right_brackets` are default

When `check_balanced_brackets()` is called:
1. `clear_expr()` removes non-bracket characters, but `"[(){}"` contains only brackets, so `expr` remains unchanged.
2. The method iterates over each character in `expr`:
   - First char `'['`: left bracket → push to stack → stack becomes `['[', '[']`
   - Second char `'('`: left bracket → push → stack becomes `['[', '[', '(']`
   - Third char `')'`: right bracket → pop `'('` from stack → `'('` matches `')'` → stack becomes `['[', '[']`
   - Fourth char `'{'`: left bracket → push → stack becomes `['[', '[', '{']`
   - Fifth char `'}'`: right bracket → pop `'{'` → matches → stack becomes `['[', '[']`
3. After iteration, stack is `['[', '[']` (not empty) → returns `False`.

The initial stack state (`['[']`) is preserved and used in the process, contributing to the unbalanced result.
