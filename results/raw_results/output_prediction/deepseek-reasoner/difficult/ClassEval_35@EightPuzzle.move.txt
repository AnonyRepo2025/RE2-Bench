[THOUGHT]
The `move` method in the EightPuzzle class performs a move in the specified direction by swapping the blank tile (0) with an adjacent tile. Given:
- Current state: [[1, 6, 2], [7, 8, 0], [4, 5, 3]]
- Direction: "left"

Steps:
1. Find the blank (0) position: 
   - Row 1, Column 2 (since state[1][2] = 0)
2. For a "left" move, swap the blank with the tile to its left (position [1][1], value 8)
3. Create a deep copy of the state to avoid mutation
4. Perform swap: 
   - new_state[1][1] becomes 0
   - new_state[1][2] becomes 8
5. Resulting state: 
   - Row 0 remains [1, 6, 2]
   - Row 1 becomes [7, 0, 8] (after swapping)
   - Row 2 remains [4, 5, 3]

The output is the new state after the move: [[1, 6, 2], [7, 0, 8], [4, 5, 3]]
