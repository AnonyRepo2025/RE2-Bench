[THOUGHT]
The code builds a list `li` by processing numbers from 1 to 370 (inclusive). For each number:
- Single-digit numbers (1-9) are added directly to the list.
- Two-digit numbers (10-99) are split into individual digits (e.g., 10 becomes [1, 0]).
- Three-digit numbers (100-370) are similarly split into digits (e.g., 100 becomes [1, 0, 0]).

After processing all numbers, the list has 1002 elements. The last two elements are removed using `li.pop()` twice, resulting in a final list of 1000 elements.

The input is 423, so the code retrieves the element at index 422 (since `n-1 = 422`).

The list composition:
- Indices 0-8: Digits 1-9 (9 elements).
- Indices 9-188: Digits from two-digit numbers 10-99 (180 elements).
- Indices 189-999: Digits from three-digit numbers 100-370 (813 elements before popping; 811 after popping affects only the end).

To find the element at index 422:
- The three-digit section starts at index 189.
- The offset within three-digit digits: 422 - 189 = 233.
- Each three-digit number contributes 3 digits, so the number index is 233 // 3 = 77 (0-based), and the digit position is 233 % 3 = 2.
- The 77th three-digit number is 100 + 77 = 177.
- The digits of 177 are [1, 7, 7] (after splitting and reversing).
- The digit at position 2 (0-based) is 7.

Thus, the element at index 422 is 7.

The output is printed as an integer.
