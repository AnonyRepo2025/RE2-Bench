The provided input is `"1 200000"`, which after JSON parsing becomes the string `"1 200000"` (including double quotes). However, the program expects two integers without quotes. This would cause a `ValueError` when converting `'"1'` to an integer. Given the context of the problem and the first example (which did not have quotes), the intended input is assumed to be without quotes. Thus, the input string is treated as `"1 200000"` (without quotes), resulting in `K=1` and `N=200000`.

The program initializes an array `X` of length `2*K-1 = 1` with zeros. It computes factorials and their modular inverses up to `N+K = 200001`. For `k` in `range(2, K+2)` (i.e., `k=2` only):
- `l = k // 2 = 1`
- Loop `m` from `0` to `min(l+1, N//2+1) = min(2, 100001) = 2` (i.e., `m=0` and `m=1`):
  - For `m=0`:  
    `prod = 1 * (frac[1] * frac[200000]) * (invf[0] * invf[1]) * (invf[200000] * invf[0]) mod 998244353`  
    `= frac[200000] * invf[200000] = 1`
  - For `m=1`:  
    `prod = -1 * (frac[1] * frac[199998]) * (invf[1] * invf[0]) * (invf[199998] * invf[0]) mod 998244353`  
    `= -frac[199998] * invf[199998] = -1`
- Sum `S = (1 - 1) mod 998244353 = 0`
- Set `X[0] = 0` (and redundantly `X[0]` again to `0`)

The program then prints `X[0]`, which is `0`.
