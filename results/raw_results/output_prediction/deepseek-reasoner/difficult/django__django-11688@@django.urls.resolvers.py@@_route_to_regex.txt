[THOUGHT]
The function `_route_to_regex` processes the route string by breaking it into literal parts and parameter components. The input route is `"<lang>"/"<path:url>"` (after JSON unescaping). The pattern `_PATH_PARAMETER_COMPONENT_RE` matches parameter components like `<parameter>` or `<converter:parameter>`. 

Step-by-step processing:
1. The route starts with a double quote (`"`), which is escaped as `\\"`.
2. The first parameter `<lang>` has no explicit converter, so it defaults to 'str'. The regex part becomes `(?P<lang>[^/]+)`.
3. The next literal part is `"/"`, which is escaped as `\\"\\/\\"`.
4. The second parameter `<path:url>` uses the 'path' converter, so the regex part is `(?P<url>.+)`.
5. The route ends with a double quote (`"`), escaped as `\\"`.
6. Since `is_endpoint=True`, the regex ends with `$`.

The converters dictionary maps:
- 'lang' to the 'str' converter
- 'url' to the 'path' converter

The final regex pattern is:
`^\\"(?P<lang>[^/]+)\\"\\/\\"(?P<url>.+)\\"$`

For JSON output, backslashes and double quotes are escaped:
- Each backslash becomes `\\\\`
- Each double quote becomes `\\\"`

Thus, the regex string in JSON is:
`^\\\\\\\"(?P<lang>[^/]+)\\\\\\\"\\\\/\\\\\\\"(?P<url>.+)\\\\\\\"$`

The output is a tuple containing this regex string and the converters dictionary.
