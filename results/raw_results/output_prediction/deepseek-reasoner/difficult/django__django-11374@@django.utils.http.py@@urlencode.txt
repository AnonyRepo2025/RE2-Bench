The `urlencode` function processes the input query parameters. Given the input:
- `query` is a list of lists: `[["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]`
- `doseq` is not provided, so it defaults to `False`

Step-by-step execution:
1. The function checks if `query` is a `MultiValueDict` (it's not).
2. It checks if `query` has an `items` method (it doesn't, since it's a list).
3. The function iterates over each `[key, value]` pair in the list:
   - For `["a", 1]`: `value` is not `None`, and since `doseq=False`, `query_val = 1` (no conversion needed).
   - For `["b", 2]`: same as above, `query_val = 2`.
   - For `["c", 3]`: same as above, `query_val = 3`.
4. The resulting `query_params` list is `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`.
5. This is passed to `original_urlencode` (the standard `urllib.parse.urlencode`), which converts integers to strings and URL-encodes the parameters. Since all keys/values are alphanumeric, no special encoding is needed.
6. The output is the string `"a=1&b=2&c=3"`.
