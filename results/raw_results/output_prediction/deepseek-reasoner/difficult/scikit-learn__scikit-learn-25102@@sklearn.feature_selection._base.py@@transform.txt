The `transform` method processes input `X` through several steps:
1. **Validation and Conversion**: The input `X` is a sparse matrix in CSC format. The `_validate_data` method converts it to CSR format because `accept_sparse='csr'` is specified. The original matrix has shape (2, 10) with data representing:
   - Row 0: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
   - Row 1: [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
   After conversion to CSR:
     - `data`: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
     - `indices`: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
     - `indptr`: [0, 9, 19]

2. **Feature Selection**: The `_get_support_mask` method (abstract in `SelectorMixin`) is assumed to return a boolean mask based on `step=2` (from input `self`). The mask selects every other feature starting from index 0: [True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False, True, False]. This selects columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

3. **Applying Mask**: The `_safe_indexing` function filters columns:
   - **Row 0**: Original columns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] → Keep columns 2, 4, 6, 8 (values 2, 4, 6, 8) at new column indices 1, 2, 3, 4.
   - **Row 1**: Original columns [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] → Keep columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (values 10, 12, 14, 16, 18) at new column indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
   - New `data`: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
   - New `indices` (column indices in CSR): [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
   - New `indptr`: [0, 4, 9] (row 0 has 4 elements, row 1 has 5 elements)
   - New shape: (2, 5)

4. **Output**: The `maxprint` attribute remains unchanged (50). The output is a CSR matrix with the computed attributes.
