[THOUGHT]
The function `_construct_simple` is called with `coeffs=None` and `opt={}`. The first operation in the function accesses `opt.extension` (line: `if opt.extension is True:`). Since `opt` is an empty dictionary, it has no attribute `extension`, raising an `AttributeError`. The function does not handle this exception, so it terminates abnormally without returning a value. Therefore, the output is `null`.
