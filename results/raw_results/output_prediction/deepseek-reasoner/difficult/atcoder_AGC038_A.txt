To solve this problem, we need to simulate the execution of the provided Python code step by step for the given input. The code reads four integers: `H`, `W`, `A`, and `B`, and then constructs a grid of size `H x W` based on specific conditions. The grid is then printed row by row.

### Approach
1. **Input Parsing**: The input is read as a single string, which is split into tokens to extract the four integers: `H`, `W`, `A`, and `B`.
2. **Grid Initialization**: A 2D list (grid) of size `H x W` is initialized with all elements set to `'0'`.
3. **Grid Population**:
   - For each cell at position `(i, j)` (where `i` is the row index and `j` is the column index):
     - If `i < B` and `j >= A`, the cell is set to `'1'`.
     - If `i >= B` and `j < A`, the cell is set to `'1'`.
     - All other cells remain `'0'`.
4. **Output**: The grid is printed row by row, with each row joined into a single string.

### Key Insight
Given the input values `H = 1000`, `W = 1000`, `A = 0`, and `B = 486`:
- Since `A = 0`, the condition `j < A` (i.e., `j < 0`) is always false because column indices `j` range from `0` to `W-1` (non-negative). Thus, the grid population simplifies:
  - For rows `0` to `485` (i.e., `i < B`), all cells are set to `'1'`.
  - For rows `486` to `999` (i.e., `i >= B`), all cells are set to `'0'`.

### Output Structure
The output consists of `H` lines (1000 lines), where:
- The first 486 lines are strings of 1000 `'1'` characters each.
- The remaining 514 lines are strings of 1000 `'0'` characters each.
- Each line is followed by a newline character.

### Solution Code
The output is a string of 1000 lines:
- Lines 1 to 486: `'1'` repeated 1000 times.
- Lines 487 to 1000: `'0'` repeated 1000 times.
- Each line ends with a newline character.

### Final Output
The output is a multi-line string where:
- The first 486 lines are `"1" * 1000`.
- The next 514 lines are `"0" * 1000`.
- Each line is terminated with a newline (`\n`).

[THOUGHT]
The input values are H=1000, W=1000, A=0, B=486.
- Since A=0, the condition "j < A" is always false (j ranges from 0 to 999).
- For i < B (i.e., i from 0 to 485): every cell in these rows is set to '1'.
- For i >= B (i.e., i from 486 to 999): every cell in these rows is set to '0'.
The grid has 1000 rows:
- Rows 0 to 485: each is a string of 1000 '1's.
- Rows 486 to 999: each is a string of 1000 '0's.
Each row is printed with a newline. The output is a string of 1000 lines, with 486 lines of "1"*1000 and 514 lines of "0"*1000, each followed by a newline.
