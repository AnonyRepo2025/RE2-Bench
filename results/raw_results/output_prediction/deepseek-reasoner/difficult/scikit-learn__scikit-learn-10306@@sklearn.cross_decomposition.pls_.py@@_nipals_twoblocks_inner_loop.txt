To determine the output of `_nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop`, we simulate its execution step by step using the provided inputs. The function performs an iterative algorithm (NIPALS) for partial least squares, and the inputs are:

- `X`: A 4x3 matrix
- `Y`: A 4x2 matrix where the first column is near-zero
- `mode`: 'B' (uses pseudoinverse)
- `max_iter`: 500
- `tol`: 1e-06
- `norm_y_weights`: True

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `y_score` starts as the first column of `Y` (near-zero values).
   - `x_weights_old` is initialized to 0.
   - Since `mode='B'`, we compute the pseudoinverse of `X` (`X_pinv`) and `Y` (`Y_pinv`).

2. **First Iteration**:
   - Compute `x_weights` = `X_pinv` @ `y_score` → near-zero vector.
   - Due to near-zero magnitude, add `eps` (machine epsilon) to `x_weights` and normalize → becomes approximately `[0.577, 0.577, 0.577]` (1/√3).
   - Compute `x_score` = `X` @ `x_weights` → vector of row sums of `X` scaled by 1/√3.
   - Compute `y_weights` = `Y_pinv` @ `x_score` → `[0, 0.0088]` (approximately).
   - Normalize `y_weights` → becomes `[0, 1]`.
   - Update `y_score` = `Y` @ `y_weights` / norm → second column of `Y`.
   - Check convergence: Difference between `x_weights` and `x_weights_old` (0) is large (norm=1), so continue.

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - Compute `x_weights` = `X_pinv` @ `y_score` (now the second column of `Y`).
   - This yields `x_weights` ≈ `[-0.065, -0.159, 0.106]` (exact values depend on `X_pinv`).
   - Normalize `x_weights` → approximately `[-0.338, -0.828, 0.552]`.
   - Compute `x_score` = `X` @ `x_weights`.
   - Compute `y_weights` = `Y_pinv` @ `x_score` → approximately `[0, 1]` (no significant change).
   - Normalize `y_weights` → remains `[0, 1]`.
   - Check convergence: Difference between current and previous `x_weights` (from iteration 1) has a norm > `tol` (1e-06), so continue.

4. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - The algorithm continues updating `x_weights` and `y_weights`.
   - After 2 iterations, convergence is not reached (change in `x_weights` exceeds `tol`).
   - The loop runs until either convergence or `max_iter` (500) is reached. Given the inputs, it converges before hitting `max_iter`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple `(x_weights, y_weights, ite)`, where:
     - `x_weights`: Converged weights for `X` (3-element list).
     - `y_weights`: Converged weights for `Y` (2-element list), stabilized near `[0, 1]`.
     - `ite`: Iteration count at convergence (exact value depends on tolerance checks).

### Predicted Output:
The exact values of `x_weights` and `ite` depend on iterative computations, but based on the algorithm's behavior with the inputs:
- `x_weights` stabilizes to a specific 3-element vector.
- `y_weights` remains `[0, 1]` due to `Y`'s structure.
- `ite` is 2 (convergence occurs within a few iterations).
