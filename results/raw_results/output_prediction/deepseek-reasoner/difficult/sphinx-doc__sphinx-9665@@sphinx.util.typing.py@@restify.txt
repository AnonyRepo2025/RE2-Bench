[THOUGHT]
The input to `restify` has `cls` set to `null` (which is `None` in Python). Looking at the function:

1. The first condition checks: `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`
2. Since `cls` is `None`, this condition is true.
3. The function returns `':py:obj:`None`'`

Therefore, the output will be the string `':py:obj:`None`'`.

The output structure requires a JSON object with key "output" containing this string.
