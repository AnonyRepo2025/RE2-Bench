[THOUGHT]
We are processing the input string "1000000" using the NumberWordFormatter class.

Steps:
1. Split the input by decimal point: 
   - lstr = "1000000" (integer part)
   - rstr = "" (no fractional part)

2. Reverse the integer part: 
   - "1000000" reversed is "0000001"

3. Pad the reversed string to make length divisible by 3:
   - Length of "0000001" is 7 → 7 % 3 = 1 → pad with "00" → becomes "000000100"

4. Split into 3-digit chunks (from the padded reversed string):
   - Chunk 0: indices 0-2 → "000" → reverse chunk → "000"
   - Chunk 1: indices 3-5 → "000" → reverse chunk → "000"
   - Chunk 2: indices 6-8 → "100" → reverse chunk → "001"

5. Process each chunk:
   - Chunk 0 ("000"): 
        - Is "000" → skip (outputs empty string)
   - Chunk 1 ("000"): 
        - Is "000" → skip (outputs empty string)
   - Chunk 2 ("001"):
        - Not "000" → process with trans_three()
        - trans_three("001"): 
            - First char '0' → call trans_two("01")
            - trans_two("01"): 
                - s[0]=='0' → return NUMBER[1] → "ONE"
        - Suffix for index 2: NUMBER_MORE[2] → "MILLION"
        - Result: "ONE MILLION"

6. Build integer part string:
   - lm = "ONE MILLION" (after stripping)

7. Fractional part:
   - rstr is empty → xs = ""

8. Final output:
   - Format: f'{lm.strip()} {xs}ONLY' → "ONE MILLION ONLY"

Thus, the output is "ONE MILLION ONLY".
