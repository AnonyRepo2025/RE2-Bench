The function `exptrigsimp` is designed to simplify expressions involving exponential and trigonometric functions. The input expression is `(1 + "exp(2)")/(y*(-1 + "exp(2)"))`, but the inner quotes are artifacts of JSON formatting. The actual expression is `(1 + exp(2))/(y*(-1 + exp(2)))`, which simplifies to `(exp(2) + 1)/(y*(exp(2) - 1))` due to the commutative property of addition.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Initial Expression Handling**:  
   The input string `"(1 + \"exp(2)\")/(y*(-1 + \"exp(2)\"))"` is parsed to the SymPy expression:  
   `(1 + exp(2))/(y*(-1 + exp(2)))`.

2. **Bottom-Up Transformation (`exp_trig`)**:
   - The expression is processed by `bottom_up` with `exp_trig`, which attempts to rewrite it in terms of `exp` or `cos`.  
   - The expression has no trigonometric or hyperbolic functions, so `exp_trig` returns the original form as it has the fewest operations.

3. **Pattern Matching in Function `f`**:
   - The expression is a `Mul`: `(1 + exp(2)) * (y*(-1 + exp(2))) ** (-1)`.  
   - The powers dictionary is `{ (1 + exp(2)): 1, (y*(-1 + exp(2))): -1 }`.  
   - The term `1 + exp(2)` is an `Add` with two terms. The function `signlog` processes `exp(2)`, returning `(1, 2)`.  
   - The pattern `1 - exp(2)` is not found in the dictionary, and the factor `y` prevents matching the hyperbolic pattern `(1 + exp(2))/(exp(2) - 1) = coth(1)`.  
   - No simplification occurs, and the expression remains unchanged.

4. **Hyperbolic and Trigonometric Checks**:
   - The expression has no hyperbolic or trigonometric functions, so subsequent rewrites (`hyper_as_trig`, `TR2i`) are skipped.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The expression is returned unmodified in its canonical form: `(exp(2) + 1)/(y*(exp(2) - 1))`.

### Output:
The output is the canonical string representation of the expression.
