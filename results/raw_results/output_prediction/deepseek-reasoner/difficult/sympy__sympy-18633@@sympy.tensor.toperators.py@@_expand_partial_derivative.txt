[THOUGHT]
The `_expand_partial_derivative` method is called on a `PartialDerivative` instance. The input shows that `self` has `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` set to `null`. The method begins by calling `self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)`. However, the input does not provide `self.expr` or `self.variables` (which are derived from `self.args`). Without these, the execution cannot proceed to compute new `args`, `indices`, `free`, or `dum`. The method then creates a new `PartialDerivative` object `obj` and sets its `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` attributes to the values from `_contract_indices_for_derivative`. Since the input lacks the necessary data to compute these values, and given that the initial `self` has these attributes as `null`, the output attributes remain `null`. The method may return early (e.g., if `args[0].free_symbols` is false), but without `args`, this cannot be determined. Thus, the output retains the `null` values from the input.
