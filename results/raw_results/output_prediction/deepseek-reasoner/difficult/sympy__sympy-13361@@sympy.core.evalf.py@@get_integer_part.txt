The function `get_integer_part` is called with `expr = 1/2`, `no = -1`, `options = {}`, and `return_ints = True`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Evaluation**:  
   The function first evaluates `expr` at 30 bits precision using `evalf(expr, 30, options)`. Since `1/2` is exactly 0.5, this returns:
   - Real part: `(0, 1, -1, 1)` (mpf tuple for 0.5)
   - Imaginary part: `None`
   - Real accuracy: 30 bits
   - Imaginary accuracy: `None`

2. **Gap Calculation**:  
   The gap for the real part is computed as `fastlog(0.5) - 30`. Since `fastlog(0.5)` (log₂|0.5|) is -1, the gap is `-1 - 30 = -31`. This is less than the margin (-10), so no re-evaluation occurs.

3. **Integer Part Calculation**:  
   The `calc_part` function processes the real part:
   - Converts the mpf `(0, 1, -1, 1)` to an integer via `to_int`, yielding `0` (since 0.5 rounds to 0).
   - Checks if the number is an integer (exponent ≠ 0 → not an integer).
   - Forms a new expression: `1/2 - 0 = 1/2`.
   - Evaluates this at 10 bits precision, getting `(0, 1, -1, 1)` (still 0.5).
   - Compares `mpf_cmp(0.5, 0) == 1`, which does not equal `no = -1`, so `nint` remains `0`.

4. **Imaginary Part**:  
   The imaginary part is `None`, so it defaults to `0`.

5. **Return Value**:  
   Since `return_ints = True`, the output is `(0, 0)` (real and imaginary integer parts).

Thus, the output is `[0, 0]`.
