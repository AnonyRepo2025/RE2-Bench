[THOUGHT]
The function `variable_type` processes a pandas Series to determine its type. Given the input:

1. **Check for categorical dtype**: The input vector doesn't specify a dtype, so this check is skipped.
2. **Check for all NA values**: 
   - `pd.isna(vector).all()` returns `True` because the Series is empty (as indicated by the empty block in `_mgr`).
   - This condition is met, so the function returns `VarType('numeric')`.

The `boolean_type` argument ("boolean") isn't used because the function exits early at the all-NA check. The empty Series is classified as numeric by default.
