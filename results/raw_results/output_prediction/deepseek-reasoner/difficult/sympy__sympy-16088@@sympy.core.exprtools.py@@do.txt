The input expression contains quoted substrings, which are not valid in a symbolic expression. However, the function `factor_terms` attempts to sympify the input. The expression `-("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3) + "sqrt(3)"*I*("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3)` is invalid due to the quotes around `"sqrt(21)"` and `"sqrt(3)"`. These should be function calls or symbols without quotes. After sympification, the expression remains unchanged because the quotes make it invalid, and no factoring is performed. The output is the same as the input expression, but without the inner quotes, as they are not part of the symbolic representation.

    "output": "-(\"sqrt(21)\" + 5)**(1/3) + \"sqrt(3)\"*I*(\"sqrt(21)\" + 5)**(1/3)"
