[THOUGHT]
The task is to determine the output of the `__repr__` method for the given input. The `__repr__` method in `BaseCrossValidator` calls `_build_repr(self)`. However, the implementation of `_build_repr` is not provided in the code snippet. 

Looking at the input:
- The object has two attributes: `test_fold` (value "[1 1 2 2]") and `unique_folds` (value "[1 2]").

In scikit-learn (which this code resembles), the `__repr__` method for estimators typically displays the class name and constructor parameters. The class name isn't provided in the input, but common classes with a `test_fold` attribute (like `PredefinedSplit`) would be represented as:
```
PredefinedSplit(test_fold=[1 1 2 2])
```

Since `unique_folds` is likely an internal attribute (not a constructor parameter), it won't be included in the output. The value of `test_fold` is directly used as shown in the input.

Thus, the output of `__repr__` is:
```
PredefinedSplit(test_fold=[1 1 2 2])
```

This matches the expected JSON structure where the output is a string.
