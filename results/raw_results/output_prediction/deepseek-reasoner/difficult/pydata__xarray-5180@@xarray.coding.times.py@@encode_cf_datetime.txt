The function `encode_cf_datetime` processes the input date string "2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000" with units "days since 2000-01-01" and calendar "gregorian". The date is converted to a numpy datetime64 object, and the time delta between the date and the reference date (2000-01-01) is calculated. The difference is exactly 10 days, which is divisible by the unit "days" (1 day). The result is cast to an integer, yielding 10. The units remain unchanged as "days since 2000-01-01" after cleanup, and the calendar is "gregorian". The output is a tuple containing the numeric value, units, and calendar.

[THOUGHT]
1. **Input Handling**: The input date is a string, but in the function's context, it's treated as a numpy datetime64[ns] scalar (as per xarray conventions).
2. **Units Cleanup**: The units "days since 2000-01-01" are validated and formatted, remaining unchanged.
3. **Calendar Check**: "gregorian" is a standard calendar, so standard datetime64 operations are used.
4. **Time Delta Calculation**: 
   - Reference date: 2000-01-01 (as pandas Timestamp).
   - Input date: 2000-01-11 (as pandas Timestamp).
   - Difference: 10 days (exactly divisible by 1 day unit).
5. **Result**: The numeric value is 10 (integer), with original units and calendar.
