[THOUGHT]
The function `_sqlite_datetime_parse` processes the input datetime string "2016-06-13 00:00:00" with both `tzname` and `conn_tzname` set to "UTC". 

1. The input `dt` is not None, so it proceeds to `typecast_timestamp(dt)`.
2. `typecast_timestamp` splits the string into date ("2016-06-13") and time ("00:00:00"). Since there's no '-' or '+' in the time part, it doesn't split further.
3. The date components are [2016, 06, 13] and time components are [00, 00, 00]. Microseconds are 0.
4. With `settings.USE_TZ` assumed True (due to timezone parameters), the datetime is created as `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)`, representing "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00".
5. Since `conn_tzname` is "UTC", `dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.timezone("UTC"))` doesn't change the datetime (already UTC).
6. `tzname` ("UTC") matches `conn_tzname` ("UTC"), so no timezone conversion occurs.
7. The function returns the datetime object. For JSON output, it's represented as a string in ISO-like format with space separator and timezone offset: "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00".
