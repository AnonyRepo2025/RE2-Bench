[THOUGHT]
The function `_eval_Eq` is called with `self` and `other` both represented as empty dictionaries in the input. The method first checks if `other` is an instance of `MatrixExpr`. Since `other` is provided as an empty dictionary (not a `MatrixExpr`), the condition `isinstance(other, MatrixExpr)` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the method immediately returns `False` without checking further conditions. The output is a boolean `false`.
