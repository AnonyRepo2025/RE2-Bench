The equation provided is `2*x - 3*y - 5 = 0`. The function `classify_diop` identifies this as a linear Diophantine equation. The solution involves finding integer solutions for `x` and `y`. 

1. **Equation analysis**: The equation is `2x - 3y = 5`.
2. **Particular solution**: Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, solve `2x - 3y = 1` (gcd of 2 and 3 is 1). The solution is `x = -1, y = -1` since `2*(-1) - 3*(-1) = -2 + 3 = 1`. Scaling by 5 gives a particular solution: `x = -5, y = -5` (since `2*(-5) - 3*(-5) = -10 + 15 = 5`).
3. **General solution**: The homogeneous equation is `2x - 3y = 0`, with solutions `x = 3k, y = 2k` for integer `k`. The general solution combines the particular and homogeneous solutions:  
   - `x = -5 + (-3)*t = -5 - 3t`  
   - `y = -5 - (2)*t = -5 - 2t`  
   where `t` is an integer parameter.

The function `diop_solve` returns this solution as a tuple of expressions in terms of `t`. The output is formatted as a string representation of this tuple.
