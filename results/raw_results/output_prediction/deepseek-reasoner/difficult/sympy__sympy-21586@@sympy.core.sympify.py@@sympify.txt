The input to `sympify` is the string `"{2.0, 3}"`. This string represents a set in mathematical notation. The `sympify` function processes this string through the following steps:

1. The input is a string, so it enters the string handling path.
2. Since `strict=False` (default), it attempts to parse the string using `parse_expr` with transformations.
3. The transformations include:
   - `standard_transformations`
   - `t_convert_xor` (since `convert_xor=True`)
   - No `t_rationalize` (since `rational=False`)
4. The string `"{2.0, 3}"` is parsed as a SymPy `FiniteSet` containing two elements:
   - `2.0` → Parsed as `Float(2.0)`
   - `3` → Parsed as `Integer(3)`
5. The resulting SymPy object is a `FiniteSet` with `_args` = `(Float(2.0), Integer(3))`.
6. The output structure requests `_args_set`, which refers to the set of arguments (elements) of the top-level expression. For `FiniteSet`, this is the set `{2.0, 3}`.
7. In JSON, sets are represented as lists. The elements are ordered numerically (2.0 < 3) for consistency.

Thus, the output `_args_set` is `[2.0, 3]`.
