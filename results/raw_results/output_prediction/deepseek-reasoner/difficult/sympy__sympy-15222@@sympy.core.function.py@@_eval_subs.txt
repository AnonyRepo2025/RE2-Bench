[THOUGHT]
The function `_eval_subs` is defined within the `Application` class. Given the input:

1. The condition checks:
   - `old.is_Function`: From the input, `old` has properties of a SymPy Function (like `_nargs`, `default_assumptions`, etc.), so this should be True.
   - `new.is_Function`: Similarly, `new` has `nargs` defined, indicating it's a function, so True.
   - `callable(old)` and `callable(new)`: Both are functions and thus callable, so True.
   - `old == self.func`: `self.func` returns the class of `self`. The input doesn't specify `self.func`, but `old` is a distinct object with different attributes (e.g., `_nargs=null` vs. `self.nargs={}`), so they are not equal → False.
   - `(len(self.args) in new.nargs)`: `self.args` isn't provided in the input, so its length is unknown. Additionally, `new.nargs` is `frozenset({1})`, which requires the length to be 1, but without `self.args`, this check cannot be satisfied → False.

2. Since the condition `(old == self.func) and (len(self.args) in new.nargs)` fails (due to `old != self.func` and missing `self.args`), the `if` block is skipped, and the function returns `None`.

Thus, the output is `null`.
