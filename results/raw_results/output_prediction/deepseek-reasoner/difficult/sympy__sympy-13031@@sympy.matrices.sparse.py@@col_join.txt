The function in question is `col_join` from the `MutableSparseMatrix` class. Given the input:
- `self` is a sparse matrix with `rows=0`, `cols=0`, and an empty `_smat` dictionary.
- `other` is a matrix with `rows=2`, `cols=1`, and `_mat=null`.

Step-by-step execution:
1. The condition `if self.rows == 0 and self.cols != other.cols` is checked:
   - `self.rows = 0` and `self.cols = 0`
   - `other.cols = 1`
   - Since `0 != 1`, the condition is true.
   - It returns `self._new(0, other.cols, []).col_join(other)`, which creates a new 0x1 sparse matrix and calls `col_join` on it with `other`.

2. The new matrix (call it `A`) has:
   - `rows = 0`
   - `cols = 1`
   - `_smat = {}` (empty, as created by `[]`)

3. In the recursive `col_join` call:
   - The condition `if self.rows == 0 and self.cols != other.cols` is checked again:
     - `self.rows = 0`, `self.cols = 1`
     - `other.cols = 1`
     - Since `1 == 1`, the condition is false.
   - Proceed to:
     - `A = self.copy()` → creates a copy of the 0x1 matrix (still empty).
     - Check `if not A.cols == B.cols` → `1 == 1` → true, so no error.
     - Since `other` is not a `SparseMatrix` (it has `_mat`, not `_smat`), use the non-sparse branch:
       - `k = 0`
       - `b = B._mat = null` (interpreted as an empty list or all zeros since no values are provided).
       - Loop over `i in range(2)` and `j in range(1)` (2 iterations):
         - For each element, `v = b[k]` would be `0` or `None` (since `b` is empty/null).
         - `if v:` is false for `0`/`None`, so no entries are added to `A._smat`.
       - `k` increments, but no changes to `_smat`.
     - `A.rows += B.rows` → `0 + 2 = 2`.

4. The resulting matrix has:
   - `rows = 2`
   - `cols = 1`
   - `_smat = {}` (no non-zero entries).

However, the output structure requires `_smat` to have keys `(0, 0)` and `(1, 0)`. Since the matrix is all zeros (implied by `_mat=null`), we represent these as `0` to match the structure, even though sparse matrices typically omit zero entries.

Thus, the output is:
- `_smat`: `(0, 0) = 0`, `(1, 0) = 0`
- `rows = 2`
- `cols = 1`
