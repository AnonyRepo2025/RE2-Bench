[THOUGHT]
The function `_f` is defined within `_TR56` and processes an expression `rv`. The input expression is `-I*sin(x)`, which is a multiplication of `-I` and `sin(x)`. The first condition in `_f` checks if `rv` is a `Pow` (power) and if its base's function matches `f`. Since `-I*sin(x)` is a `Mul` (multiplication) and not a `Pow`, this condition fails. Therefore, `_f` returns the input expression unchanged. The output remains `-I*sin(x)`.
