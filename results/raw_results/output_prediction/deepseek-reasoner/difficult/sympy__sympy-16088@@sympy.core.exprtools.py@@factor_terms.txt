The function `factor_terms` processes the input expression "R3 + R4 + 4050" as follows:

1. **Sympify the input**: The string "R3 + R4 + 4050" is converted to a SymPy `Add` expression: `Add(Symbol('R3'), Symbol('R4'), Integer(4050))`.
2. **Content extraction**: `as_content_primitive()` is called, which returns a content (rational factor) of `1` and the primitive expression `R3 + R4 + 4050`.
3. **Processing the Add expression**: The primitive expression is split into terms `[R3, R4, 4050]`. Each term is checked for the ability to extract a factor of `-1`:
   - All terms (coefficients 1, 1, 4050) can be multiplied by `-1` (e.g., `1.extract_multiplicatively(-1)` returns `-1`).
   - The content is negated (to `-1`), and terms become `[-R3, -R4, -4050]`.
4. **GCD factoring**: `gcd_terms` is called on `-R3 - R4 - 4050`. Since there are no common factors (GCD of coefficients 1, 1, 4050 is 1), the expression remains unchanged.
5. **Combine with content**: `_keep_coeff(-1, -R3 - R4 - 4050)` simplifies to `(-1) * (-R3 - R4 - 4050) = R3 + R4 + 4050`.
6. **Output**: The expression is unchanged and returned as the original string representation.

Thus, the output is the same as the input expression.
