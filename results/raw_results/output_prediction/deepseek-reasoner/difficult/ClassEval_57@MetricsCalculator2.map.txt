[THOUGHT]
The input `data` is an empty list `[]`.  
The `map` method first checks the type of `data` and sees it's a list.  
It then checks the length of `data`, which is 0.  
The code explicitly handles this case:  
```python
if len(data) == 0:
    return (0.0, [0.0])
```  
Thus, the method returns a tuple `(0.0, [0.0])`.  
In JSON output, this tuple is represented as an array where the first element is a float and the second is an array of floats: `[0.0, [0.0]]`.
