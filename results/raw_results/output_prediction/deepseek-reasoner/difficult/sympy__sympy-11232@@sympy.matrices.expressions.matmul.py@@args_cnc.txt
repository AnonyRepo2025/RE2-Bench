The function being called is `MatMul.args_cnc` with no additional arguments (since `args` and `kwargs` are empty). The method is defined as:

```python
def args_cnc(self, **kwargs):
    coeff, matrices = self.as_coeff_matrices()
    coeff_c, coeff_nc = coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)
    if coeff_c == [1]:
        coeff_c = []
    elif coeff_c == set([1]):
        coeff_c = set()
    return (coeff_c, coeff_nc + matrices)
```

1. **Call `self.as_coeff_matrices()`**:  
   This method separates scalar and matrix parts of the `MatMul` expression:
   - `scalars = [x for x in self.args if not x.is_Matrix]`
   - `matrices = [x for x in self.args if x.is_Matrix]`
   - `coeff = Mul(*scalars)` (product of scalars)

   Given `self` is empty (`{}`), `self.args` is not defined. However, in the context of the `AssocOp.__new__` constructor (which `MatMul` likely uses), if no arguments are provided, it returns the identity element. For `MatMul`, the identity is `1` (scalar) when there are no matrices. Thus:
   - `scalars = []` (no scalar args)
   - `matrices = []` (no matrix args)
   - `coeff = Mul()` â†’ `1` (empty product is 1)

2. **Call `coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)` on `coeff=1`**:  
   `1` is a `sympy.Integer`. Its `args_cnc` method (inherited from `Mul` or `Basic`) returns:
   - `coeff_c = [1]` (commutative part)
   - `coeff_nc = []` (non-commutative part)

3. **Adjust `coeff_c`**:  
   The code checks:
   ```python
   if coeff_c == [1]:
       coeff_c = []  # condition met, so set to empty list
   ```
   Thus, `coeff_c` becomes `[]`.

4. **Combine results**:  
   `return (coeff_c, coeff_nc + matrices) = ([], [] + []) = ([], [])`.

**Output**: The result is a tuple of two empty lists: `([], [])`.
