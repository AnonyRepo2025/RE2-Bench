[THOUGHT]
The function `_symbolic_factor_list` processes the expression "x + 4" as follows:
1. `expr` is sympified to the Add expression \(x + 4\).
2. `Mul.make_args(expr)` returns a tuple containing the single expression \((x + 4)\), since it's not a Mul.
3. For this argument:
   - It's not a Number, so skip coefficient multiplication.
   - It's not a Pow, so treat as base \(x + 4\) with exponent \(1\).
4. Attempt to convert base to a polynomial via `_poly_from_expr`:
   - Expansion is applied (default), but \(x + 4\) is already expanded.
   - Polynomial representation: \(\{(1,): 1, (0,): 4\}\) with generator \(x\).
   - Constructed Poly: \(x + 4\).
5. Call `factor_list()` on the Poly:
   - Returns \((1, [(x + 4, 1)])\), as \(x + 4\) is irreducible.
6. Since exponent is \(1\):
   - Extend factors with \([(x + 4, 1)]\).
7. Method is "factor" (not "sqf"), so no grouping by exponent.
8. Final output: \((1, [(x + 4, 1)])\).

The output is represented as a tuple with coefficient 1 and a list of factors. Each factor is a tuple (expression string, exponent). Thus:
- Coefficient: 1
- Factors: [["x + 4", 1]]
