The `fit` method in the `FeatureUnion` class is called with `X=None` and `y=None`. However, the `self` object provided in the input lacks the required `transformer_list` attribute, which is essential for `FeatureUnion` operations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State of `self`**:  
   The input `self` has attributes:  
   - `steps = null`  
   - `memory = null`  
   - `verbose = false`  

2. **Execution of `fit`**:  
   The `fit` method attempts to call `self._parallel_func(X, y, fit_params, _fit_one)`.  
   - `self._parallel_func` requires `self.transformer_list` (accessed via `list(self.transformer_list)`).  
   - Since `transformer_list` is **not defined** in `self`, this raises an `AttributeError`.  

3. **No State Change**:  
   The `AttributeError` occurs before any modifications to `self` (like updating `transformer_list` or other attributes). Thus, the state of `self` remains **unchanged**.  

4. **Output Structure**:  
   The output must reflect the final state of `self` with keys: `steps`, `memory`, and `verbose`. These values remain identical to the input since the method fails early.  

**Final Output**:  
```json
{
    "steps": null,
    "memory": null,
    "verbose": false
}
```
