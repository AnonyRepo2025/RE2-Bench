The function `split_super_sub` processes the input text "alpha^+_1" as follows:
1. Initialize: `pos=0`, `name=None`, `supers=[]`, `subs=[]`.
2. First segment (pos=0 to 5): 
   - Finds next break at index 5 (the '^' character).
   - Extracts "alpha" and sets `name="alpha"`.
3. Second segment (pos=5 to 7):
   - Finds next break at index 7 (the '_' character).
   - Extracts "^+", which starts with '^', so appends "+" to `supers`.
4. Third segment (pos=7 to 9):
   - No more breaks found, extracts "_1" to end.
   - Starts with '_', so appends "1" to `subs`.
5. After loop: 
   - Checks if `name` matches regex `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$` ("alpha" doesn't end with digits, so no match).
6. Returns: `("alpha", ["+"], ["1"])`.

The output is a tuple containing the base name, a list of superscripts, and a list of subscripts. In JSON, this is represented as an array: `["alpha", ["+"], ["1"]]`.
