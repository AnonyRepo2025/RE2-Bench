[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step:
1. The `format` method is called with `x = null` (Python `None`)
2. The method checks: `if x is not None`
3. Since `x` is `None`, this condition fails
4. The method executes the `else` branch: `return ''`
5. Therefore, the output is an empty string

The class attributes (NUMBER, NUMBER_TEEN, etc.) are irrelevant in this case because the input is `None`, so they don't affect the output.
