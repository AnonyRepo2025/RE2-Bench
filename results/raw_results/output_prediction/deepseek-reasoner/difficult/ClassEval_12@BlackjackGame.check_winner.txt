[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of the `check_winner` method step by step using the provided inputs:

1. **Calculate player hand value**:
   - Player hand: ["2S", "4S", "5S"]
   - "2S" → rank "2" → value 2
   - "4S" → rank "4" → value 4
   - "5S" → rank "5" → value 5
   - Total = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11
   - No aces → player_value = 11

2. **Calculate dealer hand value**:
   - Dealer hand: ["2S", "JS", "QS"]
   - "2S" → rank "2" → value 2
   - "JS" → rank "J" → value 10
   - "QS" → rank "Q" → value 10
   - Total = 2 + 10 + 10 = 22
   - No aces → dealer_value = 22

3. **Evaluate winner conditions**:
   - Condition 1: `if player_value > 21 and dealer_value > 21` → 11>21 is false → skip
   - Condition 2: `elif player_value > 21` → 11>21 false → skip
   - Condition 3: `elif dealer_value > 21` → 22>21 true → return "Player wins"

The dealer busts (value >21) while the player does not, so the player wins. The deck and instance variables are irrelevant since `check_winner` only uses the arguments passed to it.
