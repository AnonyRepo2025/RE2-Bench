[THOUGHT]
The method `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` is called with `feature_idx=2` and `drop_idx="1"`. The key condition in the method is:

```python
if not self._infrequent_enabled:
    return drop_idx
```

In the input, `self._infrequent_enabled` is `false`. This means the condition `not self._infrequent_enabled` evaluates to `True`, so the method immediately returns the input `drop_idx` without further processing. The other parameters (`_default_to_infrequent_mappings`, `_infrequent_indices`, etc.) are irrelevant here because the early return is triggered.

Thus, the output is the original `drop_idx` value, which is the string `"1"`.
