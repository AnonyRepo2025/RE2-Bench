[THOUGHT]
The function `_matrix_derivative(expr, x)` computes the derivative of a matrix expression `expr` with respect to `x`. Given the input:
- `expr` is a 2x2 matrix with `_mat: null` (indicating symbolic elements)
- `x` is the symbol "x"

Step-by-step execution:
1. Call `expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)`, which returns `[_LeftRightArgs([S.One, S.One], higher=self._eval_derivative(x))]`.
2. `self._eval_derivative(x)` computes the element-wise derivative of the matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, this results in a new 2x2 matrix where each element is the derivative of the original element w.r.t. `x`.
3. Since the original matrix has `_mat: null` (symbolic elements), the derivative matrix will also have symbolic derivatives of these elements, maintaining the same 2x2 structure.
4. The rank of the derivative is 2 (matrix dimensions), so it returns a matrix (not an `ArrayDerivative`).
5. The output is a new matrix with:
   - `_rows: 2` (same as input)
   - `_cols: 2` (same as input)
   - `_mat: null` (derivatives are symbolic, so elements remain unspecified)

Thus, the output matrix has identical dimensions to the input, with symbolic derivative elements.
