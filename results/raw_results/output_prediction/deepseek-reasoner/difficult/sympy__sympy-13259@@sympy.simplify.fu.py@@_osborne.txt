The function `_osborne(e, d)` is called with `e = "2*sinh(2)"` and no value for `d`. However, the function requires two arguments. Since `d` is not provided in the input, this would normally cause a `TypeError`. But to proceed with the transformation as per the function's logic, I'll assume `d=1` (a common default) and interpret the string `"2*sinh(2)"` as a SymPy expression.

1. **Convert input string to expression**:  
   `e = 2*sinh(2)` (a `Mul` node: `2 * sinh(2)`).

2. **Apply `bottom_up` traversal** with `d=1**:  
   - For the inner node `sinh(2)`:  
     - `rv = sinh(2)`, so `a = 2` (argument).  
     - Scale `a` by `d=1`: `a = 2 * 1 = 2`.  
     - Transform: `sinh(2) â†’ I * sin(2)`.  
   - For the outer node `2 * sinh(2)`:  
     - Replace `sinh(2)` with `I*sin(2)`: `2 * (I * sin(2)) = 2*I*sin(2)`.  

3. **Result**:  
   The transformed expression is `2*I*sin(2)`. Convert to string: `"2*I*sin(2)"`.

Thus, the output is the string representation of the transformed expression.
