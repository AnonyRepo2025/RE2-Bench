The function `_make_test_folds` in `StratifiedKFold` is responsible for creating test folds for stratified k-fold cross-validation. Given the input with `n_splits=5`, `shuffle=False`, `random_state=None`, and the provided `y` array of length 120, the steps are:

1. **Convert `y` to a numpy array**: The input `y` is parsed from the string representation to a list of integers and converted to a numpy array.
2. **Check target type**: The target type is determined to be 'multiclass' (since there are three classes: 0, 1, 2), which is allowed.
3. **Ensure `y` is 1D**: The array is already 1D, so it remains unchanged.
4. **Encode classes by first occurrence**:
   - Use `np.unique` to get unique classes, their first occurrence indices, and an inverse array.
   - Reorder classes based on the first occurrence: class 2 (first at index 0) becomes 0, class 1 (first at index 1) becomes 1, class 0 (first at index 3) becomes 2.
   - `y_encoded` is created by mapping original classes to these new labels.
5. **Count class frequencies**:
   - New class 0 (original class 2): 32 samples.
   - New class 1 (original class 1): 42 samples.
   - New class 2 (original class 0): 46 samples.
   - Minimum class count is 32, and since `n_splits=5` is not greater than any class count and is <= 32, no warning or error is raised.
6. **Sort `y_encoded`**: The array is sorted to group by class: 32 zeros, then 42 ones, then 46 twos.
7. **Compute allocation per fold and class**:
   - For each fold (0 to 4), count the number of samples per class in every 5th element of the sorted array.
   - Allocation matrix:
     - Fold 0: [7, 8, 9] (class 0, 1, 2)
     - Fold 1: [7, 8, 9]
     - Fold 2: [6, 9, 9]
     - Fold 3: [6, 9, 9]
     - Fold 4: [6, 8, 10]
8. **Assign test folds**:
   - For each class, create a fold vector by repeating the fold number according to the allocation counts.
   - Class 0 (new) fold vector: [0]×7 + [1]×7 + [2]×6 + [3]×6 + [4]×6.
   - Class 1 (new) fold vector: [0]×8 + [1]×8 + [2]×9 + [3]×9 + [4]×8.
   - Class 2 (new) fold vector: [0]×9 + [1]×9 + [2]×9 + [3]×9 + [4]×10.
   - Assign these vectors to the indices of each class in the original array (sorted by index).

The output is the `test_folds` array, which is a list of 120 integers representing the fold index (0 to 4) for each sample in the original order. The array is formatted as a space-separated string in brackets.
