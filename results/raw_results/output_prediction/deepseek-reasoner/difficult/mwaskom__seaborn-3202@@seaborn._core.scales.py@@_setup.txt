[THOUGHT]
The function `_setup` processes a `Nominal` scale instance. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Create a copy of `self`**: A new instance `new` is created as a copy of `self`. The original `self` has `values=null`, `order=null`, `_tick_params=null`, `_label_params=null`, and `_legend=null`.

2. **Set tick parameters**: Since `new._tick_params` is `null`, `new.tick()` is called. This method (not shown) sets `_tick_params` to a dictionary containing a locator. The exact locator type is unspecified in the provided code, but it's typically a `FixedLocator` for nominal scales.

3. **Set label parameters**: Since `new._label_params` is `null`, `new.label()` is called. This sets `_label_params` to a dictionary containing a formatter. For nominal scales, this is usually a `StrMethodFormatter` or similar.

4. **Process data**: 
   - `stringify` is a vectorized function that formats inputs as strings.
   - `units_seed = categorical_order(data, new.order)` extracts unique categories from `data`. Given the input `data` has no explicit values (only metadata like `_name="x"`), `units_seed` is an empty array.

5. **Create matplotlib scale**: 
   - A custom `CatScale` class is defined (subclass of `LinearScale`).
   - An instance `mpl_scale` is created with name `"x"` (from `data._name`).

6. **Set up axis**: 
   - Since no axis is provided, a `PseudoAxis` (not defined) is created.
   - The axis view interval is set to `(0, len(units_seed)-1) = (0, -1)` (since `units_seed` is empty).
   - `axis.update_units(stringify(np.array(units_seed)))` updates units with an empty string array.

7. **Define pipeline**:
   - `convert_units` maps input values to positions. For empty `units_seed`, it always returns `NaN`.
   - `prop.get_mapping(new, data)` returns a mapping function (details depend on `prop`, which has `variable="objectproperty"`).

8. **Set spacer**: `_spacer` is set to a function that always returns `1`.

9. **Legend handling**: `prop.legend` is not present in the input, so `_legend` remains `null`.

10. **Return attributes**:
    - `values` and `order` remain `null` (unchanged from input).
    - `_tick_params` and `_label_params` are now dictionaries (set by `tick()` and `label()`).
    - `_matplotlib_scale` is the `CatScale` instance (represented as `{}` in output structure).
    - `_pipeline` is a list of two functions: `convert_units` and the result of `prop.get_mapping()`.
    - `_spacer` is a function (represented as `{}` in output structure).

Given the input data has no values, `units_seed` is empty, and the pipeline functions handle this implicitly. The locator and formatter are set but their exact types are determined by the `tick()` and `label()` methods (not provided).
