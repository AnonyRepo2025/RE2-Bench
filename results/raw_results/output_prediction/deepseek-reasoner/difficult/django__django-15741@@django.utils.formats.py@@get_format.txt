[THOUGHT]
The function `get_format` is called with `format_type="jS \\o\\f F"` and `use_l10n=None`. 

1. Since `use_l10n` is `None`, the function checks `settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL`. Assuming default Django settings, `USE_L10N` is `True`, so `use_l10n` becomes `True`.
2. With `use_l10n=True` and no `lang` provided, `get_language()` is called. Assuming the default language is active (e.g., 'en'), it proceeds.
3. The function checks the cache for `(format_type, lang)`. Since no prior call is indicated, it misses the cache.
4. With `use_l10n=True`, it iterates through format modules for the language (e.g., `django.conf.locale.en.formats`). The format string "jS \\o\\f F" (which represents a date format like "1st of December") is not a standard key in these modules (standard keys are like `DATE_FORMAT`, `TIME_FORMAT`, etc.).
5. Since the format string is not found in any module, it checks if `format_type` is in `FORMAT_SETTINGS` (a predefined set of standard setting names). "jS \\o\\f F" is not in this set.
6. The function returns `format_type` directly as a fallback, which is the input string "jS \\o\\f F".
7. The result is cached and returned. The ISO input formats branch is skipped since the format type doesn't match.

Thus, the output is the original string "jS \\o\\f F".
