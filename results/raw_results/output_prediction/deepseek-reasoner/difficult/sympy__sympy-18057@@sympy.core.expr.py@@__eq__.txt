[THOUGHT]
The `__eq__` method in the `Expr` class is being called with `self` as an empty dictionary and `other` as the string "picoweber". The method first attempts to sympify `other` using `_sympify(other)`, which calls `sympify("picoweber", strict=True)`. Since "picoweber" is not a valid mathematical expression and cannot be sympified, this raises a `SympifyError`. The method catches this exception and returns `False` immediately. The subsequent checks (like `isinstance(other, Expr)`, `type(self) != type(other)`, etc.) are never reached because the method exits early after catching the exception. Therefore, the output is `False`.
