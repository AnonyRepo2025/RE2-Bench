The function `_mapping_repr` is called with:
- `mapping = {"foo": "bar"}`
- `title = "Attributes"`
- `summarizer = {}` (though this should be a callable, we'll proceed with the given input)
- `expand_option_name = "display_expand_attrs"`

Steps:
1. `col_width` is not provided, so calculate it via `_calculate_col_width(mapping)`. The keys are ["foo"], so max key length is 3. `col_width = max(3, 7) + 6 = 13`.
2. `max_rows` is not provided, so use `OPTIONS['display_max_rows']`. Since no value is given, assume the default is large enough (e.g., 50) so that 1 item doesn't exceed it.
3. Initialize `summary = ["Attributes:"]`.
4. Mapping is non-empty (length=1). Check expansion via `_get_boolean_with_default("display_expand_attrs", default=True)`. Without knowing `OPTIONS`, assume it returns `True` (default behavior).
5. Since expansion is enabled and length (1) â‰¤ max_rows (50), iterate over mapping items and apply `summarizer` for each. However, `summarizer` is an empty dict `{}`, which is not callable. This would cause a `TypeError` in real execution. But given the context, assume the intended summarizer would produce a string like `"    foo: bar"` for key "foo" and value "bar".
6. The summary becomes: `["Attributes:", "    foo: bar"]`.
7. Join with newline: `"Attributes:\n    foo: bar"`.

Given the constraints, the output is a string with the title and the key-value pair.
