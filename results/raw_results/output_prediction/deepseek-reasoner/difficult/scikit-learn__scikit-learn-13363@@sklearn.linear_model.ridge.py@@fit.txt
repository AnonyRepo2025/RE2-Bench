The `fit` method processes the input data and updates the model's coefficients (`coef_`), intercept (`intercept_`), and iteration count (`n_iter_`). Given the inputs:

- `X = [[-0.46341769, -0.46572975], [0.24196227, -1.91328024], [-1.72491783, -0.56228753]]`
- `y = [-1.01283112, 0.31424733, -0.90802408]`
- `sample_weight = 2.0`

The following steps occur:

1. **Data validation and preprocessing**:
   - `check_X_y` validates `X` and `y`, ensuring they are numeric and conform to requirements.
   - `sample_weight` is applied by rescaling `X` and `y` by `√2` (since all weights are 2.0).
   - With `fit_intercept=True`, the rescaled data is centered by subtracting feature means and target mean.

2. **Ridge regression solving**:
   - The solver is `'auto'`, which selects `'cholesky'` for dense data.
   - The centered and rescaled data is used to solve the ridge regression problem with `alpha=1.0`.
   - The system `(XᵀX + αI)w = Xᵀy` is solved directly, yielding coefficients `w = [0.1710, -0.4348]`.

3. **Intercept calculation**:
   - The intercept in the rescaled space is computed as `y_offset - (X_offset @ w)`, resulting in `0.0023`.
   - This intercept is stored as-is (in the rescaled space).

4. **Iteration count**:
   - The `'cholesky'` solver does not iterate, so `n_iter_` remains `null`.

The model's state is updated accordingly, with coefficients and intercept reflecting the solution to the weighted ridge regression problem.
