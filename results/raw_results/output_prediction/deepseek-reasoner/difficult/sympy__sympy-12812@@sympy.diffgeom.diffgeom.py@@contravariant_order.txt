[THOUGHT]
The function `contravariant_order` is called with `expr` as an empty dictionary `{}`. Since the input doesn't specify `_strict` in kwargs, it defaults to `False`. The function checks the type of `expr`:

1. `{}` is not an instance of `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `BaseVectorField`, or `TensorProduct`.
2. The condition `not _strict or expr.atoms(BaseScalarField)` is evaluated:
   - `not _strict` → `not False` → `True`
   - Since the first part is `True`, the second part (`expr.atoms(BaseScalarField)`) is not evaluated due to short-circuiting.
3. The condition is satisfied, so the function returns `0`.

The empty dictionary doesn't trigger any recursive processing or error conditions because the condition relying on `_strict` short-circuits to `True`.
