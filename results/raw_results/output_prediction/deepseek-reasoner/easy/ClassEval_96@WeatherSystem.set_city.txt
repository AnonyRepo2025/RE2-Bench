[THOUGHT]
The function `set_city` is defined to take a `city` argument and update the `self.city` attribute. It does not have a return statement, so by default, it returns `None`. Given the input:
- The current `self.city` is "New York"
- The argument `city` is "Beijing"

When `set_city` is called, it sets `self.city` to "Beijing". However, since the function doesn't return any value, the output of the function call is `None`. In JSON, `None` is represented as `null`.

Therefore, the output should be `null`.
