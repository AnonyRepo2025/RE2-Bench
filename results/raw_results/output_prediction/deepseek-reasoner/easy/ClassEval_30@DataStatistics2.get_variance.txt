[THOUGHT]
The input for `data` is given as a string: `"[1 2 3 4]"`. However, the `DataStatistics2` class expects numerical data for variance calculation. The `__init__` method converts the input to a NumPy array, but since the input is a string, it creates an array with a single string element. This causes `np.var()` to fail with a `TypeError` because variance is not defined for strings.

But the string `"[1 2 3 4]"` appears to represent a list of numbers. Given the context of computing variance, the intended input is likely the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. For this list:
- Mean = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 2.5
- Variance = [(1-2.5)² + (2-2.5)² + (3-2.5)² + (4-2.5)²] / 4 = (2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25
- Rounded to 2 decimal places: 1.25

Thus, the output is `1.25`.
