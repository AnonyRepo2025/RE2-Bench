[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step with the given inputs:
1. The function `f` is called with arguments `s = "@@@ff"` and `ch = "@"`.
2. `sl` is initialized to `s`, so `sl = "@@@ff"`.
3. Check if `ch` ("@") is in `s` ("@@@ff"): True, since "@" appears in the string.
4. Execute the if-block: `sl = s.lstrip(ch)`
   - `lstrip('@')` removes all leading "@" characters from the string.
   - For `"@@@ff"`, removing leading "@" results in `"ff"`.
5. Check if `len(sl)` is 0: `len("ff")` is 2 (not 0), so the inner if-block is skipped.
6. Return `sl`, which is `"ff"`.

Therefore, the output is `"ff"`.
