[THOUGHT]
The input for `data` is provided as a string: `"[ 0 -1 -3  2]"`. In the `__init__` method, `self.data = np.array(data)` creates a NumPy array from this string. Since the input is a single string (not a list of numbers), the resulting array has one element: the string `"[ 0 -1 -3  2]"`. 

When `get_min()` is called, `np.min(self.data)` computes the minimum value in this array. For a single-element array of strings, the minimum is the string itself because there are no other elements to compare. 

Therefore, the output is the original string `"[ 0 -1 -3  2]"`.
