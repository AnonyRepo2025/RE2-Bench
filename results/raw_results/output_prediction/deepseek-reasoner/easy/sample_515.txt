[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step with the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:

1. `result = array.copy()` creates a new list identical to the input:  
   result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2. `result.reverse()` reverses the list in-place:  
   result becomes [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

3. `result[:] = [item * 2 for item in result]` does two things:  
   - The list comprehension iterates over the current `result` ([5,4,3,2,1]) and doubles each element:  
     [5*2, 4*2, 3*2, 2*2, 1*2] â†’ [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]  
   - The slice assignment `[:]` replaces all elements of `result` with these new values  

4. The function returns the modified list: [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]

The output is a new list where:  
- Original order is reversed (5,4,3,2,1 becomes 1,2,3,4,5 reversed)  
- Each element is doubled
