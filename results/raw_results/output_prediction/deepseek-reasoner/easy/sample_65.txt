[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function execution step by step:

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `nums` = [3, 2, 0, 7] and `index` = 3.
2. The expression is: `nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2`
3. Evaluate the first part: `nums[index] % 42`
   - `nums[3]` is 7
   - `7 % 42` = 7 (since 7 is less than 42)
4. Evaluate the second part: `nums.pop(index) * 2`
   - `nums.pop(3)` removes and returns the element at index 3, which is 7
   - The list becomes [3, 2, 0]
   - `7 * 2` = 14
5. Add the results: 7 + 14 = 21
6. The function returns 21

The key points:
- The first term `nums[index]` is evaluated before `pop()` modifies the list
- `pop()` removes the element and returns it for the multiplication
- The list modification doesn't affect the first term since it's evaluated first
