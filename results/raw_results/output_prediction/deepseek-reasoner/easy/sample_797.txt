[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step:

1. The function `f` takes a dictionary `dct` as input. From the input JSON, `dct` is {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}.

2. Initialize an empty list `lst = []`.

3. `sorted(dct)` sorts the keys of the dictionary alphabetically. The keys are "a", "b", "c", which are already in sorted order → ["a", "b", "c"].

4. Iterate over each key in the sorted list:
   - For key "a": append tuple ("a", dct["a"]) → ("a", 1)
   - For key "b": append tuple ("b", dct["b"]) → ("b", 2)
   - For key "c": append tuple ("c", dct["c"]) → ("c", 3)

5. The list `lst` becomes [("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)].

6. Return this list. In JSON output, tuples are represented as arrays, so the output will be a list of lists: [["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]].

Therefore, the output should be a JSON array containing the key-value pairs in alphabetical order by key.
