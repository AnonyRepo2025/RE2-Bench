[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes two arguments: `array` and `list`. Here's the step-by-step execution:

1. **`array.extend(list)`**: This modifies `array` in-place by appending all elements from `list`.  
   - Initial `array`: `[2, 15, 15, 1]`  
   - `list`: `[15, 1]`  
   - After `extend`, `array` becomes: `[2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1]`  

2. **`[e for e in array if e % 2 == 0]`**:  
   - This creates a list of even numbers from `array` (only `2` qualifies), but the result isn't stored or used, so it has no effect.  

3. **`return [e for e in array if e >= 10]`**:  
   - Filters `array` for elements ≥ 10:  
     - `2` → skip (2 < 10)  
     - `15` → include  
     - `15` → include  
     - `1` → skip (1 < 10)  
     - `15` → include  
     - `1` → skip  
   - Result: `[15, 15, 15]`  

The function returns `[15, 15, 15]`.
