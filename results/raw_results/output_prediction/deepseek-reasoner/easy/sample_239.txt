We are given the function `f(text, froms)` which performs:
1. `text.lstrip(froms)`: Removes leading characters that are in the `froms` string.
2. `text.rstrip(froms)`: Removes trailing characters that are in the `froms` string.
3. Returns the modified text.

Input values:
- `text`: "0 t 1cos " (note the trailing space)
- `froms`: "st 0\t\n  " (characters: 's', 't', ' ', '0', tab, newline, and two spaces)

Step-by-step execution:

1. **Apply `lstrip(froms)`**:
   - The `froms` characters are: 's', 't', ' ', '0', '\t', '\n'
   - Leading characters in "0 t 1cos ":
     - '0' is in `froms` → remove → remaining: " t 1cos "
     - ' ' (space) is in `froms` → remove → remaining: "t 1cos "
     - 't' is in `froms` → remove → remaining: " 1cos "
     - ' ' (space) is in `froms` → remove → remaining: "1cos "
   - Result after `lstrip`: "1cos " (trailing space preserved)

2. **Apply `rstrip(froms)`** to "1cos ":
   - Trailing characters:
     - ' ' (space) is in `froms` → remove → remaining: "1cos"
     - 's' is in `froms` → remove → remaining: "1co"
     - 'o' is **not** in `froms` → stop
   - Result after `rstrip`: "1co"

Final output: "1co"
