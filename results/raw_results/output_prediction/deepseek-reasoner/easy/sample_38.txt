[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a string and applies two operations:
1. `string.title()`: This converts the first character of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase. Words are separated by whitespace. For the input "1oE-err bzz-bmm":
   - The first word "1oE-err":
     - The first alphabetic character is 'o' at index 1, which becomes 'O'.
     - The rest of the word ("E-err") is converted to lowercase: 'E' becomes 'e', and the rest remains lowercase, resulting in "e-err".
     - Combined: "1Oe-err".
   - The second word "bzz-bmm":
     - The first character 'b' becomes 'B'.
     - The rest ("zz-bmm") is already lowercase, so it remains "zz-bmm".
     - Combined: "Bzz-bmm".
   - After `title()`, the string is "1Oe-err Bzz-bmm".

2. `.replace(' ', '')`: This removes all spaces. The string becomes "1Oe-errBzz-bmm".

Thus, the final output is "1Oe-errBzz-bmm".
