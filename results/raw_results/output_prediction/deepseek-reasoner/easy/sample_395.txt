[THOUGHT]
The function `f(s)` processes the input string `s` character by character:
1. It iterates over each character in the string using index `i`.
2. For each character at position `i`:
   - If the character is a decimal digit (`s[i].isdecimal()` is True), it returns `i + (1 if s[i] is '0' else 0)`.
   - Else if the character is '0' (though this case is unreachable since '0' is a digit and caught by the first condition), it would return -1.
3. If no digit is found after checking all characters, it returns -1.

For input `s = "11"`:
- At index 0: `s[0] = '1'` is a decimal digit.
- Since `'1' != '0'`, the expression `(s[i] == '0')` evaluates to 0.
- Therefore, the return value is `0 + 0 = 0`.

The loop terminates immediately after processing the first character, so the output is 0.
