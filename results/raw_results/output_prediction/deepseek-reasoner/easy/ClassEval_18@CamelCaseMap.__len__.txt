[THOUGHT]
The task is to determine the output of the `__len__` method for the given CamelCaseMap instance.
- The input shows that `self._data` is a dictionary: `{"firstName": "John"}`
- The `__len__` method is defined as `return len(self._data)`
- The dictionary has 1 key-value pair ("firstName" and "John")
- Therefore, the length is 1
