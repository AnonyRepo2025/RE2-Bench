[THOUGHT]
The `check_in` method is called with:
- `room_type`: "single"
- `room_number`: 2
- `name`: "guest 1"

The current state of `self.booked_rooms` is `{"single": {}}` (an empty dictionary for "single" rooms).

1. **First condition**: Check if `room_type` ("single") is in `self.booked_rooms.keys()`. Since `"single"` is a key, the condition fails (returns `False`), so we proceed.

2. **Second condition**: Check if `name` ("guest 1") is in `self.booked_rooms[room_type]` (which is `self.booked_rooms["single"]`). The dictionary for "single" is empty, so "guest 1" is not present. This condition fails, and the code block under it is skipped.

3. **No further code**: The method has no other logic or return statements. Since none of the conditions are met, the method completes without returning any value, resulting in `None`.

Thus, the output is `None` (represented as `null` in JSON).
