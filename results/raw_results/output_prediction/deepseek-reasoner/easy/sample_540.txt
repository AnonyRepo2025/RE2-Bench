The function `f(a)` processes a list `a` as follows:
1. It creates a copy of the input list `a` called `b`.
2. It iterates over the indices of `b` with `k` starting from 0, stepping by 2, up to `len(a)-2` (since the range is `range(0, len(a)-1, 2)`).
3. For each `k`, it inserts the value at `b[k]` at position `k+1` in the list `b`.
4. After the loop, it appends the first element of `b` (i.e., `b[0]`) to the end of `b`.

Given input `a = [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`:
- Initial `b = [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`.
- Loop for `k` in `[0, 2, 4]` (since `len(a)-1 = 5`, step=2):
  - At `k=0`: Insert `b[0]` (5) at index 1 → `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`.
  - At `k=2`: Insert `b[2]` (5) at index 3 → `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`.
  - At `k=4`: Insert `b[4]` (5) at index 5 → `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`.
- Append `b[0]` (5) → `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9, 5]`.

Thus, the output is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9, 5]`.
