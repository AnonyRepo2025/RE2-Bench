[THOUGHT]
The function `triangle_area` calculates the area of a triangle using the formula: area = (base * height) / 2.  
Given inputs:  
- `a` (base) = 10  
- `h` (height) = 8  

Calculation:  
1. Multiply base `a` by height `h`: 10 * 8 = 80  
2. Divide by 2.0: 80 / 2.0 = 40.0  

The result is a float value because of the division by 2.0.
