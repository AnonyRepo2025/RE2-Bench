[THOUGHT]
The `median` function calculates the median of a list of numbers. Here's the step-by-step process for the input data [2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8]:
1. First, sort the data: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
2. The list has 7 elements (odd length), so the median is the middle element at index 3 (since n//2 = 7//2 = 3 in 0-based indexing)
3. The element at index 3 is 5
4. Since the length is odd, the function returns the middle element directly without rounding (rounding only applies to even-length lists)
5. Final output is 5
