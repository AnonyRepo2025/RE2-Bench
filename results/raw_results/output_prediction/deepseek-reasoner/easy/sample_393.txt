[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` processes the input string as follows:
1. Reverse the input string: `text = "scala"` becomes `ls = "alacs"`.
2. Initialize an empty string `text2`.
3. Loop over indices starting from `len(ls) - 3 = 2` down to (but not including) `0`, in steps of `-3`. For `"alacs"` (length 5), the only index is `i = 2`.
4. For `i = 2`, take the slice `ls[2:5]` which is `"acs"` (characters at indices 2, 3, 4: `'a'`, `'c'`, `'s'`).
5. Join these characters with `'---'` to form `"a---c---s"`, then append `'---'` to get `"a---c---s---"`.
6. After the loop, remove the last three characters (the trailing `'---'`) by slicing `text2[:-3]`, resulting in `"a---c---s"`.
7. Return this as the output.

Thus, for input `"scala"`, the output is `"a---c---s"`.
