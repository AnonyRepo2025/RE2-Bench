[THOUGHT]
The `list_employees` method processes the `employees` dictionary in the class instance. Given the input:
- `self.employees` contains one employee with ID "1" and details: 
  `{"name": "John", "position": "Manager", "department": "Sales", "salary": 100000}`

Steps:
1. Initialize `employee_data = {}`.
2. Since `self.employees` is non-empty, iterate over its items:
   - `employee_id = "1"`
   - `employee_info = {"name": "John", "position": "Manager", "department": "Sales", "salary": 100000}`
3. Create `employee_details` dictionary:
   - Add `'employee_ID': "1"`
   - Iterate over `employee_info` keys:
     - `'name' → 'John'`
     - `'position' → 'Manager'`
     - `'department' → 'Sales'`
     - `'salary' → 100000`
4. Set `employee_data["1"] = employee_details`.

The output will be a dictionary with key "1" containing the employee details including the added `employee_ID` field.
