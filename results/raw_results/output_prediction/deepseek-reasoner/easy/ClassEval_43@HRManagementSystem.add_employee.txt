[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of `add_employee` step by step:
1. The method receives `employee_id=1` and checks if it exists in `self.employees`
2. `self.employees` already contains key "1" (with employee data)
3. Since the ID exists, the method returns `False` (indicating the employee was not added)
4. The employee data is not modified or overwritten
