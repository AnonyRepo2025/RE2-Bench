[THOUGHT]
The function `eat` takes three arguments: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. It checks if `need` is less than or equal to `remaining`. If true, it returns a list with `number + need` and `remaining - need`. Otherwise, it returns `[number + remaining, 0]`.

Given inputs:
- `number = 4`
- `need = 8`
- `remaining = 9`

Step-by-step execution:
1. Check condition: `need <= remaining` → `8 <= 9` is `True`.
2. Since condition is true, compute:
   - `number + need` → `4 + 8 = 12`
   - `remaining - need` → `9 - 8 = 1`
3. Return `[12, 1]`.

Thus, the output is the list `[12, 1]`.
