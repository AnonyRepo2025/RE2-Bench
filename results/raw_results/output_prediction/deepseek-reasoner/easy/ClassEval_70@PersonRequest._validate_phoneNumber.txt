[THOUGHT]
1. The input to `_validate_phoneNumber` is `phoneNumber = "jgdjrj"`.
2. The method first checks if `phoneNumber` is empty: `"jgdjrj"` is not empty, so it proceeds.
3. Next, it checks if the length is 11 and if all characters are digits: 
   - Length of `"jgdjrj"` is 6 (not 11).
   - The string contains letters (`'j'`, `'g'`, `'d'`, `'r'`), so it fails `isdigit()`.
4. Since both conditions fail, the method returns `None`.
