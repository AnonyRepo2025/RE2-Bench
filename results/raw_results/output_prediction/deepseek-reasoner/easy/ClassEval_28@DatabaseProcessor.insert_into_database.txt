[THOUGHT]
The `insert_into_database` method performs database operations but doesn't return any value. Let's analyze:
1. It connects to "test.db" and creates a cursor
2. For each item in the data list:
   - For {"name": "John", "age": 25}: Executes `INSERT INTO test_table (name, age) VALUES ('John', 25)`
   - For {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}: Executes `INSERT INTO test_table (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 30)`
3. Commits changes and closes connection
4. The method has no return statement, so it implicitly returns `None`

Since there's no return value, the output should be `null` in JSON format.
