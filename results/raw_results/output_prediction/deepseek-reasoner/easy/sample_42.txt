[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input. Here's the step-by-step execution:
1. `nums.clear()` removes all elements from the list. Since the input `nums` is `[]` (empty list), it remains `[]`.
2. The loop `for num in nums:` iterates over the list. Since the list is empty, the loop body `nums.append(num * 2)` is never executed.
3. The function returns `nums`, which is still an empty list `[]`.

Thus, the output is an empty list.
