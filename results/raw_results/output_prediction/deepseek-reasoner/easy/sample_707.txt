[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step with the given inputs:
1. The input text is "undbs l" and position is 1.
2. Calculate length: len("undbs l") = 7 (characters: 'u','n','d','b','s',' ','l').
3. Compute index: position % (length + 1) = 1 % (7 + 1) = 1 % 8 = 1.
4. Check conditions: position (1) is not < 0, and index (1) is not < 0, so index remains 1.
5. Convert text to list: ['u','n','d','b','s',' ','l'].
6. Pop element at index 1: removes 'n', leaving ['u','d','b','s',' ','l'].
7. Join the list back into a string: "udbs l".
