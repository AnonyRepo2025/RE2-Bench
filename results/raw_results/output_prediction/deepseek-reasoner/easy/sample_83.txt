[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function `f(text)` step by step with the input `text = "qq0tt"`.

1. **Call `text.rpartition('0')`:**
   - `rpartition('0')` splits the string at the last occurrence of '0' and returns a tuple `(before, separator, after)`.
   - In `"qq0tt"`, the last '0' is at index 2 (0-based). 
   - The part before the last '0' is `"qq"`, the separator is `"0"`, and the part after is `"tt"`.
   - So, `l = ("qq", "0", "tt")`.

2. **Check if `l[2]` is empty:**
   - `l[2]` is `"tt"`, which is not empty. Therefore, we proceed to the return statement.

3. **Construct the return value:**
   - `len(l[0])` is the length of `"qq"`, which is `2`.
   - `l[2].find('0')` searches for '0' in `"tt"`. Since '0' is not found, it returns `-1`.
   - Add 1 to the result: `-1 + 1 = 0`.
   - Format the result as a string: `f"{2}:{0}"` â†’ `"2:0"`.

**Conclusion:** The function returns `"2:0"`.
