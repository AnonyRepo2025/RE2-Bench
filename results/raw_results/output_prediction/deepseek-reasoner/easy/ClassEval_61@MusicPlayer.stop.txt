[THOUGHT]
The `stop` method in the MusicPlayer class checks if `self.current_song` is not None. If it is not None, it sets `self.current_song` to None and returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 

Given the input state:
- `self.current_song` is "song1" (a non-None value)
- Therefore, the method will set `self.current_song` to None and return True.

The output is solely the return value of the method, which is True. The state changes to `self.current_song = None` are not part of the output.
