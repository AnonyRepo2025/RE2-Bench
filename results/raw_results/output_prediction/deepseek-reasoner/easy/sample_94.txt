[THOUGHT]
The function `f(a, b)` merges two dictionaries using `{**a, **b}`. This syntax unpacks both dictionaries into a new dictionary. If there are overlapping keys, values from `b` overwrite those from `a`.

Given inputs:
- `a = {"w": 5, "wi": 10}`
- `b = {"w": 3}`

Step-by-step execution:
1. Start with dictionary `a`: `{"w": 5, "wi": 10}`
2. Unpack dictionary `b` on top of `a`: 
   - Key `"w"` exists in both, so `b`'s value (`3`) overwrites `a`'s value (`5`)
   - Key `"wi"` only exists in `a`, so it remains `10`
3. Resulting merged dictionary: `{"w": 3, "wi": 10}`

The output structure requires keys `"w"` and `"wi"` with their respective values.
