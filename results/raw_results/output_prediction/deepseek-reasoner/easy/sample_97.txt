[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step with the given input:
1. The input `lst` is an empty list: `[]`.
2. The first operation is `lst.clear()`. Since the list is already empty, this operation leaves `lst` as `[]`.
3. Next, the function enters a for-loop: `for i in lst:`. Since `lst` is empty, the loop body (which checks `if i == 3`) never executes.
4. Because the loop didn't execute (and didn't break), the `else` clause associated with the for-loop triggers. This clause returns `True`.
5. Therefore, the function returns `True`.

The key points:
- `lst.clear()` on an empty list has no effect
- The for-loop iterates 0 times since the list is empty
- The loop's `else` clause executes when loops complete normally (without break)
- No element is ever checked against `3` because the list is empty
