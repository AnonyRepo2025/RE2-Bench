[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `chars`. The input `text` is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2" and `chars` is "0123456789-". 

1. Since `chars` is non-empty, the function executes `text = text.rstrip(chars)`. This removes all trailing characters in `chars` (digits 0-9 and hyphen) from the end of `text`.
2. The original text ends with "2.2". The last character '2' is in `chars`, so it is removed. The new last character is '.' (not in `chars`), so stripping stops.
3. The resulting text is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.".
4. The text is not empty, so the function returns "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.".
