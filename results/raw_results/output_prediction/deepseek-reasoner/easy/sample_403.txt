The function `f` counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring `part` in `full`, but with a specific behavior: after each occurrence is found, it removes the found substring and all characters before it, then continues searching in the remaining string.

Given:
- `full = "hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy"`
- `part = "hr"` (length=2)

Step-by-step execution:
1. First search: `full.find("hr")` returns index 0 (found at start). 
   - Update `full = full[0+2:] = "siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy"`
   - `count = 1`
2. Second search: In `"siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy"`, `find("hr")` returns index 10 (substring "hr" at positions 10-11). 
   - Update `full = full[10+2:] = "uejfhbrisvlmmy"`
   - `count = 2`
3. Third search: In `"uejfhbrisvlmmy"`, `find("hr")` returns -1 (no "hr" present). 
   - Loop exits.

Total occurrences: 2. The function returns `count = 2`.
