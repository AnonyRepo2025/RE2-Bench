[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step:
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `suffix`.
2. The input values are:
   - `text = "mathematics"`
   - `suffix = "example"`
3. The condition checks:
   - `suffix` is non-empty (True, since "example" is not empty)
   - `text.endswith(suffix)` checks if "mathematics" ends with "example"
4. "mathematics" does not end with "example" (it ends with "ics"), so the condition fails.
5. Therefore, the function returns the original `text` ("mathematics").
