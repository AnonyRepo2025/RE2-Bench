[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` checks two conditions:
1. If the input text is exactly '42.42', return True.
2. Otherwise, iterate over indices from 3 to len(text)-4 (inclusive). For each index i:
   - Check if the character at position i is '.'.
   - Check if the substring from index i-3 to the end consists only of digits.
   - Check if the substring from the start to index i (exclusive) consists only of digits.
   - If all conditions are met, return True.
If neither condition is satisfied, return False.

Given input text = "123E-10":
- Length is 7, so the loop runs for i in range(3, 7-3) → range(3,4) → only i=3.
- At i=3: 
  - text[3] = 'E' (not '.'), so condition fails.
- No other indices to check.
- Text is not '42.42', so return False.
