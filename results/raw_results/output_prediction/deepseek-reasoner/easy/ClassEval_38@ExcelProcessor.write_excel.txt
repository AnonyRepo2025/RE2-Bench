[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of `write_excel` step by step:
1. The method is called with:
   - `data`: A list of 4 rows, each containing 4 elements (strings and integers)
   - `file_name`: "test_data_process.xlsx"
2. Inside `write_excel`:
   - A new Excel workbook is created using `openpyxl.Workbook()`
   - The active sheet is selected
   - Each row from `data` is appended to the sheet:
     - Row 1: ["Name", "Age", "Country", "AGE"]
     - Row 2: ["John", 25, "USA", 25]
     - Row 3: ["Alice", 30, "Canada", 30]
     - Row 4: ["Bob", 35, "Australia", 35]
   - The workbook is saved to "test_data_process.xlsx"
   - The workbook is closed
3. Since all operations complete without errors:
   - The `try` block executes successfully
   - The method returns `1` (success indicator)

No exceptions occur because:
- The data structure is valid (list of lists with consistent column counts)
- The file name is valid
- There are no permission issues or disk space constraints mentioned
- All data types (strings and integers) are supported by openpyxl

Therefore, the output will be `1`.
