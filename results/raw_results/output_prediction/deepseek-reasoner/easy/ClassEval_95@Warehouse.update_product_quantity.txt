[THOUGHT]
The `update_product_quantity` method updates the inventory only if the `product_id` exists in `self.inventory`. Here, `product_id` is provided as an integer `1`, but the inventory key is a string `"1"`. Since integer `1` and string `"1"` are different in Python, the condition `if product_id in self.inventory` evaluates to `False`. Thus, no update occurs, and the method returns `None` as there is no explicit return statement.
