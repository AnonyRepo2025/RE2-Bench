[THOUGHT]
The function `f` processes the input text as follows:
1. First, it checks if the stripped text is empty. The input text "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris" is not empty after stripping, so it proceeds.
2. The text is split into three parts:
   - `head`: first character ("2")
   - `tail`: last character ("s")
   - `mid`: substring from index 1 to the second last character ("xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri")
3. Each part is processed by replacing all occurrences of `n` ("x") with `m` ("$"):
   - `head.replace("x", "$")` → "2" (no change)
   - `mid.replace("x", "$")` → replaces the "x" at the start with "$", resulting in "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri"
   - `tail.replace("x", "$")` → "s" (no change)
4. The processed parts are concatenated: "2" + "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri" + "s" = "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"

The output is the resulting string after replacement and concatenation.
