[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text, char)` uses the string method `rindex()` to find the last occurrence of the substring `char` in `text`. 

Given:
- `text = "breakfast"`
- `char = "e"`

Step-by-step:
1. The string "breakfast" has the character 'e' at index position 2 (indices: b=0, r=1, e=2, a=3, k=4, f=5, a=6, s=7, t=8).
2. `rindex()` returns the highest index where `char` is found. Since 'e' appears only once at index 2, this is the result.
3. No error occurs because 'e' exists in the string.

Thus, the output is `2`.
