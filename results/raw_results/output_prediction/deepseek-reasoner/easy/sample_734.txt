[THOUGHT]
The function `f` processes a list `nums` by iterating backwards from the second-to-last element to the first element. For each element at index `i`, if the element is even, it removes that element from the list. The iteration starts at index `len(nums)-2` and decrements down to index 0.

Given input: `nums = [5, 3, 3, 7]`

Step-by-step execution:
1. The list has 4 elements, so `len(nums)-2 = 2`. The loop runs for indices: 2, 1, 0.
2. Index 2: Element is 3 (odd) → no removal.
3. Index 1: Element is 3 (odd) → no removal.
4. Index 0: Element is 5 (odd) → no removal.
5. The list remains unchanged as `[5, 3, 3, 7]`.

Since no elements are even, nothing is removed. The function returns the original list.
