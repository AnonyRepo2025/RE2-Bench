[THOUGHT]
1. The method `read_file_as_json` is called on an instance of `TextFileProcessor` with `file_path` set to "test_2.txt".
2. The function opens "test_2.txt" in read mode (`'r'`).
3. It uses `json.load(file)` to parse the file's content as JSON.
4. Since the file content is not provided in the input, we must assume the file exists and contains valid JSON.
5. Without specific content, we cannot determine the exact output structure. However, the function will return the parsed JSON object from the file.
6. For the purpose of this simulation, we assume "test_2.txt" contains a valid JSON object (e.g., an empty object `{}` as a minimal example).
7. Therefore, the function returns an empty dictionary `{}`.
