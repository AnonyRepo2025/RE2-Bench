[THOUGHT]
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `list` (a list of integers) and `operation` (a lambda function).
2. It starts by creating a shallow copy of `list` called `new_list` using slicing (`list[:]`). The original list remains `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
3. `new_list.sort()` sorts the copy in ascending order, making `new_list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`.
4. The `operation` is applied to `new_list`. Since the operation is only given the copy (not the original list), and integers are immutable, any changes to `new_list` do not affect the original list. The lambda's specific behavior is irrelevant here because:
   - The original list is not passed to the operation.
   - The function returns the original list, not the modified copy.
5. The return value is the original, unmodified list: `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
