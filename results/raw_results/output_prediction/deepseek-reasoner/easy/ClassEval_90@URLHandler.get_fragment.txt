[THOUGHT]
The `get_fragment` method extracts the fragment part of a URL (the portion after the `#` symbol). For the input URL `"https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#aaa"`:
1. The `#` symbol is found at index 38 (0-based indexing).
2. The substring starting from index 39 (i.e., `fragment_start + 1`) to the end of the string is `"aaa"`.
3. Since `#` exists, the method returns `"aaa"`.

{
    "output": "aaa"
