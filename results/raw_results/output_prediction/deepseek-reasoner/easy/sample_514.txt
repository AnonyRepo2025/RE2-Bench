[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` processes the input text as follows:
1. Split the input text by whitespace into tokens. For the input "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-", splitting by space gives two tokens: ['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-'].
2. For each token, replace occurrences of "-{token}" and "{token}-" with a space. However:
   - For token '-stew---corn-and-beans-in':
     - Pattern "-" + token = "--stew---corn-and-beans-in" is not found in the text (text starts with single dash).
     - Pattern token + "-" = "-stew---corn-and-beans-in-" is not found (token followed by space, not dash).
   - For token 'soup-.-':
     - Pattern "-" + token = "-soup-.-" is not found (token preceded by space, not dash).
     - Pattern token + "-" = "soup-.--" is not found (token ends with dash, but no extra dash follows).
   No replacements occur during the loop.
3. After the loop, apply `text.strip('-')` to remove leading and trailing dashes:
   - Leading: Remove the first '-' from "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-" → "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-".
   - Trailing: Remove the last '-' from "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-" → "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-." (stops at '.' which is not a dash).
The final output is "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.".
