[THOUGHT]
The `remove_employee` method checks if the given `employee_id` exists in the `self.employees` dictionary. The current state of `self.employees` has one employee with the key `"1"` (a string). The input `employee_id` is `2` (an integer). Since dictionary keys are type-sensitive, the integer `2` does not match the string key `"1"`. Therefore, the condition `if employee_id in self.employees` evaluates to `False`, and the method returns `False`.
