The input provided in JSON is `"input": "\"294702567 726956429\""`. After parsing the JSON, the actual input string is `"294702567 726956429"` (including the double quotes). However, the code expects two space-separated numbers without quotes. 

Step-by-step execution:
1. `input().split()` splits the string `"294702567 726956429"` (with quotes) into two parts: 
   - `a = '"294702567'` (starts with a double quote)
   - `b = '726956429"'` (ends with a double quote)
2. `b = int(b[::-1])` reverses `b` to `'"924659627'` and tries to convert it to an integer. The double quote (`"`) makes this conversion invalid, causing a `ValueError`.

However, given the context of the problem and the first example (where input was provided without quotes), it's likely the intended input is `294702567 726956429` (without quotes). Using this interpretation:
1. `input().split()` yields `a = '294702567'`, `b = '726956429'`.
2. `b = int(b[::-1])` reverses `b` to `'924659627'` and converts to `924659627`.
3. `int(a) + b` = `294702567 + 924659627 = 1219362194`.

Thus, the output is `1219362194`.
