[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of the `add` function step by step with the given input list `[4, 4, 6, 8]`:

1. The function uses a list comprehension: `[lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0]`
2. First, determine the range of indices:
   - `len(lst) = 4`
   - `range(1, 4, 2)` generates indices: 1 and 3 (since it starts at 1, steps by 2, and stops before 4)
3. Process each index:
   - Index 1: `lst[1] = 4`
     - Check if even: `4 % 2 == 0` → True → include
   - Index 3: `lst[3] = 8`
     - Check if even: `8 % 2 == 0` → True → include
4. The resulting list is `[4, 8]`
5. Compute the sum: `4 + 8 = 12`
6. The function returns this sum: `12`

Note: Elements at index 0 (4) and index 2 (6) are skipped because:
- Index 0 is not in the range (starts at 1)
- Index 2 is not generated by `range(1, 4, 2)` (next index after 1 is 3)
