[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list `items` and a target value `target`. It checks if `target` is present in `items`. If found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `items`. If not found, it returns `-1`.

Given:
- `items = ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]`
- `target = "**"`

Step-by-step execution:
1. Check if `"**"` is in `items`: 
   - The list contains `"**"` at index 3.
2. Since `target` is found, return `items.index("**")`:
   - The first occurrence of `"**"` is at index 3.
3. Therefore, the function returns `3`.

The output should be the integer `3`.
