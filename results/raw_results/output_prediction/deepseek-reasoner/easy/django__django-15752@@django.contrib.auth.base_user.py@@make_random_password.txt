[THOUGHT]
The function `make_random_password` is called with default parameters since no arguments are provided in the input. The default `length` is 10, and `allowed_chars` is 'abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789'. The function generates a random string of the specified length using characters from `allowed_chars`. Since the output is random, any 10-character string composed of these characters is valid. For example, "k5FgH2R9vY" meets the criteria.
