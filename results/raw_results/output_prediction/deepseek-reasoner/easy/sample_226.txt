[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list `nums` and iterates over each index in the original list. For each element at index `i`, if the element is divisible by 3 (i.e., `nums[i] % 3 == 0`), it appends that element to the end of the list. 

Given the input `nums = [1, 3, 3]`:
1. **Initial list**: `[1, 3, 3]`
2. **Iteration 1 (i=0)**: 
   - `nums[0] = 1` → `1 % 3 = 1` (not divisible by 3) → no change.  
   - List remains `[1, 3, 3]`.
3. **Iteration 2 (i=1)**: 
   - `nums[1] = 3` → `3 % 3 = 0` (divisible by 3) → append `3`.  
   - List becomes `[1, 3, 3, 3]`.
4. **Iteration 3 (i=2)**: 
   - `nums[2] = 3` (original third element) → `3 % 3 = 0` → append `3`.  
   - List becomes `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.

The loop runs only for the original indices (`i=0,1,2`), so it stops after 3 iterations. The final returned list is `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
