[THOUGHT]
The function `f(s)` performs two string replacements in sequence:
1. First, it replaces all occurrences of 'a' with an empty string (removing them)
2. Then, it replaces all occurrences of 'r' with an empty string (removing them)

Given input string: `s = "rpaar"`
- Step 1: Remove all 'a' characters:
  - Original: "r p a a r" → After removing 'a's: "r p r" (the two 'a's are removed)
- Step 2: Remove all 'r' characters from "rpr":
  - "r p r" → After removing 'r's: "p" (the first and last characters 'r' are removed)

Final output is the string "p".
