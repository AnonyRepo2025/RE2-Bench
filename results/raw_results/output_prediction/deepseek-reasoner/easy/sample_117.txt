[THOUGHT]
The function `f` iterates over each index in the input string `numbers`. For each index `i`, it checks if the count of the character '3' in the entire string is greater than 1. If this condition is true at any point, it immediately returns the current index `i`. If the loop completes without the condition ever being true, it returns -1.

Given the input string "23157":
- The character '3' appears only once (at index 1).
- Therefore, `numbers.count('3')` is 1 at every iteration.
- The condition `numbers.count('3') > 1` is always false.
- The loop runs for all indices (0 to 4) without the condition being met.
- The function returns -1.
