[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` uses the string method `ljust()`. This method left-justifies the string in a field of a given width by padding it with a specified character (default is space). Here, the width is set to `len(text) + 1`, and the padding character is `#`. 

Given the input text is `"the cow goes moo"`:
1. Calculate the length of the text: `len("the cow goes moo")` is 15 (including spaces).
2. The width for `ljust()` is `15 + 1 = 16`.
3. Since the original string is 15 characters, `ljust(16, '#')` adds one `#` to the right to make the total length 16.
4. The result is `"the cow goes moo#"`.

Thus, the output string will be the original text followed by one `#` character.
