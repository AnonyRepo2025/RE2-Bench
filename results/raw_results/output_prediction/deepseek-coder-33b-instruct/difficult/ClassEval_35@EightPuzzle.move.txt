1. The initial state is [[1, 2, 3], [0, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]] and the goal state is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]].
2. The state to be moved is [[1, 6, 2], [7, 8, 0], [4, 5, 3]] and the direction is "left".
3. The blank space is at (1, 0) in the initial state and at (1, 1) in the state to be moved.
4. The blank space in the initial state can move to the left, but not to the right, up or down.
5. The blank space in the state to be moved can move to the right, but not to the left, up or down.
6. Therefore, the output of `move` will be the same as the input state, because the blank space in the state to be moved can't move to the left.
