1. Inside `to_python`, the value is first converted to a string using the `super().to_python(value)`.
2. If the value is not empty, it is split into its components using `urlsplit(value)`.
3. If the scheme is not present, it is assumed to be "https".
4. If the netloc is not present, it is assumed to be the same as the path.
5. The components are then joined back into a URL using `urlunsplit(url_fields)`.
