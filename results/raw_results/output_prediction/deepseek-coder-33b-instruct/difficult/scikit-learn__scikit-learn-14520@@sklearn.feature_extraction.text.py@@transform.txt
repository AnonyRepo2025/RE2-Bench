1. The `transform` method is called with `raw_documents` as null.
2. The `transform` method checks if the `vocabulary_` attribute is set. It is, so it continues.
3. The `transform` method checks if the `vocabulary_` attribute is empty. It is not, so it continues.
4. The `transform` method calls the `_count_vocab` method with `raw_documents` as null and `fixed_vocab` as true.
5. The `_count_vocab` method initializes an empty `vocabulary` dictionary.
6. The `_count_vocab` method calls the `build_analyzer` method to get the `analyze` function.
7. The `build_analyzer` method returns a partial function that calls the `_analyze` function with `analyzer` as `None`.
8. The `_analyze` function checks if `doc` is a string. It is not, so it continues.
9. The `_analyze` function checks if `analyzer` is `None`. It is not, so it continues.
10. The `_analyze` function checks if `preprocessor` is `None`. It is, so it continues.
11. The `_analyze` function checks if `tokenizer` is `None`. It is not, so it continues.
12. The `_analyze` function checks if `ngrams` is `None`. It is not, so it continues.
13. The `_analyze` function calls the `_word_ngrams` method with `tokens` as `doc` and `stop_words` as `None`.
14. The `_word_ngrams` method returns `doc` as it is.
15. The `_analyze` function returns `doc`.
16. The `_count_vocab` method initializes `j_indices`, `indptr`, and `values` as empty lists.
17. The `_count_vocab` method iterates over `raw_documents`. Since `raw_documents` is null, it does not iterate.
18. The `_count_vocab` method initializes `X` as a sparse CSR matrix with shape `(len(indptr) - 1, len(vocabulary))` and data type `self.dtype`.
19. The `_count_vocab` method returns `vocabulary` and `X`.
20. The `transform` method returns `X`.
