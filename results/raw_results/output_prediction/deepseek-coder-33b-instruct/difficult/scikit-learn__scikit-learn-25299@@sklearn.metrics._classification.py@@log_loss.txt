1. The function `log_loss` is called with `y_true` = [0. 1.] and `y_pred` = [0. 1.].
2. `y_true` and `y_pred` are converted to numpy arrays.
3. `eps` is set to 'auto', so it is set to `np.finfo(y_pred.dtype).eps`, which is 2.220446049250313e-16.
4. `check_consistent_length` is called to check if `y_true`, `y_pred` and `sample_weight` have consistent length.
5. `LabelBinarizer` is used to binarize `y_true`.
6. `y_pred` is clipped to `eps` and `1 - eps`.
7. If `y_pred` is 1D, it is reshaped to 2D.
8. If `y_pred` has only one column, it is appended with its complement.
9. `transformed_labels` is checked to be a numpy array.
10. If `y_pred` sums to 1, a warning is issued.
11. `y_pred` is normalized by dividing each row by its sum.
12. `loss` is calculated as the negative sum of `xlogy(transformed_labels, y_pred)`.
13. `_weighted_sum` is called to calculate the weighted sum of `loss`.
14. The output is returned.
