1. The `_eval_subs` method is called with `old` and `new` arguments.
2. `old` is an instance of `Application` class and `new` is an instance of `FiniteSet` class.
3. The `_eval_subs` method checks if `old` and `new` are the same. If they are, it returns `new`.
4. If `old` and `new` are not the same, it calls the `fallback` method.
5. The `fallback` method iterates over the arguments of `self`.
6. For each argument, it checks if it has a `_eval_subs` method. If it does, it calls this method with `old` and `new` as arguments.
7. If the result of this method is not the same as the original argument, it replaces the original argument with the result.
8. If the `fallback` method finds any replacements, it returns a new instance of `self.func` with the replaced arguments.
9. If the `fallback` method does not find any replacements, it returns `self`.
10. If `_eval_subs` does not find any replacements, it returns `None`.
