Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The code will read the input from console, so `x` will be `32`.
2. The function `factorization(n)` will factorize the number `n` into its prime factors and their counts. The result will be `[[2, 5]]`.
3. The list `l` will be sorted and will be `[[2, 5]]`.
4. The variable `ans` will be `0`.
5. The loop will iterate over the list `l`. Since `l[i][0]` is `2`, it will not be `1`, so it will continue to the next iteration.
6. The variable `s` will be `0`.
7. The variable `num` will be `5`.
8. Since `num` is not `1`, it will enter the loop.
9. The loop will iterate from `1` to `4`.
10. The variable `s` will be `10` after the loop, which is greater than `num`.
11. The variable `j` will be `4`.
12. The variable `ans` will be `4`.
13. The function will return `4`.
