The code is a Python program that calculates the number of substrings of the input string that are divisible by 2019.

Here is the step-by-step execution:
1. The code first reads the input string "18171817".
2. It then calculates the tens modulo 2019 for each position in the string.
3. It then calculates the modulo 2019 of the substring from the beginning to each position in the string.
4. It counts the number of times each modulo 2019 value appears in the string.
5. It then calculates the number of substrings that are divisible by 2019.
6. If the modulo 2019 value is 0, it adds the number of times it appears to the answer.
7. It then adds the number of combinations of 2 substrings that have the same modulo 2019 value to the answer.
8. Finally, it prints the answer.

The code is a Python program that checks if a number is prime.

Here is the step-by-step execution:
1. The code first reads the input number "17".
2. It then checks if the number is prime by dividing it by all numbers up to its square root.
3. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.
4. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.
5. Finally, it prints "Yes" if the number is prime and "No" if it is not.

The code is a Python program that calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element and the median of the array.

Here is the step-by-step execution:
1. The code first reads the input number "3" and the array "1 2 3".
2. It then sorts the array.
3. It calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element and the median of the array.
4. The median of the array is the middle element if the array is sorted.
5. The sum of the absolute differences between each element and the median is calculated as follows:
    - For each element, the sum of the absolute differences is the product of the element and the number of elements less than it (n - i - 1) minus the product of the element and the number of elements greater than it (i).
6. Finally, it prints the sum of the absolute differences.

The code is a Python program that checks if all elements of the second array are in the first array.

Here is the step-by-step execution:
1. The code first reads the input numbers "3 2" and the arrays "1 2 3" and "1 2".
2. It then sorts both arrays.
3. It checks if all elements of the second array are in the first array.
4. It does this by iterating over the elements of the second array and for each element, it checks if there is an element in the first array that is equal to or greater than it.
5. If there is no such element, it prints "No" and returns.
6. If all elements of the second array are in the first array, it prints "Yes".
