1. The function `f` is a helper function for `_osbornei`. It is used to replace trigonometric functions with their hyperbolic counterparts.
2. The input `rv` is a string representation of a trigonometric function.
3. The function `f` is a bottom-up traversal of the expression tree. It replaces trigonometric functions with their hyperbolic counterparts.
4. The function `f` is called with `rv` as the root of the expression tree.
5. The function `f` returns the root of the transformed expression tree.
6. The function `_osbornei` is a top-level function that applies `f` to the input expression.
7. The function `_osbornei` returns the transformed expression.
8. The transformed expression is a string representation of the transformed expression tree.
