1. The function `_mask_nc` is used to mask non-commutative expressions.
2. The input is a string representation of a non-commutative expression.
3. The function will replace non-commutative symbols with dummy symbols.
4. The output will be a tuple containing the masked expression, a dictionary mapping the original non-commutative symbols to the dummy symbols, and a list of the dummy symbols.
