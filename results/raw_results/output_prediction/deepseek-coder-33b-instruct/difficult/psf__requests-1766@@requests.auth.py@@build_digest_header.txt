1. Inside `build_digest_header`, the method is "GET" and the url is "http://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/user/pass".
2. The realm, nonce, qop, opaque, algorithm, and stale are all provided in the `chal` dictionary.
3. The username and password are "user" and "pass".
4. The last_nonce is "b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4" and nonce_count is 1.
5. The algorithm is "MD5".
6. The `hash_utf8` function is defined as `md5_utf8` if the algorithm is "MD5" or "MD5-SESS", and `sha_utf8` if the algorithm is "SHA".
7. The `KD` function is defined as `md5_utf8` if the algorithm is "MD5" or "MD5-SESS", and `sha_utf8` if the algorithm is "SHA".
8. The `HA1` is calculated as `md5_utf8('user:me@kennethreitz.com:pass')`.
9. The `HA2` is calculated as `md5_utf8('GET:/digest-auth/auth/user/pass')`.
10. The `noncebit` is calculated as `'b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4:00000001:b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4:auth:b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4'`.
11. The `respdig` is calculated as `KD(HA1, noncebit)`.
12. The `base` is calculated as `'username="user", realm="me@kennethreitz.com", nonce="b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4", uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", response="respdig", opaque="21d73260ff0b61c1f304ee40444f24bf", algorithm="MD5", qop="auth", nc=00000001, cnonce="b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4"'`.
13. The output is `'Digest username="user", realm="me@kennethreitz.com", nonce="b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4", uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", response="respdig", opaque="21d73260ff0b61c1f304ee40444f24bf", algorithm="MD5", qop="auth", nc=00000001, cnonce="b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4"'`.
