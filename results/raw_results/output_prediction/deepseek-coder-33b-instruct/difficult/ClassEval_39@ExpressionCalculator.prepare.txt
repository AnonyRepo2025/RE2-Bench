1. The `prepare` method is used to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression.
2. The `postfix_stack` is an empty deque.
3. The `operat_priority` is a list of operator priorities.
4. The `expression` is "2+3+4".
5. The `is_operator` method checks if a character is an operator.
6. The `compare` method compares the priority of two operators.
7. The `prepare` method will iterate over the expression and for each character:
    - If it's an operator, it will pop operators from the operator stack and add them to the postfix stack until it finds an operator with lower priority or until it encounters a '('.
    - If it's not an operator, it will add the number to the postfix stack.
8. After the iteration, it will pop the remaining operators from the operator stack and add them to the postfix stack.
9. The postfix stack will be ['2', '3', '+', '4', '+'].
