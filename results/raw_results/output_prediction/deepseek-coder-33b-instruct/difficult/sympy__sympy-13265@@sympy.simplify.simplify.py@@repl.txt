The `repl` function is a replacement function that is used to replace certain functions in an expression with other functions. The `repl` function is used in the `besselsimp` function, which simplifies expressions involving Bessel functions.

The `besselsimp` function first replaces Bessel functions with their equivalent functions, then it replaces Bessel functions with their equivalent functions when the argument is a multiple of 1/2, and finally it expands the Bessel functions.

The `repl` function is a closure that is returned by the `expander` function. The `expander` function is a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and returns a replacement function.

The `expander` function is used to expand the Bessel functions. The `expander` function is used in the `besselsimp` function.

The `expander` function is a closure that is returned by the `replacer` function. The `replacer` function is a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and returns a replacement function.

The `replacer` function is used to replace certain functions with other functions. The `replacer` function is used in the `besselsimp` function.

The `replacer` function is a closure that is returned by the `tominus` function. The `tominus` function is a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and returns a replacement function.

The `tominus` function is used to replace certain functions with their equivalent functions when the argument is a multiple of 1/2. The `tominus` function is used in the `besselsimp` function.

The `tominus` function is a closure that is returned by the `towrite` function. The `towrite` function is a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and returns a replacement function.

The `towrite` function is used to replace certain functions with their equivalent functions. The `towrite` function is used in the `besselsimp` function.
