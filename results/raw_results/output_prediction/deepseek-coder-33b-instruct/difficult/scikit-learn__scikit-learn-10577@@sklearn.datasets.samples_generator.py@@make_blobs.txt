1. The function `make_blobs` is called with `n_samples`=null, `centers`=null, `random_state`=0.
2. `n_samples` is null, so it is set to 100 by default.
3. `centers` is null, so it is set to 3 by default.
4. `random_state` is 0, so it is used to seed the random number generator.
5. The function `make_blobs` returns a tuple of two arrays: X and y.
