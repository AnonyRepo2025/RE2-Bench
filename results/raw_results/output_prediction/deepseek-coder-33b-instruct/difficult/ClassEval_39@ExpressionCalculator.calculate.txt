1. The `transform` method is called with the input "2 + 4 / 4". It removes all whitespace and replaces "=" with nothing. It then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is a "-" and it is the first character or the character before it is an operator, it replaces the "-" with "~". If the first character is "~" and the character after it is "(", it replaces the "~" with "-". The transformed string is "2+4/4".

2. The `prepare` method is called with the transformed string "2+4/4". It initializes an operator stack with a comma. It then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an operator, it checks if there are characters in the buffer. If there are, it adds the buffer to the postfix stack. If the character is a closing parenthesis, it pops operators from the operator stack and adds them to the postfix stack until it finds an opening parenthesis. If the character is an opening parenthesis, it pushes it onto the operator stack. If the character is not an operator, it increments a count of characters in the buffer. After the loop, if there are characters in the buffer, it adds the buffer to the postfix stack. It then pops all operators from the operator stack and adds them to the postfix stack.

3. The `calculate` method is called with the prepared postfix stack. It initializes a result stack. It then iterates over each operator in the postfix stack. If the operator is not an operator, it adds it to the result stack. If the operator is an operator, it pops two values from the result stack, converts them to Decimal, performs the operation, and adds the result to the result stack. It then returns the result stack.

4. The result stack is ["2", "4", "4", "/", "+"]. The result is 2 + 4 / 4 = 3.0.
