1. The player is at (1, 2) and wants to move down.
2. The new position is (2, 2).
3. The map at (2, 2) is ' ', which is not a wall '#'.
4. The new position (2, 2) is not in the list of boxes.
5. So, the player moves to (2, 2).
6. The game is not over because the box is not on the target.
7. So, the output will be False.

1. min_price is initialized to infinity.
2. max_profit is initialized to 0.
3. For the first price 7, min_price is updated to 7.
4. For the second price 1, min_price is updated to 1.
5. For the third price 5, max_profit is updated to 4 (5 - 1).
6. For the fourth price 3, min_price is updated to 1.
7. For the fifth price 6, max_profit is updated to 5 (6 - 1).
8. For the sixth price 4, max_profit remains 5.
9. So, the output will be 5.

1. curSum and maxSum are initialized to the first number in the list, -2.
2. For the next number 1, curSum is updated to max(1, -1) which is 1. maxSum is updated to max(-2, 1) which is 1.
3. For the next number -3, curSum is updated to max(-3, -2) which is -2. maxSum is updated to max(1, -2) which is 1.
4. For the next number 4, curSum is updated to max(4, 2) which is 4. maxSum is updated to max(1, 4) which is 4.
5. For the next number -1, curSum is updated to max(-1, 3) which is 3. maxSum is updated to max(4, 3) which is 4.
6. For the next number 2, curSum is updated to max(2, 5) which is 5. maxSum is updated to max(4, 5) which is 5.
7. For the next number 1, curSum is updated to max(1, 6) which is 6. maxSum is updated to max(5, 6) which is 6.
8. For the next number -5, curSum is updated to max(-5, 1) which is 1. maxSum is updated to max(6, 1) which is 6.
9. For the next number 4, curSum is updated to max(4, 5) which is 5. maxSum is updated to max(6, 5) which is 6.

1. The first character is '(', which is not in the mapping. So, it is appended to the stack.
2. The second character is ')', which is in the mapping. The top element of the stack is '(', which matches with ')'. So, the top element is popped from the stack.
3. The third character is '[', which is not in the mapping. So, it is appended to the stack.
4. The fourth character is ']', which is in the mapping. The top element of the stack is '[', which matches with ']'. So, the top element is popped from the stack.
5. The fifth character is '{', which is not in the mapping. So, it is appended to the stack.
6. The sixth character is '}', which is in the mapping. The top element of the stack is '{', which matches with '}'. So, the top element is popped from the stack.
7. The stack is empty, so the output will be True.
