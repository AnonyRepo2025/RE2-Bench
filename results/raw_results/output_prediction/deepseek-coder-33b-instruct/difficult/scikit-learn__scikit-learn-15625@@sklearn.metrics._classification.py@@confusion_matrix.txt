1. The function `confusion_matrix` is used to compute confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of a classification.
2. The input `y_true` and `y_pred` are the true and predicted labels respectively.
3. The `labels` parameter is used to specify the labels to include in the output. If it is None, all unique labels in `y_true` and `y_pred` are used.
4. The `sample_weight` parameter is used to weight the samples. If it is None, all samples are weighted equally.
5. The `normalize` parameter is used to normalize the output. If it is 'true', the output is normalized by the number of samples in each class. If it is 'pred', the output is normalized by the number of samples predicted in each class. If it is 'all', the output is normalized by the total number of samples.
6. The output is a confusion matrix. The rows represent the true labels and the columns represent the predicted labels. The diagonal elements represent the number of points for which the true and predicted labels are the same, while off-diagonal elements are those that are mislabeled by the classifier.
