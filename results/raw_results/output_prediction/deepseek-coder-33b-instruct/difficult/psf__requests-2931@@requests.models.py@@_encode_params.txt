1. Inside `_encode_params`, `data` is an empty dictionary.
2. `data` is not a string, bytes, bool, int, or a readable object, so it checks if `data` is a mapping.
3. `data` is a dictionary, so it calls `data.items()` to get a list of its key-value pairs.
4. `data` is an empty dictionary, so `data.items()` returns an empty list.
5. `to_key_val_list` is called with an empty list, which returns an empty list.
6. `urlencode` is called with an empty list and `doseq=True`, which returns an empty string.
