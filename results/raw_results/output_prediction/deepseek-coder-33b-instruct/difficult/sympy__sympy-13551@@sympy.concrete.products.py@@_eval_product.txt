1. The `_eval_product` function is a method of the `Product` class. It takes two arguments: `term` and `limits`.
2. `term` is a string that represents a mathematical expression.
3. `limits` is a list of two elements: `k`, `a`, and `n`.
4. The function tries to evaluate the product of `term` over the range `k` from `a` to `n`.
5. If `term` is a polynomial in `k`, it uses the polynomial's coefficients to compute the product.
6. If `term` is an addition, it uses the exponential of the sum to compute the product.
7. If `term` is a multiplication, it recursively evaluates the product of each term in `term`.
8. If `term` is a power, it recursively evaluates the base and exponent separately.
9. If `term` is a `Product`, it recursively evaluates `term`.
10. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns `None`.
