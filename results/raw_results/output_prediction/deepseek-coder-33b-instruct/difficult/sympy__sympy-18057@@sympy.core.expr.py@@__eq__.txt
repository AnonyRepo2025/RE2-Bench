1. The `__eq__` method is called with `self` as an empty dictionary and `other` as a string "picoweber".
2. The `other` is converted to a sympified version using `_sympify`.
3. The `other` is an instance of `SympifyError`, so it raises a `SympifyError`.
4. The `__eq__` method returns `NotImplemented`.
