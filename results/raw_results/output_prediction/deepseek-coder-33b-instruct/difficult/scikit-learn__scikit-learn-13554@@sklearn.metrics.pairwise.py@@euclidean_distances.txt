1. The function `euclidean_distances` calculates the pairwise Euclidean distances between two arrays.
2. The input arrays are `X` and `Y`.
3. The `squared` parameter is set to `true`, so the function will return the squared Euclidean distances.
4. The function first checks the input arrays and converts them to the correct data type.
5. Then it calculates the squared Euclidean distances between the two arrays.
6. The squared Euclidean distance between two points `x` and `y` in a Euclidean space is the squared norm of the difference of the two points.
7. The function returns the squared Euclidean distances as a 2D array.
