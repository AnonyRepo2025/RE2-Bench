1. The board is 10x10.
2. The first row is all 'O'.
3. The last row is all 'X'.
4. The function `check_winner` checks for five in a row of the same symbol in any direction.
5. The function `_check_five_in_a_row` checks for five in a row of the same symbol in a given direction.
6. The function `check_winner` iterates over all cells on the board, and for each cell, it checks all four directions.
7. The function `_check_five_in_a_row` checks if the next four cells in the given direction are the same symbol.
8. If it finds five in a row, it returns the symbol.
9. If it doesn't find five in a row, it returns None.
10. The function `check_winner` returns the first symbol that has five in a row.
11. The first row has five 'O's, so the function `check_winner` returns 'O'.

1. The function `isValid` checks if the input string `s` is a valid parentheses string.
2. A valid parentheses string is a string that consists of open brackets '(', '{', '[' and close brackets ')', '}', ']', where the types of brackets match and are in the correct order.
3. The function `isValid` uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets.
4. For each character in `s`, if it is a close bracket, it checks if the top element of the stack is the corresponding open bracket. If it is not, it returns False.
5. If it is an open bracket, it pushes it to the stack.
6. If the stack is empty at the end, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
7. In the given input, the string `s` is "()[]{}".
8. The first character is '(', so it is pushed to the stack.
9. The second character is ')', so it checks if the top element of the stack is '('. It is, so it pops the top element.
10. The third character is '[', so it is pushed to the stack.
11. The fourth character is ']', so it checks if the top element of the stack is '['. It is, so it pops the top element.
12. The fifth character is '{', so it is pushed to the stack.
13. The sixth character is '}', so it checks if the top element of the stack is '{'. It is, so it pops the top element.
14. The stack is empty, so the function `isValid` returns True.
