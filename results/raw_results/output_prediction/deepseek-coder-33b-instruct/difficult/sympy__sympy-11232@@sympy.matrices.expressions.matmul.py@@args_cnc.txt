1. Inside `args_cnc`, `self.as_coeff_matrices()` is called.
2. Inside `as_coeff_matrices`, `scalars` is a list of all scalars in `self.args` and `matrices` is a list of all matrices in `self.args`.
3. Since `self.args` is empty, `scalars` and `matrices` are both empty.
4. So, `coeff` is `Mul()` and `coeff_c` and `coeff_nc` are both empty.
5. `coeff_c` is `[]` and `coeff_nc` is `[]`.
6. So, `args_cnc` returns `([], [])`.
