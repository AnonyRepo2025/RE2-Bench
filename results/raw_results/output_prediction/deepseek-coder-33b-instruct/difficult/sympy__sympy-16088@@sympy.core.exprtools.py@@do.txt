1. The input is a string representation of a mathematical expression.
2. The function `do` is a recursive function that applies a series of transformations to the input expression.
3. The transformations include:
    - Factoring out common factors.
    - Simplifying the expression using the `powsimp` function.
    - Converting the expression to a canonical form.
4. The output of the function is the transformed expression.
