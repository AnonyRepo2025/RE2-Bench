1. The `__init__` method initializes the object with the given parameters.
2. The `clear_expr` method removes all characters from the expression that are not brackets.
3. The `check_balanced_brackets` method checks if the brackets in the expression are balanced.

Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `__init__(expr="[(){}")` initializes the object with the given expression.
2. `clear_expr()` removes all characters from the expression that are not brackets. The expression becomes "[(]"
3. `check_balanced_brackets()` checks if the brackets in the expression are balanced.
4. The first bracket is "[", which is a left bracket. It is added to the stack.
5. The second bracket is "(", which is a left bracket. It is added to the stack.
6. The third bracket is ")", which is a right bracket. The last bracket in the stack is "(", which is a matching pair. The "(" is removed from the stack.
7. The fourth bracket is "{", which is a left bracket. It is added to the stack.
8. The fifth bracket is "}", which is a right bracket. The last bracket in the stack is "{", which is a matching pair. The "{" is removed from the stack.
9. The stack is not empty, so the brackets are not balanced. The method returns False.
