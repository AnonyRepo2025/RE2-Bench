1. Inside `__add__`, it creates a new Media object `combined`.
2. `combined._css_lists` is a copy of `self._css_lists`, which is None.
3. `combined._js_lists` is a copy of `self._js_lists`, which is None.
4. Then it iterates over `other._css_lists` and `other._js_lists`, but since they are None, it does not add anything to `combined._css_lists` and `combined._js_lists`.
5. Finally, it returns `combined`.

```
{
    "_css_lists": [],
    "_js_lists": []
}
