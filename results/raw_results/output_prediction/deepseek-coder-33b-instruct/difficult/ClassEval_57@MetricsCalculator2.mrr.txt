1. The input is a list of two elements: a list of 0s and 1s, and an integer 4.
2. The function checks if the type of data is a list or a tuple.
3. If the type is a list, it iterates over each sublist in the list.
4. For each sublist, it calculates the reciprocal rank (1/rank) for each element in the sublist.
5. It multiplies the sublist with the reciprocal rank array.
6. It then finds the first non-zero element in the resulting array and assigns it to mr.
7. It appends mr to separate_result.
8. Finally, it returns the mean of separate_result and separate_result itself.
