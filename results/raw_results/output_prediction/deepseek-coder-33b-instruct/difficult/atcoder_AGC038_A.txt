The code is a function that generates a 2D array of characters. The function takes four parameters: H, W, A, and B. The function creates a 2D array of characters with dimensions H x W. It then fills the array with characters '0' and '1' based on the values of A and B. The function then prints the array.

The input is "1000 1000 0 486". This means H=1000, W=1000, A=0, and B=486.

The function will create a 2D array of 1000x1000. It will fill the first 486 rows with '1' and the rest with '0'. It will fill the first column with '1' and the rest with '0'.

The output will be a 1000x1000 grid of '1' and '0'.
