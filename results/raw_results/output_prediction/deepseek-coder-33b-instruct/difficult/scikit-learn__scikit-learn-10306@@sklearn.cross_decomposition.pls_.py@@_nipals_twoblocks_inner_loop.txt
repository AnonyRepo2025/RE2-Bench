1. The function `_nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop` is a part of the PLS (Partial Least Squares) algorithm, which is a method for dimension reduction and feature extraction.
2. The function takes in two matrices X and Y, and performs an iterative process to find the weights for X and Y that maximize the covariance between the two.
3. The mode parameter determines whether the weights for X or Y are updated first.
4. The function returns the weights for X and Y, as well as the number of iterations it took to converge.
5. The function uses the Pseudo-Inverse of the matrix to calculate the weights.
6. The function uses the dot product of the matrices to calculate the covariance.
7. The function uses the norm of the weights to normalize the weights.
8. The function uses the tolerance parameter to determine when the weights have converged.
9. The function uses the maximum number of iterations parameter to determine when to stop the iterations.
10. The function uses the ConvergenceWarning to warn the user if the maximum number of iterations is reached.
