1. The function `f` is a bottom-up simplification function that applies a transformation function to each node in the expression tree.
2. The transformation function `f` is defined as follows:
    - It first checks if the node is a multiplication. If not, it returns the node as is.
    - It then converts the node to a dictionary of powers.
    - It then iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary.
    - For each key-value pair, it checks if the key is an addition of two elements. If not, it skips the pair.
    - It then checks if the key is a power of `exp(1)`. If not, it skips the pair.
    - It then checks if the key is a multiplication of `exp(1)` and a constant. If not, it skips the pair.
    - It then checks if the key is a multiplication of `exp(1)` and a constant raised to a power. If not, it skips the pair.
    - It then checks if the key is a multiplication of `exp(1)` and a constant raised to a power and a constant. If not, it skips the pair.
    - It then checks if the key is a multiplication of `exp(1)` and a constant raised to a power and a constant raised to a power. If not, it skips the pair.
    - It then checks if the key is a multiplication of `exp(1)` and a constant raised to a power and a constant raised to a power and a constant. If not, it skips the pair.
