1. The function `format_string` takes a string `x` as input.
2. The string `x` is split into two parts: `lstr` and `rstr`. `lstr` is the part before the decimal point, and `rstr` is the part after the decimal point.
3. `lstr` is reversed and padded with zeros at the end to make its length a multiple of 3.
4. For each group of 3 digits in `lstr`, the function `trans_three` is called to convert the digits into words.
5. If `rstr` is not empty, it means there are cents. The function `trans_two` is called to convert the cents into words.
6. The function `parse_more` is called to get the suffix for the current group of digits.
7. The words for each group of digits are combined into a sentence.
8. If `lstr` is empty, the function returns 'ZERO ONLY'. Otherwise, the function returns the sentence.
