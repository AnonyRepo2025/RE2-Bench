1. The `__eq__` method is called with `self` as an instance of `Basic` and `other` as "I*x".
2. The `other` is converted to a sympy object using `sympify`.
3. The `sympify` method checks if `other` is an instance of `Basic`. Since "I*x" is not an instance of `Basic`, it tries to convert it to a sympy object.
4. The `sympify` method tries to convert "I*x" to a sympy object by parsing it using `parse_expr`.
5. The `parse_expr` method parses "I*x" and returns a sympy object.
6. The `__eq__` method then compares the sympy object returned by `sympify` with `self`.
7. Since `self` is an instance of `Basic` and the sympy object returned by `sympify` is also an instance of `Basic`, the `__eq__` method calls the `_hashable_content` method of `self` and `other`.
8. The `_hashable_content` method of `self` returns `self._args`, which is `None`.
9. The `_hashable_content` method of `other` returns the arguments of the sympy object returned by `sympify`, which are `I` and `x`.
10. The `__eq__` method then compares `self._args` (which is `None`) with the arguments of the sympy object returned by `sympify` (which are `I` and `x`).
11. Since `self._args` (which is `None`) is not equal to the arguments of the sympy object returned by `sympify` (which are `I` and `x`), the `__eq__` method returns `False`.
