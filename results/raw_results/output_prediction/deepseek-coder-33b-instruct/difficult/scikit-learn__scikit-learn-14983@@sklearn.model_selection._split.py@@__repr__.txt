1. Inside `__repr__`, it calls `_build_repr(self)`.
2. `_build_repr(self)` is a function that builds a string representation of the object.
3. The string representation of the object is a dictionary with keys as the attribute names and values as the attribute values.
4. The attribute names are `test_fold` and `unique_folds`.
5. The attribute values are `[1 1 2 2]` and `[1 2]` respectively.
