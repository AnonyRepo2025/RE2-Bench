1. Inside `urlencode`, `query` is a list of lists.
2. The first element of each sublist is a string, and the second element is an integer.
3. The `original_urlencode` function is called with `query_params` as its argument.
4. `query_params` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair.
5. The output of `urlencode` will be a string that represents the query parameters in the URL.
