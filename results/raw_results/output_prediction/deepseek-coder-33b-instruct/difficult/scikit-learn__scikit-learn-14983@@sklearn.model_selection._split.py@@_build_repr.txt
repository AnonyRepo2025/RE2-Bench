1. Inside `_build_repr`, `self` is an instance of `LeavePGroupsOut` class.
2. `args` and `kwargs` are empty.
3. `args` is a list of parameters of `__init__` method of `LeavePGroupsOut` class.
4. `params` is a dictionary where keys are parameter names and values are their corresponding values.
5. `params` is built by iterating over `args` and getting the value of each parameter from `self`.
6. `params` is then used to build the string representation of `self`.
