1. Inside `as_string`, `self.migration.operations` is None, so `operations` is an empty string.
2. `self.migration.replaces` is also None, so `replaces_str` is an empty string.
3. `self.migration.initial` is also None, so `initial_str` is an empty string.
4. `self.migration.dependencies` is also an empty list, so `dependencies` is an empty string.
5. `self.include_header` is False, so `migration_header` is an empty string.
6. `imports` is a set containing "from django.db import migrations".
7. Since `self.needs_manual_porting` is False, the manual porting part is not included in the output.
8. The final output is a string that contains all the parts (`migration_header`, `imports`, `replaces_str`, `initial_str`, `dependencies`, `operations`) in the correct order.
