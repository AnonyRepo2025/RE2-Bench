1. `_finger` function takes an equation as input and returns a dictionary where keys are tuples of integers and values are lists of symbols.
2. The equation is `frozenset({y & ~x, x & ~y})`.
3. The `_finger` function iterates over the arguments of the equation.
4. For each argument, it checks if the argument is a symbol, a negation of a symbol, or a combination of symbols and negations.
5. If the argument is a symbol, it increments the first element of the list associated with the symbol.
6. If the argument is a negation of a symbol, it increments the second element of the list associated with the symbol.
7. If the argument is a combination of symbols and negations, it increments the third and fourth elements of the lists associated with the symbols.
8. The function returns a dictionary where the keys are tuples of integers and the values are lists of symbols.
9. The tuples of integers represent the number of occurrences of symbols, negations of symbols, symbols in combinations, and negations in combinations.
10. The lists of symbols represent the symbols themselves.
11. The output of the function is a dictionary where the keys are tuples of integers and the values are lists of symbols.
