1. Inside `_route_to_regex`, the input route is "<lang>"/"<path:url>"/.
2. The route is split into parts by the regular expression `_PATH_PARAMETER_COMPONENT_RE`.
3. The first part is "<lang>", which matches the regular expression `_PATH_PARAMETER_COMPONENT_RE`.
4. The converter for "<lang>" is "str" (default), so the regex for "<lang>" is "[^/]+".
5. The second part is "<path:url>", which matches the regular expression `_PATH_PARAMETER_COMPONENT_RE`.
6. The converter for "<path:url>" is "path", so the regex for "<path:url>" is ".*".
7. The final regex is "^(?P<lang>[^/]+)/(?P<url>.*)$".
8. The converters are {"lang": "str", "url": "path"}.
