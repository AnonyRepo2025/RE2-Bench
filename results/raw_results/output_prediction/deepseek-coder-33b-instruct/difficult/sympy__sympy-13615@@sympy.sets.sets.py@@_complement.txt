1. Inside `_complement`, `other` is a FiniteSet with elements {10, 15}.
2. Since `other` is a FiniteSet, it calls:
    return Union((o - self for o in other.args))
3. `other.args` is a list of elements in the FiniteSet, so `o - self` is subtracting `self` from each element in `other.args`.
4. `self` is an empty set, so `o - self` is `o` itself.
5. Therefore, `other.args` is the same as `other._elements`, which is {10, 15}.
6. So, `Union((o - self for o in other.args))` is the same as `Union((o for o in other.args))`.
7. `Union` is a set of all elements in the input sets, so `Union((o for o in other.args))` is the same as `other`.
8. Therefore, `_complement` returns `other`.
