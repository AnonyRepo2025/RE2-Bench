1. The function `_parse_scatter_color_args` is a static method of the class `Axes`. It takes three arguments: `c`, `edgecolors`, and `kwargs`.
2. `c` is null, `edgecolors` is "r", and `kwargs` is an empty dictionary.
3. `xsize` is 2, and `get_next_color_func` is an empty dictionary.
4. Since `c` is null, `c_was_none` is True.
5. Since `c` is null and `kwcolor` is null, `c` is set to "b" (blue).
6. Since `edgecolors` is "r", `edgecolors` remains "r".
7. Since `facecolors` is null, `facecolors` remains null.
8. The function returns a tuple `(c, colors, edgecolors)`, where `c` is "b", `colors` is null, and `edgecolors` is "r".
