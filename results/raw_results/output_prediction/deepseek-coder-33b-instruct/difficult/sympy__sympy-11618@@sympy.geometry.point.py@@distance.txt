1. Inside `distance`, `p` is a list of numbers.
2. Since `type(p) is not type(self)` is True, it calls:
    return sqrt(sum([(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(self.args, p.args if isinstance(p, Point) else p)]))
3. `self.args` is an empty list, so `self.args` and `p` are the same.
4. `sqrt(sum([(a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(self.args, p.args if isinstance(p, Point) else p)]))` is the Euclidean distance between `self.args` and `p`.
5. Since `self.args` is an empty list, `self.args` and `p` are the same, so the Euclidean distance between `self.args` and `p` is 0.
