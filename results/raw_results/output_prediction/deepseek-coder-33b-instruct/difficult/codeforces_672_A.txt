The code is a bit complex, so let's break it down.
1. The code initializes an empty list `li` and a variable `ind` to 0.
2. It then enters a loop from 1 to 370.
3. For each number `i` in the range, it calculates the number of digits in `i` by repeatedly dividing `i` by 10 and incrementing a counter `count`.
4. If `count` is 1, it appends `i` to `li`.
5. If `count` is 2 or 3, it creates a temporary list `temp`, populates it with the digits of `i` in reverse order, and appends it to `li`.
6. After the loop, it removes the last two elements from `li`.
7. It then reads an integer `n` from the console.
8. Finally, it prints the `n`-th element of `li`.

Given the input 423, the 423rd element of `li` is 2.
