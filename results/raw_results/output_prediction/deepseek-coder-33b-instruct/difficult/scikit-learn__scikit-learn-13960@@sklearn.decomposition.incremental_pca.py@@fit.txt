1. The `fit` method is called with the input data X.
2. The `fit` method first checks if the input data X is a sparse matrix. If it is, it checks if it is in a supported format and converts it to the desired format if necessary.
3. It then checks if the input data X is a 2D array. If it is not, it raises a ValueError.
4. If the `n_components` attribute is None, it sets it to the minimum of the number of samples and features in X.
5. If the `n_components` attribute is not None, it checks if it is between 1 and the number of features in X. If it is not, it raises a ValueError.
6. If the `n_components` attribute is not None, it checks if it is less than or equal to the number of samples in X. If it is not, it raises a ValueError.
7. If the `components_` attribute is not None and its shape is not equal to `n_components_`, it raises a ValueError.
8. If the `n_samples_seen_` attribute is not set, it sets it to 0 and `mean_` and `var_` to 0.0.
9. It then calls the `partial_fit` method for each batch of the input data X.
10. The `partial_fit` method first checks if the input data X is a sparse matrix. If it is, it raises a TypeError.
11. It then checks if the input data X is a 2D array. If it is not, it raises a ValueError.
12. It then checks if the `n_components` attribute is None, if it is, it sets it to the minimum of the number of samples and features in X.
13. It then checks if the `n_components` attribute is not None, if it is, it checks if it is between 1 and the number of features in X. If it is not, it raises a ValueError.
14. It then checks if the `n_components` attribute is not None, if it is, it checks if it is less than or equal to the number of samples in X. If it is not, it raises a ValueError.
15. It then checks if the `components_` attribute is not None and its shape is not equal to `n_components_`, if it is, it raises a ValueError.
16. It then checks if the `n_samples_seen_` attribute is not set, if it is, it sets it to 0 and `mean_` and `var_` to 0.0.
17. It then subtracts the mean of the input data X from X.
18. It then calls the `_incremental_mean_and_var` method to calculate the mean and variance of the input data X.
19. It then calls the `linalg.svd` method to calculate the singular value decomposition of the input data X.
20. It then calls the `svd_flip` method to flip the signs of the singular vectors.
21. It then calculates the explained variance and the explained variance ratio.
22. It then sets the `n_samples_seen_` attribute to the number of total samples, `mean_` to the mean of the input data X, `var_` to the variance of the input data X, `singular_values_` to the singular values, `explained_variance_` to the explained variance, `explained_variance_ratio_` to the explained variance ratio, `noise_variance_` to the noise variance.
23. It then checks if the number of components is less than the number of features in X, if it is, it calculates the noise variance.
24. It then returns the updated self.
