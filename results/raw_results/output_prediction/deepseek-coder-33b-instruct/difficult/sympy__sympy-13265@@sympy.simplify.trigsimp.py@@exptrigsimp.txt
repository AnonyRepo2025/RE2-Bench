1. The input is a string representation of a mathematical expression.
2. The function `exptrigsimp` simplifies the expression by applying various rules.
3. The rules are defined in the function `exp_trig` and `f`.
4. The function `bottom_up` is used to apply the rules to the expression.
5. The function `sympify` is used to convert the string representation of the expression into a symbolic expression.
6. The function `has` is used to check if the expression contains a certain pattern.
7. The function `args` is used to get the arguments of the expression.
8. The function `_has` is used to check if the expression has a certain pattern.
9. The function `_has_matcher` is used to check if the expression matches a certain pattern.
10. The function `preorder_traversal` is used to traverse the expression in a preorder manner.
11. The function `rewrite` is used to rewrite the expression.
12. The function `_eval_rewrite` is used to evaluate the rewrite.
13. The function `func` is used to get the function of the expression.
14. The function `__new__` is used to create a new instance of the class.
15. The function `_sympify` is used to convert the string representation of the expression into a symbolic expression.
16. The function `__hash__` is used to get the hash of the expression.
