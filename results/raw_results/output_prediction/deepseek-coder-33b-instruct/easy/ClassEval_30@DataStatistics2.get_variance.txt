1. __init__(data=[1 2 3 4]) stores self.data = np.array([1 2 3 4]).
2. get_variance() calculates the variance of self.data.
3. np.var([1 2 3 4]) calculates the variance of the array [1 2 3 4].
4. The variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.
5. The mean of [1 2 3 4] is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5.
6. The squared differences from the mean are (1-2.5)^2, (2-2.5)^2, (3-2.5)^2, (4-2.5)^2.
7. The variance is the average of these squared differences.
8. The variance is (1.25 + 0.25 + 1.25 + 4.25) / 4 = 1.5.
9. np.var() returns the variance rounded to 2 decimal places.
10. Therefore, `get_variance()` will return: 1.5.

1. isValid("()[]{}") checks if the string s is a valid parentheses string.
2. The string s is "()[]{}".
3. The mapping is {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}.
4. For each character in s:
    a. If the character is a closing bracket (")", "}", or "]"), it checks if the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket.
    b. If the top element is not the corresponding opening bracket, it returns False.
    c. If the top element is the corresponding opening bracket, it removes the top element from the stack.
    d. If the character is not a closing bracket, it adds the character to the stack.
5. After checking all characters, if the stack is empty, it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it returns False.
6. The string s is "()[]{}".
7. The stack starts as an empty list.
8. For the first character "(", it adds "(" to the stack.
9. For the second character ")", it removes "(" from the stack.
10. For the third character "{", it adds "{" to the stack.
11. For the fourth character "}", it removes "{" from the stack.
12. For the fifth character "[", it adds "[" to the stack.
13. For the sixth character "]", it removes "[" from the stack.
14. After checking all characters, the stack is empty.
15. Therefore, `isValid("()[]{}")` will return: True.
