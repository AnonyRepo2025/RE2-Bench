The function `f` is a simple function that merges two dictionaries. The first dictionary `a` has two keys: "w" and "wi", and the second dictionary `b` has one key: "w". The function returns a new dictionary that includes all keys from both dictionaries.

The input dictionary `a` has two keys: "w" and "wi", and the input dictionary `b` has one key: "w".

The output dictionary will have three keys: "w", "wi", and "w". The value of "w" in the output dictionary will be the value of "w" in the input dictionary `b`, which is 3. The value of "wi" in the output dictionary will be the value of "wi" in the input dictionary `a`, which is 10.
