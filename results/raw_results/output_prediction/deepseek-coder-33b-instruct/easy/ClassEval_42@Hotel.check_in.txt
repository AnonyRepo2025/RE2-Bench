1. The `check_in` method is called with `room_type` as "single", `room_number` as 2, and `name` as "guest 1".
2. The `room_type` "single" is not in the `booked_rooms` dictionary, so the method returns `False`.

1. The `isValid` method is called with `s` as "()".
2. The first character is "(", which is not in the `mapping` dictionary, so it is appended to the `stack`.
3. The second character is ")", which is in the `mapping` dictionary, so the last element of the `stack` is popped and compared with the corresponding value in the `mapping` dictionary.
4. The `stack` is empty, so the `top_element` is '#'. The corresponding value in the `mapping` dictionary for ")" is "(", which is not equal to '#'.
5. Therefore, the method returns `False`.
