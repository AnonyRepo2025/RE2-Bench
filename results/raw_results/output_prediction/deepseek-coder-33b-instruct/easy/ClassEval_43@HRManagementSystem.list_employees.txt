1. __init__() initializes the employees dictionary.
2. list_employees() is called.
3. The employees dictionary is not empty, so it iterates over each employee.
4. For each employee, it creates a new dictionary employee_details.
5. It adds the employee_ID to employee_details.
6. It then iterates over the employee_info dictionary and adds each key-value pair to employee_details.
7. Finally, it adds employee_details to the employee_data dictionary with the employee_ID as the key.

So, the output will be:
