Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `text.rpartition('0')` splits the string into three parts: everything before the last occurrence of '0', the '0' itself, and everything after the '0'. The result is `('qq', '0', 'tt')`.
2. `if l[2] == '':` checks if the part after the '0' is empty. It is not, so the condition is False.
3. `return f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find('0') + 1}'` returns a string that contains the length of the part before the '0' and the position of the '0' in the part after the '0'. The position is found with `l[2].find('0')`, which is 0-indexed, so we add 1 to get the position in 1-indexed form. The result is `'2:1'`.

Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `range(1, n+1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. `if n % i == 0` checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, `i` is a divisor of `n`.
3. `[i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0]` generates a list of all divisors of `n`.
4. The result is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]`.
