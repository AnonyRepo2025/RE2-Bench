Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `value` and `width`.
2. `value` is 5 and `width` is 1.
3. Since `value` is greater than or equal to 0, the function will return `str(value).zfill(width)`.
4. `str(value)` converts `value` to a string, which is "5".
5. `.zfill(width)` pads the string on the left with zeros to fill `width`.
6. Since `width` is 1, the string "5" will be returned as is.

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `value` and `width`.
2. `value` is -5 and `width` is 2.
3. Since `value` is less than 0, the function will return `'-' + str(-value).zfill(width)`.
4. `-value` converts `value` to its positive counterpart, which is 5.
5. `str(-value)` converts 5 to a string, which is "5".
6. `.zfill(width)` pads the string on the left with zeros to fill `width`.
7. Since `width` is 2, the string "5" will be padded with a zero on the left, resulting in "05".
8. The function will return '-' + "05", which is "-05".

4. `str(value)` converts `value` to a string, which is "0".
