1. __init__(url="https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#aaa") stores self.url = "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#aaa".
2. get_fragment() finds the index of '#' in the url, which is 40.
3. It then returns the substring from the character after '#' to the end of the url.

[THOUGHT]
1. twoSum(nums=[2, 7, 11, 15], target=9) is called.
2. We initialize an empty hashmap.
3. We iterate over the list nums.
4. For the first number 2, we check if target - num (9 - 2 = 7) is in the hashmap. It is not, so we add 2 to the hashmap with the index 0.
5. For the second number 7, we check if target - num (9 - 7 = 2) is in the hashmap. It is, so we return the indices of 2 and 7, which are 0 and 1.

[THOUGHT]
1. isValid(s="()[]{}") is called.
2. We initialize an empty stack and a mapping of closing brackets to opening brackets.
3. We iterate over the string s.
4. For the first character '(', it is not in the mapping, so we append it to the stack.
5. For the second character ')', it is in the mapping, so we pop the top element from the stack and check if it is the corresponding opening bracket. It is, so we continue.
6. For the third character '[', it is not in the mapping, so we append it to the stack.
7. For the fourth character ']', it is in the mapping, so we pop the top element from the stack and check if it is the corresponding opening bracket. It is, so we continue.
8. For the fifth character '{', it is not in the mapping, so we append it to the stack.
9. For the sixth character '}', it is in the mapping, so we pop the top element from the stack and check if it is the corresponding opening bracket. It is, so we continue.
10. We check if the stack is empty. It is, so we return True.

[THOUGHT]
1. maxProfit(prices=[7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]) is called.
2. We initialize min_price as infinity and max_profit as 0.
3. We iterate over the list prices.
4. For the first price 7, it is less than min_price, so we update min_price to 7.
5. For the second price 1, it is less than min_price, so we update min_price to 1.
6. For the third price 5, it is greater than min_price, so we calculate the profit (5 - 1 = 4) and update max_profit to 4.
7. For the fourth price 3, it is less than min_price, so we update min_price to 3.
8. For the fifth price 6, it is greater than min_price, so we calculate the profit (6 - 3 = 3) and update max_profit to 4.
9. For the sixth price 4, it is less than min_price, so we update min_price to 4.
10. We return max_profit, which is 4.

[THOUGHT]
1. isPalindrome(s="A man, a plan, a canal: Panama") is called.
2. We remove all non-alphanumeric characters and convert the string to lowercase. The result is "amanaplanacanalpanama".
3. We check if the string is equal to its reverse. The string is "amanaplanacanalpanama", and its reverse is also "amanaplanacanalpanama", so the string is a palindrome.
4. We return True.
