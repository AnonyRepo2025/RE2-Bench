1. `.lstrip(froms)` removes leading characters in `text` that are in `froms`. The leading characters in `text` are "0 t 1", and the characters in `froms` are "st 0\t\n  ". The leading characters in `text` that are also in `froms` are "0 t 1", so they are removed. The `text` becomes "cos ".
2. `.rstrip(froms)` removes trailing characters in `text` that are in `froms`. The trailing characters in `text` are "cos ", and the characters in `froms` are "st 0\t\n  ". The trailing characters in `text` that are also in `froms` are "cos ", so they are removed. The `text` becomes "".
