Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The `items` string is split into a list of words. The list is: ['qy.', 'dg.', 'rnvprt', 'rse..', 'irtwv', 'tx..'].
2. The code then iterates over each word in the list.
3. The first word 'qy.' is not in the `target` string "wtwdoacb", so it continues to the next word.
4. The second word 'dg.' is not in the `target` string "wtwdoacb", so it continues to the next word.
5. The third word 'rnvprt' is not in the `target` string "wtwdoacb", so it continues to the next word.
6. The fourth word 'rse..' is not in the `target` string "wtwdoacb", so it continues to the next word.
7. The fifth word 'irtwv' is not in the `target` string "wtwdoacb", so it continues to the next word.
8. The sixth word 'tx..' is not in the `target` string "wtwdoacb", so it continues to the next word.
9. The code has iterated over all words in the list and none of them are in the `target` string.
10. The function returns '.'.
