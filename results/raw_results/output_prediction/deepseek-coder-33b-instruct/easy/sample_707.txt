Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The length of the input text is 7.
2. The index is calculated as `position % (length + 1)`. Since 1 % 8 = 1, the index is 1.
3. The index is not less than 0, so we don't enter the if branch.
4. We create a list of characters from the text.
5. We remove the character at index 1 from the list.
6. We join the list back into a string and return it.
