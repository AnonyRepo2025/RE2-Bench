Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The list `lst` contains [4, 4, 6, 8].
2. The list comprehension `[lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0]` generates a new list that contains every second element of `lst` that is even.
3. The `range(1, len(lst), 2)` generates a sequence of indices starting from 1 (the second element of `lst`) and incrementing by 2 each time (skipping every other element).
4. The `if lst[i] % 2 == 0` condition filters out the elements that are not even.
5. The `sum` function adds up all the elements in the resulting list.
6. The return value will be 8.
