1. The data is [2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8].
2. We sort the data: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
3. The length of the data is 7, which is odd.
4. The middle index is 7 // 2 = 3.
5. The median is the number at the middle index: 5.

1. The string "()[]{}" is iterated over.
2. The first character is "(". It is not in the mapping, so it is appended to the stack.
3. The second character is ")". It is in the mapping, so the top element of the stack is popped and compared with the corresponding value in the mapping. It is "(", so the comparison is True and the function continues.
4. The third character is "{". It is not in the mapping, so it is appended to the stack.
5. The fourth character is "}". It is in the mapping, so the top element of the stack is popped and compared with the corresponding value in the mapping. It is "{", so the comparison is True and the function continues.
6. The fifth character is "[". It is not in the mapping, so it is appended to the stack.
7. The sixth character is "]". It is in the mapping, so the top element of the stack is popped and compared with the corresponding value in the mapping. It is "[", so the comparison is True and the function continues.
8. The stack is empty, so the function returns True.
