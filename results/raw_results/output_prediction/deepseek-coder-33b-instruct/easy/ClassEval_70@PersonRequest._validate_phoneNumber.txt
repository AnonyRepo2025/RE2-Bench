1. __init__(name="John Doe", sex="Man") stores self.name = "John Doe" and self.sex = "Man".
2. _validate_phoneNumber("jgdjrj") checks if phoneNumber is not empty, has 11 characters and is all digits.
3. "jgdjrj" is not empty, has 6 characters and is not all digits.
4. Therefore, `_validate_phoneNumber("jgdjrj")` will return: None

1. isValid("()[]{}") checks if the string s is a valid parentheses.
2. The string s is "()[]{}".
3. The first character is "(", it is not in mapping, so it is appended to the stack.
4. The second character is ")", it is in mapping, so the top element of the stack is popped and compared with mapping[")"]. The top element is "(", so it is a valid parentheses.
5. The third character is "{", it is not in mapping, so it is appended to the stack.
6. The fourth character is "}", it is in mapping, so the top element of the stack is popped and compared with mapping["}"]. The top element is "{", so it is a valid parentheses.
7. The fifth character is "[", it is not in mapping, so it is appended to the stack.
8. The sixth character is "]", it is in mapping, so the top element of the stack is popped and compared with mapping["]"]. The top element is "[", so it is a valid parentheses.
9. The stack is empty, so the string s is a valid parentheses.
10. Therefore, `isValid("()[]{}")` will return: True
