1. The `add_employee` method is called with the following arguments: employee_id=1, name="John Doe", position="Manager", department="HR", salary=5000.
2. The `employee_id` 1 is already in the `employees` dictionary, so the method returns False.

1. The `isValid` method is called with the argument `s` = "()".
2. The first character is "(", which is not in the `mapping` dictionary, so it is appended to the `stack`.
3. The second character is ")", which is in the `mapping` dictionary, so the last element of the `stack` is popped and compared with the corresponding value in the `mapping` dictionary. They are the same, so the method continues.
4. The `stack` is empty, so the method returns `True`.
