Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The length of `first` is 3 and the length of `second` is 3, both are less than 10.
2. The loop iterates over the first 5 elements of `first` and `second`. Since `first` and `second` have different elements at the first index, the function returns 'no'.
3. The function does not reach the `first.extend(second)` line.
4. The output will be 'no'.

Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The length of `first` is 10 and the length of `second` is 10, both are greater than or equal to 10.
2. The loop iterates over the first 5 elements of `first` and `second`. Since `first` and `second` have the same elements at the first 5 indices, the function does not return 'no'.
3. The function reaches the `first.extend(second)` line. This line extends `first` with the elements of `second`.
4. The output will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
