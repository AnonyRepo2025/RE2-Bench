The function `generate_email_pattern` does not take any arguments. It simply returns a string that represents a regular expression pattern for matching email addresses.

The pattern is:

\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b

This pattern matches any string that:

- Starts with a word boundary (\\b)
- Followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens ([A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+)
- Followed by an at symbol (@)
- Followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens ([A-Za-z0-9.-]+)
- Followed by a dot (\\.)
- Followed by two or more alphabetic characters ([A-Z|a-z]{2,})
- Ends with a word boundary (\\b)

This pattern is commonly used in email validation.

[THOUGHT]
The function `isValid` checks if the input string `s` has valid parentheses.

The function works by iterating over each character in the string. If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it's in the `mapping` dictionary), the function checks if the top element of the `stack` (which is the last element added) is the corresponding opening bracket. If it's not, the function returns `False` because the parentheses are not valid. If it is, the function removes the top element from the stack.

If the character is not a closing bracket, it's an opening bracket and is added to the stack.

After all characters have been processed, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it's not, there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns `False`. If it is, all parentheses are matched and the function returns `True`.
