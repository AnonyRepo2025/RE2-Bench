Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input.
2. It initializes an empty string `out`.
3. It then iterates over each character in `text`.
4. If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase and appends it to `out`.
5. If the character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase and appends it to `out`.
6. Finally, it returns `out`.

What will be the output of `f` given the following input:

Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. If `n` is 0, it returns 0.
3. If `n` is 1, it returns 1.
4. If `n` is greater than 1, it returns the sum of `f(n-1)` and `f(n-2)`.
5. This is a recursive function, so it will keep calling itself with decreasing values of `n` until it reaches 0 or 1.
6. The Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
7. So `f(10)` will return the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is 55.
