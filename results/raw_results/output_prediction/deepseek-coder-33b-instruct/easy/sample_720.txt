Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `items` and `item`. `items` is a list of strings, and `item` is a string.
2. The while loop will keep popping the last element from `items` if it is equal to `item`. In this case, the last element is "n", which is equal to `item`, so it will keep popping.
3. After the while loop, the function appends `item` to `items`.
4. The function returns the length of `items`.
