Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `fish = chemicals[1:]` creates a new list `fish` that contains all elements of `chemicals` except the first one.
2. `chemicals.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in `chemicals`.
3. The for loop does not execute because `num` is 0.
4. `chemicals.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in `chemicals` back to its original order.
5. The function returns `chemicals`.

2. `chemicals.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in `chemicals`.

4. `chemicals.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in `chemicals` back to its original order.
5. The function returns `chemicals`.
