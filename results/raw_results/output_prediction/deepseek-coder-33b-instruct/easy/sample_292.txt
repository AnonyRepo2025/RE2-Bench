Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input.
2. The list comprehension `[c if c.isdigit() else '*' for c in text]` iterates over each character `c` in `text`. If `c` is a digit, it is added to the new list. If `c` is not a digit, '*' is added to the new list.
3. The `join` function concatenates all the characters in the list into a single string.
4. The output will be "*f**s**a*a", where '*' is used to replace non-digit characters.
