1. `update_product_quantity(product_id=1, quantity=-1)` is called.
2. `product_id` is 1 and `quantity` is -1.
3. `product_id` is in `self.inventory`, so `self.inventory[product_id]['quantity']` is 9.
4. `self.inventory[product_id]['quantity'] += quantity` is `9 += -1`, which is 8.
5. `self.inventory` is now `{"1": {"name": "product 3", "quantity": 8}}`.

1. `isValid("()[]{}")` is called.
2. `s` is "()[]{}".
3. `char` is '(', it's not in `mapping`, so `stack.append(char)` is called, `stack` is now ['('].
4. `char` is ')', it's in `mapping`, so `top_element = stack.pop()` is called, `top_element` is '(', `mapping[char]` is '(', they are equal, so nothing happens.
5. `char` is '[', it's not in `mapping`, so `stack.append(char)` is called, `stack` is now ['(', '['].
6. `char` is ']', it's in `mapping`, so `top_element = stack.pop()` is called, `top_element` is '[', `mapping[char]` is '[', they are equal, so nothing happens.
7. `char` is '{', it's not in `mapping`, so `stack.append(char)` is called, `stack` is now ['(', '[', '{'].
8. `char` is '}', it's in `mapping`, so `top_element = stack.pop()` is called, `top_element` is '{', `mapping[char]` is '{', they are equal, so nothing happens.
9. `stack` is not empty, so `not stack` is False.
10. `isValid("()[]{}")` returns False.
