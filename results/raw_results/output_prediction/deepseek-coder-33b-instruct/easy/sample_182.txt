The function `f` takes a dictionary as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair from the dictionary. The tuples are sorted by the keys.

1. The input dictionary `dic` is `{"b": 1, "a": 2}`.
2. The `sorted` function sorts the items of the dictionary. By default, it sorts by the first element of each tuple (the key in this case).
3. The output will be `[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]`.

The function `f` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that includes only the even numbers from the input list.

1. The input list `lst` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
2. The list comprehension `[i for i in lst if i % 2 == 0]` generates a new list that includes only the elements from `lst` that are divisible by 2 (i.e., the even numbers).
3. The output will be `[2, 4, 6]`.

The function `f` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that includes only the odd numbers from the input list.

1. The input list `lst` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
2. The list comprehension `[i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0]` generates a new list that includes only the elements from `lst` that are not divisible by 2 (i.e., the odd numbers).
