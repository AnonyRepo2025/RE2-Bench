Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The mean of the numbers is calculated as `sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`, which is `(1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 3 = 2.0`.
2. The mean absolute deviation is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean, divided by the number of numbers. The absolute differences are `abs(1.0 - 2.0) = 1.0`, `abs(2.0 - 2.0) = 0.0`, and `abs(3.0 - 2.0) = 1.0`.
3. The sum of these differences is `1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 = 2.0`.
4. Dividing this by the number of numbers (3) gives `2.0 / 3 = 0.6666666666666666`.
5. The return value will be `0.6666666666666666`.

    return s == s[::-1]

What will be the output of `is_palindrome` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```

    "inputs": {
        "s": "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
    }
}

}
```
[/STRUCTURE]

[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `s.lower()` converts all characters to lowercase. The input `s` becomes "a man, a plan, a canal: panama".
2. `''.join(c for c in s if c.isalnum())` removes all non-alphanumeric characters. The string becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama".
3. `s == s[::-1]` checks if the string is the same when reversed. "amanaplanacanalpanama" is the same as its reverse, so the return value will be `True`.

[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it returns 0.
2. If `n` is 1, it returns 1.
3. If `n` is greater than 1, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively.
4. It then enters a loop that runs `n - 1` times. In each iteration of the loop, it updates `a` and `b` to `b` and `a + b`, respectively.
5. After the loop, it returns `b`, which is the `n`th Fibonacci number.
6. The 10th Fibonacci number is 55.

3. If `n` is greater than 3, it checks if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If it is, it returns `False`.
4. If `n` is not divisible by 2 or 3, it enters a loop that runs while `i * i` is less than or equal to `n`. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. If it is, it returns `False`.
5. If `n` is not divisible by any number in the loop, it returns `True`.
