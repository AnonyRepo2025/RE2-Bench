1. The `__init__` method initializes an empty dictionary `self.employees`.
2. The `remove_employee` method takes an `employee_id` as an argument.
3. If the `employee_id` is in the `self.employees` dictionary, it removes the employee with that id from the dictionary and returns `True`.
4. If the `employee_id` is not in the `self.employees` dictionary, it does nothing and returns `False`.
5. In this case, the `employee_id` 2 is not in the `self.employees` dictionary, so the method returns `False`.

1. The `isValid` method takes a string `s` as an argument.
2. It initializes an empty list `stack` and a dictionary `mapping` with closing brackets as keys and opening brackets as values.
3. It iterates over each character `char` in the string `s`.
4. If `char` is a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, it pops the top element from the stack. If it is not, it returns `False`.
5. If `char` is not a closing bracket, it appends `char` to the stack.
6. After the loop, if the stack is empty, it returns `True`. If it is not, it returns `False`.
7. In this case, the string `s` is "()[]{}", which is a valid parentheses string, so the method returns `True`.
