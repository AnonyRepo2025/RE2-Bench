Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` takes a list of numbers as input.
2. It starts from the end of the list and goes to the beginning.
3. For each number, it checks if it is even.
4. If the number is even, it removes it from the list.
5. The function returns the modified list.

In the given input, the list is [5, 3, 3, 7].
1. The last number 7 is not even, so it is not removed.
2. The second number 3 is not even, so it is not removed.
3. The first number 5 is not even, so it is not removed.

So, the output will be [5, 3, 3, 7].
