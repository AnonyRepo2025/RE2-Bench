The function `f` takes a list and a function as arguments. It first makes a copy of the list, sorts the copy, applies the function to the copy, and then returns the original list.

The lambda function is defined as `operation = lambda x: x.reverse()`.

So, the function `f` will first make a copy of the list, sort it, reverse it, and then return the original list.

The sorted list is [2, 4, 6, 8, 15]. After reversing it, it becomes [15, 8, 6, 4, 2]. But the original list is not changed, so the output will be the original list [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].
