The `__mul__` method is called when the `*` operator is used on an instance of the class. In this case, `self` is an instance of `QuarterOffset` with `n`=1 and `other`=2.5.

The `__mul__` method returns a new instance of `QuarterOffset` with `n` equal to `other` times `self.n`.

So, `self.n * other` = 1 * 2.5 = 2.5.

Since `other` is a float, the `__mul__` method returns `NotImplemented`.
