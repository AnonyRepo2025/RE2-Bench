Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The code will read the input from console, so `x` will be `0`.
2. `x` is not equal to `1`, so it will go to the `else` branch.
3. The `print(1)` statement will be executed, so the output will be `1`.

Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The code will read the input from console, so `n` will be `10`.
2. `is_prime(n)` is called with `n` as `10`.
3. `10` is not a prime number, so the function will return `False`.
4. The `print(is_prime(n))` statement will print `False`.

1. The code will read the input from console, so `s` will be `A man a plan a canal Panama`.
2. `is_palindrome(s)` is called with `s` as `A man a plan a canal Panama`.
3. `s` is converted to lowercase and all spaces are removed. The result is `amanaplanacanalpanama`.
4. The `s == s[::-1]` check will compare `s` with its reverse. Since `amanaplanacanalpanama` is the same as its reverse, the function will return `True`.
5. The `print(is_palindrome(s))` statement will print `True`.
