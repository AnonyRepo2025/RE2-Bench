2. `set_city` sets `self.city` to "Beijing".
3. `set_city` does not return anything.

1. `isValid` is called with "()[]{}" as an argument.
2. `isValid` initializes an empty stack and a mapping dictionary.
3. `isValid` iterates over each character in the string.
4. For the first character "(", it is not in the mapping dictionary, so it is appended to the stack.
5. For the second character ")", it is in the mapping dictionary, so it checks if the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. It is, so it removes the top element from the stack.
6. For the third character "{", it is not in the mapping dictionary, so it is appended to the stack.
7. For the fourth character "}", it is in the mapping dictionary, so it checks if the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. It is, so it removes the top element from the stack.
8. For the fifth character "[", it is not in the mapping dictionary, so it is appended to the stack.
9. For the sixth character "]", it is in the mapping dictionary, so it checks if the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. It is, so it removes the top element from the stack.
10. After all characters have been processed, `isValid` checks if the stack is empty. It is, so it returns True.
