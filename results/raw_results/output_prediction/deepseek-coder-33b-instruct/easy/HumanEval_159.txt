Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `need` is 8 and `remaining` is 9. Since `need` is not less than or equal to `remaining`, the code inside the else branch is executed.
2. The function returns a list where the first element is the sum of `number` and `remaining` (which is 4 + 9 = 13), and the second element is 0 (since `need` is greater than `remaining`, the remaining amount is 0).
