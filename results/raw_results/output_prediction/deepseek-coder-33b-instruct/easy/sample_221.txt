Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `text.split(delim)` splits the string `text` into a list of substrings using `delim` as the delimiter. In this case, `delim` is ".", so the string "bpxa24fc5." will be split into ["bpxa24fc5", ""] (an empty string).
2. The first element of the list is assigned to `first`, and the second element (which is an empty string) is assigned to `second`.
3. The function returns `second + delim + first`. Since `second` is an empty string, and `delim` is ".", the return value will be ".bpxa24fc5".

Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `x[::-1]` is a slice that starts at the end of the list, ends at position 0, and moves with the step -1 (which means one step backwards). So the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] will be reversed to [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
2. The return value will be [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
