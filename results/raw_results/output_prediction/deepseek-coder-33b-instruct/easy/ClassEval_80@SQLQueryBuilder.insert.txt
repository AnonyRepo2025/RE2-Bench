1. insert(table="users", data={"name": "Tom", "age": 30, "region": "USA"})
2. keys = ', '.join(data.keys()) will join the keys of the dictionary with a comma and a space.
3. values = ', '.join((f"'{v}'" for v in data.values())) will join the values of the dictionary with a comma and a space, each value is enclosed in single quotes.
4. The final SQL query will be: "INSERT INTO users (name, age, region) VALUES ('Tom', '30', 'USA')"

3. For each character, if it is a closing bracket, it is checked if the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket.
4. If it is not, False is returned.
5. If it is, the top element is removed from the stack.
6. If the character is an opening bracket, it is added to the stack.
7. If the stack is empty at the end, True is returned. Otherwise, False is returned.
