Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` takes a string `name` as an argument.
2. The function returns a list with two elements: the first character of `name` and the last character of `name` reversed.
3. The first character of `name` is "m", and the last character of `name` reversed is ".".
4. The return value will be ["m", "."].
