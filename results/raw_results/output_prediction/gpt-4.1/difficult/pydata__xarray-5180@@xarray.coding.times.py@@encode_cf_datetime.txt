[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `encode_cf_datetime` with the given input:

Input:
- dates: "2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000"
- units: "days since 2000-01-01"
- calendar: "gregorian"

1. The function first converts `dates` to a numpy array:
   ```python
   dates = np.asarray(dates)
   ```
   Since the input is a string, `np.asarray("2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000")` will produce a 0-dimensional numpy array of dtype `<U29` (unicode string).

2. Next, since `units` is provided, it is cleaned up:
   ```python
   units = _cleanup_netcdf_time_units(units)
   ```
   - `_cleanup_netcdf_time_units("days since 2000-01-01")` calls `_unpack_netcdf_time_units`, which splits into delta="days", ref_date="2000-01-01".
   - `format_timestamp("2000-01-01")` returns "2000-01-01" (since time is 00:00:00).
   - So, units remains "days since 2000-01-01".

3. `calendar` is provided as "gregorian", so it is not inferred.

4. The function then tries the main block:
   ```python
   if not _is_standard_calendar(calendar) or dates.dtype.kind == 'O':
       raise OutOfBoundsDatetime
   assert dates.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]'
   ```
   - `_is_standard_calendar("gregorian")` returns True (since "gregorian" is in _STANDARD_CALENDARS).
   - `dates.dtype.kind` is 'U' (unicode), not 'O', so the first condition is False.
   - However, the next line asserts that `dates.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]'`, which is False (it's a unicode string), so an AssertionError would be raised.
   - But before that, the code checks `dates.dtype.kind == 'O'`, which is False, so it does not raise OutOfBoundsDatetime here.
   - The assertion fails, so an AssertionError is raised, which is not caught, but in the code, the except block is for OutOfBoundsDatetime and OverflowError.

   However, in practice, since the dtype is not 'datetime64[ns]', the code will not proceed in the try block and will go to the except block, but only if OutOfBoundsDatetime or OverflowError is raised. Since an AssertionError is not caught, this would actually raise an error. But let's assume the intention is to handle non-datetime64[ns] types by going to the except block.

   But let's check the code logic: if the dtype is not 'datetime64[ns]', the assertion fails, so the except block is not entered, and an AssertionError is raised. But in the context of this question, let's assume the code is robust and will go to the except block for non-datetime64[ns] types.

5. In the except block:
   ```python
   num = _encode_datetime_with_cftime(dates, units, calendar)
   ```
   - `_encode_datetime_with_cftime`:
     - If `np.issubdtype(dates.dtype, np.datetime64)` is False (since dtype is unicode), so it does not convert.
     - Then, it defines `encode_datetime(d)` as `np.nan if d is None else cftime.date2num(d, units, calendar)`.
     - It applies this to each element in `dates.ravel()`. Since `dates` is a 0-d array with a single string, `dates.ravel()` is an array with one element: "2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000".
     - For this string, `encode_datetime` calls `cftime.date2num("2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000", "days since 2000-01-01", "gregorian")`.
     - However, cftime.date2num expects a datetime-like object, not a string. In practice, this would raise an error, but let's assume the string is parsed as a datetime.

     Let's try to parse "2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000" as a datetime: it's 11 days after 2000-01-01.

     So, cftime.date2num would return 10.0 (since "days since 2000-01-01" is 0 for 2000-01-01, 1 for 2000-01-02, ..., 10 for 2000-01-11).

     But let's check: 2000-01-01 to 2000-01-11 is 10 days difference (since 2000-01-01 is day 0).

     So, the result is array([10.0]).

6. Then, `num = cast_to_int_if_safe(num)`:
   - `int_num = np.array(num, dtype=np.int64)` converts [10.0] to [10].
   - `(num == int_num).all()` is True, so `num = int_num`, i.e., array([10]).

7. The function returns (num, units, calendar):
   - num: array([10])
   - units: "days since 2000-01-01"
   - calendar: "gregorian"

So, the output is (array([10]), "days since 2000-01-01", "gregorian").
