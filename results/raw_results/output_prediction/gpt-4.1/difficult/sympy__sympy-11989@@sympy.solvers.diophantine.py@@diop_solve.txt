Let's step through the execution of `diop_solve(eq)` for eq = "2*x - 3*y - 5".

1. The input is a string: "2*x - 3*y - 5". In practice, sympy expects a sympy expression, so let's assume eq is sympy's `2*x - 3*y - 5` (with x and y as symbols).

2. The function first calls `classify_diop(eq, _dict=False)`.

3. In `classify_diop`:
   - `var = list(eq.free_symbols)` → [x, y]
   - `var.sort(key=default_sort_key)` → [x, y] (alphabetical)
   - `eq = eq.expand(force=True)` → 2*x - 3*y - 5
   - `coeff = eq.as_coefficients_dict()`:
     - 2*x: coefficient 2
     - -3*y: coefficient -3
     - -5: constant term, key 1, value -5
     So: {x: 2, y: -3, 1: -5}
   - All coefficients are integers.
   - `total_degree = Poly(eq).total_degree()`:
     - 2*x: degree 1
     - -3*y: degree 1
     - -5: degree 0
     So, total_degree = 1
   - `homogeneous = 1 not in coeff` → 1 is in coeff, so homogeneous = False
   - Since total_degree == 1, diop_type = 'linear'
   - Returns ([x, y], coeff, 'linear'), where coeff is a defaultdict (since _dict=False).

4. Back in `diop_solve`, since eq_type == 'linear', it calls `_diop_linear(var, coeff, param)`.

5. `_diop_linear` solves equations of the form a*x + b*y = c.
   - Our equation: 2*x - 3*y - 5 = 0 → 2*x - 3*y = 5
   - So, a = 2, b = -3, c = 5
   - The general solution for 2*x - 3*y = 5 is:
     - Find particular solution (x0, y0) and parameterize the general solution.
     - The general solution is:
       x = x0 + (b/d)*t
       y = y0 - (a/d)*t
       where d = gcd(a, b)
     - a = 2, b = -3, d = gcd(2, 3) = 1

   - Use extended Euclidean algorithm to solve 2*x - 3*y = 5.
     - Let's solve 2*x - 3*y = 5 for integer solutions.

   - Let's use the standard method:
     - 2*x - 3*y = 5
     - 2*x = 5 + 3*y
     - x = (5 + 3*y)/2
     - For integer x, (5 + 3*y) must be even.
     - 3*y must be odd (since 5 is odd, even + odd = odd).
     - 3*y is odd when y is odd.
     - So, y = 2*t + 1, t ∈ ℤ

     - Plug y = 2*t + 1 into x:
       x = (5 + 3*(2*t + 1))/2 = (5 + 6*t + 3)/2 = (8 + 6*t)/2 = 4 + 3*t

     - So, the general solution is:
       y = 2*t + 1
       x = 4 + 3*t

   - So, the set of integer solutions is:
     (x, y) = (4 + 3*t, 2*t + 1), t ∈ ℤ

   - In sympy, the output is usually a set of tuples with the parameter t (often as a symbol).

   - So, the output is:
     { (4 + 3*t, 2*t + 1) }

   - In JSON, we can represent this as a string, or as a set with a tuple of expressions.

   - Since the output structure is:
     {
         "output": XXX
     }
     Let's use the string representation as sympy would print it:
     "{(4 + 3*t, 2*t + 1)}"
