[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step for input "thirty-two".

1. The input string is "thirty-two".
2. The function replaces '-' with ' ', so textnum becomes "thirty two".
3. Initialize: current = 0, result = 0, curstring = '', onnumber = False.
4. Split into words: ["thirty", "two"]

First word: "thirty"
- Not in ordinal_words.
- Check ordinal_endings: "thirty" does not end with "ieth" or "th".
- "thirty" is in numwords: (1, 30)
- scale = 1, increment = 30
- current = current * scale + increment = 0 * 1 + 30 = 30
- scale is not > 100, so result unchanged.
- onnumber = True

Second word: "two"
- Not in ordinal_words.
- Check ordinal_endings: "two" does not end with "ieth" or "th".
- "two" is in numwords: (1, 2)
- scale = 1, increment = 2
- current = current * scale + increment = 30 * 1 + 2 = 32
- scale is not > 100, so result unchanged.
- onnumber = True

After the loop, onnumber is True, so curstring += repr(result + current) = repr(0 + 32) = '32'
Return curstring, which is '32'.
