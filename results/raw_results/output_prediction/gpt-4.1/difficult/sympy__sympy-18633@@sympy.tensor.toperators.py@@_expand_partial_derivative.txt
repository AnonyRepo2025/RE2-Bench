[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the input and the code step by step.

1. The method being called is `_expand_partial_derivative` on an instance of `PartialDerivative`.
2. The input object has `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` all set to null, but these are not used directly in the method; instead, the method recomputes them.
3. The method starts by calling `self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)`.
   - `self.expr` is `self.args[0]`
   - `self.variables` is `self.args[1:]`
   - But the input does not provide `args`, so we must assume that `self.args` is empty or not set.
   - However, in SymPy, if an attribute is not set, it may raise an error, but for the sake of this simulation, let's assume `self.args` is empty, so `self.expr` and `self.variables` are not defined.
   - If `self.args` is empty, then `self.expr` will raise an IndexError.
   - But let's suppose the code is being called on a valid PartialDerivative object, and the input is just showing the internal state, not the actual arguments.
   - In that case, the method will call `_contract_indices_for_derivative` with the current expr and variables.

4. `_contract_indices_for_derivative` returns `args, indices, free, dum`.
5. Then, `obj = self.func(*args)` creates a new PartialDerivative with those arguments.
6. Then, `obj._indices = indices`, etc.
7. Then, `result = obj`.
8. The next check is: `if not args[0].free_symbols: return S.Zero`
   - If the first argument (the expr) has no free symbols, return 0.
   - Otherwise, if `obj.expr` is a `TensAdd`, it recursively expands.
   - If `obj.expr` is a `TensMul` and there is only one variable, it does a product rule expansion.
   - Otherwise, it applies the derivative recursively for each variable.

But since the input does not provide any information about the actual expression or variables, and only gives the internal state, the only thing the method can do is recompute `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` using `_contract_indices_for_derivative`.

Therefore, the output will be:
- `_indices`: whatever is returned by `_contract_indices_for_derivative`
- `_free`: same
- `_dum`: same

But since the input does not provide any information about the expression or variables, we cannot compute the actual values. In this case, the output should be the same as the input: all nulls, or perhaps empty lists if the method is called on an empty PartialDerivative.

But in the code, after calling `_contract_indices_for_derivative`, it sets `obj._indices = indices`, etc., so the output will be whatever is returned by `_contract_indices_for_derivative`.

If there are no arguments, then `args` is empty, so `indices`, `free`, and `dum` will be empty lists.

Therefore, the output is:
```
{
    "_indices": [],
    "_free": [],
    "_dum": []
}
```
