[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `_osborne(e, d)` with the given input.

Input:
- e = "2*sinh(2)" (as a string, but in the code, e is expected to be a SymPy expression)
- d is not provided in the input, but in the code, d is a required argument. However, in the function definition, d is required, but the input only provides "e". This suggests that perhaps d=1 is assumed (since the function is often used with d=1).

Assume d=1.

First, e = 2*sinh(2). In SymPy, this would be: Mul(2, sinh(2))

The function `bottom_up(e, f)` applies f to all subexpressions of e, starting from the leaves.

The function f(rv):
- If rv is not a HyperbolicFunction, return rv.
- If rv is a HyperbolicFunction, then:
    - a = rv.args[0]
    - a = a * d (since a is not an Add)
    - If rv.func is sinh: return I * sin(a)
    - If rv.func is cosh: return cos(a)
    - etc.

So, let's walk through bottom_up(2*sinh(2), f):

- The expression tree is Mul(2, sinh(2))
- bottom_up will first process the leaves: 2 and sinh(2)
    - 2: not a HyperbolicFunction, so f(2) = 2
    - sinh(2): is a HyperbolicFunction (sinh)
        - a = 2
        - a * d = 2 * 1 = 2
        - rv.func is sinh, so return I * sin(2)
    - So, f(sinh(2)) = I * sin(2)
- Now, the parent node is Mul(2, sinh(2)), but after bottom_up, the children are 2 and I * sin(2), so the new expression is 2 * I * sin(2)

So, the output is 2*I*sin(2)
