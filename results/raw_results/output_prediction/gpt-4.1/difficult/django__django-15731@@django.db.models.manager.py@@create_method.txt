[THOUGHT]
The function in question is `create_method`, which is defined inside the `_get_queryset_methods` classmethod of `BaseManager`. Its signature is:

```python
def create_method(name, method):
    @wraps(method)
    def manager_method(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return getattr(self.get_queryset(), name)(*args, **kwargs)
    return manager_method
```

Given the input:
- name = "values_list"
- method = {} (but in reality, this would be a function, but for the structure, it's just a placeholder)

The function `create_method` returns a function `manager_method` that is decorated with `@wraps(method)`. The `@wraps` decorator sets the `__wrapped__` attribute of the returned function to the original `method` argument.

So, the output structure is:
```
{
    "__wrapped__": {}
}
```
where the value of `__wrapped__` is the same as the input `method`, which is `{}`.
