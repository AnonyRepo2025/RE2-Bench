[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the execution of `_matrix_derivative(expr, x)` with the given input.

1. The input `expr` is a 2x2 matrix (ImmutableDenseMatrix) with `_rows`=2, `_cols`=2, and `_mat`=null (we'll assume it's a symbolic matrix with entries that depend on `x`).
2. The function `_matrix_derivative` calls `expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)`.
   - This returns a list of "lines", each being a list of expressions representing the derivative structure.
   - For a matrix, this typically returns a single line: [S.One, S.One], higher=expr._eval_derivative(x)
3. The function then builds each line: `parts = [i.build() for i in lines]`.
   - Each part is a list of expressions, but for a matrix, this will be a list containing the derivative matrix.
4. Then, `parts = [[convert_array_to_matrix(j) for j in i] for i in parts]`.
   - This step ensures all elements are matrix expressions.
5. The function defines `_get_shape(elem)` to get the shape of each element.
   - For a matrix, this will return (2,2).
6. It computes the rank: `get_rank(parts)` counts how many elements in the shape are not 1 or None.
   - For a 2x2 matrix, rank=2.
7. Since rank <= 2, it proceeds to contract one dims: `Add.fromiter([contract_one_dims(i) for i in parts])`.
   - For a single part, `contract_one_dims` just returns the matrix itself.
8. So the result is just the derivative matrix.

Now, let's look at how the derivative is computed for a matrix:
- `expr._eval_derivative(x)` calls `self.applyfunc(lambda x: x.diff(arg))`
- This applies the derivative to each element of the matrix.
- The output is a new 2x2 matrix, where each entry is the derivative of the corresponding entry of the original matrix with respect to `x`.

Since the input matrix's `_mat` is null, but the structure expects us to fill in the output matrix, let's assume the input matrix is:
| a11(x)  a12(x) |
| a21(x)  a22(x) |

Then the output will be:
| d(a11)/dx  d(a12)/dx |
| d(a21)/dx  d(a22)/dx |

But since we don't have the actual entries, the output will be a 2x2 matrix with each entry being the derivative of the corresponding input entry with respect to `x`.

So, the output structure will be:
{
    "_rows": 2,
    "_cols": 2,
    "_mat": [
        "diff(a11, x)", "diff(a12, x)",
        "diff(a21, x)", "diff(a22, x)"
    ]
}

But since the input `_mat` is null, and the function just applies `.diff(x)` to each entry, the output `_mat` will also be null (since we don't have the actual data).

Therefore, the output is:
{
    "_rows": 2,
    "_cols": 2,
    "_mat": null
}
