Let's step through the function `_sqlite_datetime_parse` with the given input:

Input:
- dt = "2016-06-13 00:00:00"
- tzname = "UTC"
- conn_tzname = "UTC"

1. The function first checks if `dt` is None. It is not.
2. It tries to parse `dt` using `backend_utils.typecast_timestamp(dt)`.
   - dt = "2016-06-13 00:00:00"
   - In `typecast_timestamp`, since ' ' is in dt, it splits into d = "2016-06-13", t = "00:00:00"
   - No '-' or '+' in t, so t remains "00:00:00"
   - dates = ["2016", "06", "13"]
   - times = ["00", "00", "00"]
   - seconds = "00"
   - No '.' in seconds, so microseconds = "0"
   - tzinfo = utc if settings.USE_TZ else None (let's assume USE_TZ is True, so tzinfo = utc)
   - Returns: datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)
3. Now, dt is a timezone-aware datetime in UTC.
4. Next, if conn_tzname is set, it does: dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.timezone(conn_tzname))
   - conn_tzname = "UTC", so dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.timezone("UTC"))
   - This is redundant, but dt is now a datetime with tzinfo=pytz.UTC.
5. Next, if tzname is not None and tzname != conn_tzname:
   - tzname = "UTC", conn_tzname = "UTC", so this is False. This block is skipped.
6. Returns dt.

So the output is a datetime object: 2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00 (with tzinfo UTC).

In JSON, this is usually represented as "2016-06-13T00:00:00+00:00".
