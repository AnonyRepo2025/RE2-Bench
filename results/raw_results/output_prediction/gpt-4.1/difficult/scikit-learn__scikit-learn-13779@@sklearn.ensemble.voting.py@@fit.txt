[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code for the `fit` method of `_BaseVoting` with the given input.

1. The input `self` has `"estimators": null`. This means `self.estimators` is `None`.
2. The first check in `fit` is:
   ```
   if self.estimators is None or len(self.estimators) == 0:
       raise AttributeError('Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples')
   ```
   Since `self.estimators` is `None`, this condition is true.
3. Therefore, the function will immediately raise an `AttributeError` with the message: "Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples".
4. The function will not proceed further, so no attributes like `estimators_` or `named_estimators_` will be set.

However, the output structure expects us to fill in the values for all the fields, but since the function raises an exception, the output should reflect that the function did not complete successfully.

But according to the instructions, I am to "predict output variable values to fill out placeholders XXX in the structure", so I should fill in the values as they would be at the point of exception (i.e., before any changes are made).

So, the output should be:
- "estimators": null
- "voting": "soft"
- "weights": null
- "n_jobs": null
- "flatten_transform": true
- "le_": { "classes_": "[0 1 2]" }
- "classes_": "[0 1 2]"
- "estimators_": null (not set)
- "named_estimators_": {} (empty dict, not set)

But since the function raises an exception, the output should reflect the state before the exception, i.e., the input values, and `estimators_` is not set.
