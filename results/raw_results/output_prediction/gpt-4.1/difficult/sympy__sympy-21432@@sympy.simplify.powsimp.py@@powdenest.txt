[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function powdenest with the given input:

- eq = "_x" (as a string, but in sympy context, this would be a symbol, so let's assume it's sympy.Symbol('_x'))
- force = False
- polar = False

1. The function first checks if force is True. It is not, so this block is skipped.
2. Next, it checks if polar is True. It is not, so this block is skipped.
3. Then, it does: new = powsimp(sympify(eq))
   - sympify("_x") returns Symbol('_x')
   - powsimp(Symbol('_x')) returns Symbol('_x') (since it's just a symbol, nothing to simplify)
4. Then, it does: return new.xreplace(Transform(_denest_pow, filter=lambda m: m.is_Pow or isinstance(m, exp)))
   - new is Symbol('_x'), which is not a Pow or exp, so the Transform does nothing.
   - So, the result is Symbol('_x')

So the output is just "_x" (as a sympy symbol, but in JSON, we represent it as a string).
