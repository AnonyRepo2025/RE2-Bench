[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step.

1. The method called is move(state, direction="left").
2. The state is:
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [7, 8, 0],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
3. First, find_blank(state) is called to find the position of 0 (the blank).
   - Row 0: [1, 6, 2] → no 0
   - Row 1: [7, 8, 0] → 0 is at index 2, so (i, j) = (1, 2)
4. Copy the state to new_state (deep copy).
5. The direction is "left".
   - The code for "left" is:
     new_state[i][j], new_state[i][j - 1] = (new_state[i][j - 1], new_state[i][j])
   - i = 1, j = 2
   - new_state[1][2], new_state[1][1] = new_state[1][1], new_state[1][2]
   - new_state[1][2] is 0, new_state[1][1] is 8
   - Swap them:
     new_state[1][2] = 8
     new_state[1][1] = 0
6. The resulting new_state is:
Row 0: [1, 6, 2] (unchanged)
Row 1: [7, 0, 8] (after swap)
Row 2: [4, 5, 3] (unchanged)

So the output is:
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [7, 0, 8],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
