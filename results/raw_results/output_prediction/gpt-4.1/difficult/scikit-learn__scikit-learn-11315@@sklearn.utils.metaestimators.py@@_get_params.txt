[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the execution of `_get_params(attr="_transformers", deep=True)` for the given input.

1. The method starts by calling `super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)`. This is `BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=True)`.

2. In `BaseEstimator.get_params`, it calls `self._get_param_names()`. This inspects the `__init__` signature of the class. Let's assume the class has parameters: `transformers`, `remainder`, `n_jobs`, `transformer_weights`.

3. For each parameter, it gets the value from `self`:
   - `transformers`: null
   - `remainder`: {"with_mean": true, "with_std": false, "copy": true}
   - `n_jobs`: 1
   - `transformer_weights`: null

4. For each parameter, if `deep` is True and the value has a `get_params` method, it recursively gets its parameters and adds them as `param__subparam`.

   - For `remainder`, which is a dict, it does not have a `get_params` method, so it is just added as is.
   - For the others, they are either null or int, so no recursion.

5. So, after `get_params`, `out` is:
   ```
   {
     "transformers": null,
     "remainder": {"with_mean": true, "with_std": false, "copy": true},
     "n_jobs": 1,
     "transformer_weights": null
   }
   ```

6. Now, back in `_get_params`, since `deep` is True, it continues.

7. It gets `estimators = getattr(self, attr)`, which is `self._transformers`. But in the input, there is no `_transformers` attribute, only `transformers`. But in sklearn, `_transformers` is usually a property that returns a list of (name, estimator) tuples. Since `transformers` is null, `_transformers` would be an empty list.

8. It updates `out` with `estimators`, but since `estimators` is empty, nothing is added.

9. Then, for each (name, estimator) in `estimators`, it would check if `estimator` has `get_params` and add its params, but again, since `estimators` is empty, nothing happens.

10. So, the final output is:
   ```
   {
     "transformers": null,
     "remainder": {"with_mean": true, "with_std": false, "copy": true},
     "n_jobs": 1,
     "transformer_weights": null
   }
   ```

11. The output structure asks for:
   - "n_jobs": XXX,
   - "remainder__copy": XXX,
   - "remainder__with_mean": XXX,
   - "remainder__with_std": XXX,
   - "remainder": { ... },
   - "transformer_weights": XXX,
   - "transformers": XXX,
   - "trans1": XXX

12. In the output from `get_params`, there are no keys like "remainder__copy", etc., because `remainder` is a dict, not an estimator with `get_params`. So those keys would not be present, but the structure requires them.

13. For "trans1", there is no such key in the output, so it should be null.

14. For "remainder__copy", "remainder__with_mean", "remainder__with_std", since `remainder` is a dict, and not an estimator, these keys would not be present in the output. But the structure requires them, so they should be null.

15. So, the filled structure is:
   - "n_jobs": 1
   - "remainder__copy": null
   - "remainder__with_mean": null
   - "remainder__with_std": null
   - "remainder": {"with_mean": true, "with_std": false, "copy": true}
   - "transformer_weights": null
   - "transformers": null
   - "trans1": null
