[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the code step by step.

1. The code builds a list `li` by iterating `i` from 1 to 370 (inclusive).
2. For each `i`, it counts the number of digits (`count`).
   - If `count == 1` (i.e., 1-9), it appends `i` itself to `li`.
   - If `count == 2` (i.e., 10-99), it splits the number into its digits and appends them (in order) to `li`.
   - If `count == 3` (i.e., 100-370), it splits the number into its digits and appends them (in order) to `li`.
3. After the loop, it pops the last two elements from `li`.
4. It reads an integer `n` from input, and prints `li[n-1]`.

Let's break down the construction of `li`:

- For i = 1 to 9: li = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
- For i = 10: temp = [0,1] (reversed to [1,0]), li += [1,0]
- For i = 11: temp = [1,1], li += [1,1]
- For i = 12: temp = [2,1], li += [1,2]
- ...
- For i = 99: temp = [9,9], li += [9,9]
- For i = 100: temp = [0,0,1], li += [1,0,0]
- For i = 101: temp = [1,0,1], li += [1,0,1]
- ...
- For i = 370: temp = [0,7,3], li += [3,7,0]

So, the list `li` is the concatenation of:
- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
- [1,0,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,4,1,5,1,6,1,7,1,8,1,9,2,0,2,1,2,2,2,3,2,4,2,5,2,6,2,7,2,8,2,9,3,0,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,4,3,5,3,6,3,7,3,8,3,9,4,0,4,1,4,2,4,3,4,4,4,5,4,6,4,7,4,8,4,9,5,0,5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4,5,5,5,6,5,7,5,8,5,9,6,0,6,1,6,2,6,3,6,4,6,5,6,6,6,7,6,8,6,9,7,0,7,1,7,2,7,3,7,4,7,5,7,6,7,7,7,8,7,9,8,0,8,1,8,2,8,3,8,4,8,5,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,9,9,0,9,1,9,2,9,3,9,4,9,5,9,6,9,7,9,8,9,9]
- [1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,2,1,0,3,1,0,4,1,0,5,1,0,6,1,0,7,1,0,8,1,0,9,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,1,1,4,1,1,5,1,1,6,1,1,7,1,1,8,1,1,9,1,2,0,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,3,1,2,4,1,2,5,1,2,6,1,2,7,1,2,8,1,2,9,1,3,0,1,3,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,4,1,3,5,1,3,6,1,3,7,1,3,8,1,3,9,1,4,0,1,4,1,1,4,2,1,4,3,1,4,4,1,4,5,1,4,6,1,4,7,1,4,8,1,4,9,1,5,0,1,5,1,1,5,2,1,5,3,1,5,4,1,5,5,1,5,6,1,5,7,1,5,8,1,5,9,1,6,0,1,6,1,1,6,2,1,6,3,1,6,4,1,6,5,1,6,6,1,6,7,1,6,8,1,6,9,1,7,0,1,7,1,1,7,2,1,7,3,1,7,4,1,7,5,1,7,6,1,7,7,1,7,8,1,7,9,1,8,0,1,8,1,1,8,2,1,8,3,1,8,4,1,8,5,1,8,6,1,8,7,1,8,8,1,8,9,1,9,0,1,9,1,1,9,2,1,9,3,1,9,4,1,9,5,1,9,6,1,9,7,1,9,8,1,9,9,2,0,0,2,0,1,2,0,2,2,0,3,2,0,4,2,0,5,2,0,6,2,0,7,2,0,8,2,0,9,2,1,0,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,3,2,1,4,2,1,5,2,1,6,2,1,7,2,1,8,2,1,9,2,2,0,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,4,2,2,5,2,2,6,2,2,7,2,2,8,2,2,9,2,3,0,2,3,1,2,3,2,2,3,3,2,3,4,2,3,5,2,3,6,2,3,7,2,3,8,2,3,9,2,4,0,2,4,1,2,4,2,2,4,3,2,4,4,2,4,5,2,4,6,2,4,7,2,4,8,2,4,9,2,5,0,2,5,1,2,5,2,2,5,3,2,5,4,2,5,5,2,5,6,2,5,7,2,5,8,2,5,9,2,6,0,2,6,1,2,6,2,2,6,3,2,6,4,2,6,5,2,6,6,2,6,7,2,6,8,2,6,9,2,7,0,2,7,1,2,7,2,2,7,3,2,7,4,2,7,5,2,7,6,2,7,7,2,7,8,2,7,9,2,8,0,2,8,1,2,8,2,2,8,3,2,8,4,2,8,5,2,8,6,2,8,7,2,8,8,2,8,9,2,9,0,2,9,1,2,9,2,2,9,3,2,9,4,2,9,5,2,9,6,2,9,7,2,9,8,2,9,9,3,0,0,3,0,1,3,0,2,3,0,3,3,0,4,3,0,5,3,0,6,3,0,7,3,0,8,3,0,9,3,1,0,3,1,1,3,1,2,3,1,3,3,1,4,3,1,5,3,1,6,3,1,7,3,1,8,3,1,9,3,2,0,3,2,1,3,2,2,3,2,3,3,2,4,3,2,5,3,2,6,3,2,7,3,2,8,3,2,9,3,3,0,3,3,1,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,5,3,3,6,3,3,7,3,3,8,3,3,9,3,4,0,3,4,1,3,4,2,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,4,5,3,4,6,3,4,7,3,4,8,3,4,9,3,5,0,3,5,1,3,5,2,3,5,3,3,5,4,3,5,5,3,5,6,3,5,7,3,5,8,3,5,9,3,6,0,3,6,1,3,6,2,3,6,3,3,6,4,3,6,5,3,6,6,3,6,7,3,6,8,3,6,9,3,7,0]

But let's not write the whole list, let's instead compute the length and the 423rd element.

Let's simulate the list up to the 423rd element.

First, for i = 1 to 9: 9 elements.
For i = 10 to 99: 90 numbers, each gives 2 digits, so 90*2 = 180 elements.
For i = 100 to 370: 271 numbers, each gives 3 digits, so 271*3 = 813 elements.

Total before popping: 9 + 180 + 813 = 1002 elements.
After popping two: 1000 elements.

Now, let's find the 423rd element (li[422]).

Let's see how the list is constructed up to that point.

- First 9 elements: 1-9
- Next 180 elements: digits of 10-99

So, after 9 elements, the next 180 elements are from 10 to 99.

Let's see where the 423rd element falls.

First 9 elements: 1-9
Next 180 elements: positions 10 to 189 (inclusive)
So, after 189 elements, we have covered up to li[188].

Now, from li[189] onwards, we have the 3-digit numbers.

So, li[189] is the first digit of 100.

So, the 3-digit numbers start at li[189].

So, li[189] is the first digit of 100.

Now, let's find which 3-digit number contains the 423rd element.

li[189] is the first digit of 100.

So, the offset is 423 - 189 = 234

So, the 234th element in the 3-digit numbers.

Each 3-digit number gives 3 elements.

So, which 3-digit number is it?

234 // 3 = 78 full numbers, with a remainder of 0.

So, after 78 full 3-digit numbers, we reach the 234th element.

So, the 78th 3-digit number after 100 is:

First 3-digit number: 100
So, 100 + 78 - 1 = 177

So, the 78th 3-digit number is 177.

Now, let's check the position within 177.

234 % 3 = 0, so it's the last digit of the previous number.

But let's check carefully.

li[189] = 1 (100)
li[190] = 0 (100)
li[191] = 0 (100)
li[192] = 1 (101)
li[193] = 0 (101)
li[194] = 1 (101)
...

So, the first 3-digit number (100) gives li[189], li[190], li[191]
Second (101): li[192], li[193], li[194]
...
So, the nth 3-digit number starts at li[189 + (n-1)*3]

So, for the 78th 3-digit number:
Start index = 189 + (78-1)*3 = 189 + 231 = 420

So, li[420] = first digit of 177
li[421] = second digit of 177
li[422] = third digit of 177

So, li[422] is the third digit of 177, which is 7.

Therefore, the output is 7.
