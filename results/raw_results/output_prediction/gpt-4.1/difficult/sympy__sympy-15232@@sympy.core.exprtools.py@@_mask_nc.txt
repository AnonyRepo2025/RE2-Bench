[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `_mask_nc` with the input `eq = x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n`.

First, note that the input is a string, but the function expects a SymPy expression. Let's assume that the input is already a SymPy expression (otherwise, it would need to be sympified).

1. The function checks if `expr.is_commutative`. For the expression `x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n`, if all symbols are commutative, this will be True, and the function will return `(eq, {}, [])`.

2. However, if any of the symbols are non-commutative, then the function will proceed to mask them.

But in the input, there is no indication that any of the symbols are non-commutative. In SymPy, by default, symbols are commutative unless specified otherwise.

So, unless the input symbols are non-commutative, the function will return `(eq, {}, [])`.

Therefore, the output will be:
{
    "output": ["x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n", {}, []]
}
But since the input is a string, and the function expects a SymPy expression, the output will be the same string, unless sympify is called.

Assuming the input is a SymPy expression, the output will be the same expression, an empty dict, and an empty list.
