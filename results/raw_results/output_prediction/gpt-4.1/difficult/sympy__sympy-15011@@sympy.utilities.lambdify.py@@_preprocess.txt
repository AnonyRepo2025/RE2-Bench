[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the `_preprocess` method with the given input.

- `self._dummify` is False.
- `args` is an empty list: `[]`
- `expr` is the string `"x**2"`

Step 1: The method checks if `dummify` is set. If not, it sets `dummify` to True if any element in `flatten(args)` is a Dummy. But since `args` is empty, `flatten(args)` is also empty, so `any(...)` is False. So `dummify` remains False.

Step 2: It initializes `argstrs` as an empty list.

Step 3: It iterates over `args`, but since `args` is empty, the loop does nothing.

Step 4: It returns `(argstrs, expr)`, which is `([], "x**2")`.

So the output is a tuple: ([], "x**2").
