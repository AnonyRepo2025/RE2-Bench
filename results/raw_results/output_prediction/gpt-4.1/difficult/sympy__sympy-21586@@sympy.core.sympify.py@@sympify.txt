[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function sympify with input a="{2.0, 3}".

1. is_sympy = getattr(a, '__sympy__', None) → a is a string, so is_sympy is None.
2. isinstance(a, CantSympify) → CantSympify is not defined here, but a is a string, so this is False.
3. cls = getattr(a, '__class__', None) → cls = str.
4. conv = converter.get(cls, None) → converter is empty, so conv is None.
5. for superclass in getmro(cls): ... → converter is empty, so nothing happens.
6. if cls is type(None): ... → False.
7. if evaluate is None: ... → not relevant, as not used yet.
8. if _is_numpy_instance(a): ... → not defined, but a is a string, so likely False.
9. _sympy_ = getattr(a, '_sympy_', None) → a is a string, so _sympy_ is None.
10. if not strict: ... → strict is False by default, but a is a string, so flat/shape not relevant.
11. if not isinstance(a, str): ... → a is a string, so skip.
12. if strict: ... → False.
13. if iterable(a): ... → a is a string, so skip.
14. if not isinstance(a, str): ... → a is a string, so skip.
15. Now, we reach the code that parses the string:
    - from sympy.parsing.sympy_parser import parse_expr, ...
    - transformations = standard_transformations
    - if rational: ... → rational is False, so skip.
    - if convert_xor: ... → True by default, so transformations += (t_convert_xor,)
    - a = a.replace('\n', '') → a = "{2.0, 3}"
    - expr = parse_expr(a, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)
16. What does parse_expr("{2.0, 3}", ...) do?
    - In SymPy, curly braces are not standard for sets, but parse_expr does support set notation: {2.0, 3} is parsed as a FiniteSet(2.0, 3).
    - So, expr = FiniteSet(2.0, 3)
17. The output structure is {"_args_set": XXX}. We need to fill in the value of expr.
    - The set will be FiniteSet(2.0, 3), but in JSON, sets are represented as lists or similar.
    - The order in FiniteSet is not guaranteed, but for {2.0, 3}, it will be [2.0, 3] or [3, 2.0]. Let's use [2.0, 3] for clarity.
