[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the check_winner function step by step.

- The board is 10x10.
- The function iterates over every cell. For each non-empty cell, it checks in 4 directions (right, down, diagonal down-right, diagonal down-left) for 5 in a row.

Let's look at the board:

Row 0: ["O", "O", "O", "O", "O", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]
Row 5: [" ", "X", "X", "X", "X", "X", " ", " ", " ", " "]

All other rows are empty.

First, the function will start at (0,0), which is "O".

- For (0,0), symbol is "O".
- Directions:
    - (0,1): right
        - (0,1): "O"
        - (0,2): "O"
        - (0,3): "O"
        - (0,4): "O"
        - That's 5 in a row: (0,0)-(0,4), all "O".
        - _check_five_in_a_row will return True.
- So, check_winner will return "O" immediately.

It will not check the X's in row 5, because the first winner found is "O".

Therefore, the output is "O".
