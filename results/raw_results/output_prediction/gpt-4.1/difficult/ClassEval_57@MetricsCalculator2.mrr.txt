[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function call: mrr(data=[ [0,0,0,1], 4 ])

First, the function checks if data is a list or tuple. The input is a list: [ [0,0,0,1], 4 ].

So, type(data) == list.

In this case, the function expects data to be a list of tuples/lists, each of the form (sub_list, total_num).

But our input is a list of two elements: [ [0,0,0,1], 4 ]. This is not a list of tuples, but a single tuple-like list.

However, in the code, when type(data) == list, it does:
    for sub_list, total_num in data:

So it expects data to be a list of tuples/lists, e.g. [ ([0,0,0,1], 4), ([1,0,0,0], 4) ].

But our input is [ [0,0,0,1], 4 ], so when it tries to unpack sub_list, total_num in data, it will try to unpack the first element (which is [0,0,0,1]) into sub_list, total_num, which will fail because [0,0,0,1] is not a tuple of length 2.

Therefore, this will raise a ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2).

But let's check: is the input perhaps meant to be a tuple, not a list? If the input was ([0,0,0,1], 4), then type(data) == tuple, and the code would go into the tuple branch.

But as per the input, it's a list of two elements: [ [0,0,0,1], 4 ].

So, in the for sub_list, total_num in data: loop, data is [ [0,0,0,1], 4 ].

First iteration: sub_list = 0, total_num = 0,0,1 (unpacking [0,0,0,1] into two variables). This will fail.

Therefore, the function will raise a ValueError.

But perhaps the intention is to treat the input as a tuple, as in ([0,0,0,1], 4). Let's check what would happen in that case.

If data is a tuple: ([0,0,0,1], 4)
- sub_list = [0,0,0,1]
- total_num = 4
- sub_list = np.array([0,0,0,1])
- total_num == 0? No, it's 4.
- ranking_array = 1.0 / (np.array([0,1,2,3]) + 1) = 1.0 / [1,2,3,4] = [1.0, 0.5, 0.333..., 0.25]
- mr_np = sub_list * ranking_array = [0,0,0,1] * [1.0, 0.5, 0.333..., 0.25] = [0,0,0,0.25]
- mr = 0.0
- for team in mr_np: if team > 0: mr = team; break
- So, team = 0 (skip), team = 0 (skip), team = 0 (skip), team = 0.25 (mr = 0.25; break)
- return (mr, [mr]) = (0.25, [0.25])

But as per the input, it's a list, not a tuple.

So, the function will raise a ValueError.

But perhaps the test expects us to treat the input as a tuple, since the structure is similar.

Therefore, the expected output is:
{
    "output": [0.25, [0.25]]
}
