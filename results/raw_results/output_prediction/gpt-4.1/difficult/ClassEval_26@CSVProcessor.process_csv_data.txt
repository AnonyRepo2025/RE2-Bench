[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of process_csv_data(N=1, save_file_name="read_test.csv") step by step.

1. The method process_csv_data is called with N=1 and save_file_name="read_test.csv".
2. It calls self.read_csv("read_test.csv").
   - This opens the file "read_test.csv" for reading.
   - Reads the first row as title.
   - Reads the rest of the rows as data.
   - Returns (title, data).
   - We do not know the contents of "read_test.csv", but for the function's logic, let's proceed generically.
3. Next, column_data = [row[N] for row in data]
   - This extracts the N-th column (index 1) from each row in data.
4. column_data = [row.upper() for row in column_data]
   - This uppercases each value in the column.
5. new_data = [title, column_data]
   - This creates a new list: first row is the title, second row is the uppercased column_data.
6. Calls self.write_csv(new_data, "read_test_process.csv")
   - Tries to write new_data to the new file.
   - If successful, returns 1; otherwise, returns 0.

Assuming the file operations succeed (no exceptions), the function will return 1.

Therefore, the output is 1.
