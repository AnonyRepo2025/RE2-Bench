[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `exptrigsimp` with the given input.

1. **Input**: 
   - expr = "(1 + \"exp(2)\")/(y*(-1 + \"exp(2)\"))"
   - This is a string, so the first step is to sympify it.

2. **Sympify**:
   - The string contains `"exp(2)"`, which should be interpreted as the exponential function, i.e., \( e^2 \).
   - So, the expression is: \(\frac{1 + e^{2}}{y(-1 + e^{2})}\)

3. **First bottom_up (exp_trig)**:
   - The function `exp_trig` is applied bottom-up to the expression.
   - `exp_trig` checks if the expression has any trigonometric or hyperbolic functions. In this case, it does not, only exponentials.
   - It also tries to rewrite the expression in terms of `exp` and `cos`, but since it's already in terms of `exp`, nothing changes.
   - So, after this step, the expression remains: \(\frac{1 + e^{2}}{y(-1 + e^{2})}\)

4. **Second bottom_up (f)**:
   - The function `f` is applied bottom-up.
   - It checks if the expression is a multiplication (`is_Mul`). The top-level is a division, so it's not a Mul.
   - So, nothing changes.

5. **Check for Hyperbolic or Trigonometric Functions**:
   - The expression does not have any hyperbolic or trigonometric functions, so nothing changes.

6. **Check for I (imaginary unit)**:
   - The expression does not have I, so nothing changes.

7. **Return**:
   - The expression is returned as is.

**Conclusion**: The output is the simplified form of the input, which is:
\[
\frac{1 + e^{2}}{y(-1 + e^{2})}
\]

In SymPy, this would be represented as:
\[
\frac{1 + \exp(2)}{y(-1 + \exp(2))}
\]
