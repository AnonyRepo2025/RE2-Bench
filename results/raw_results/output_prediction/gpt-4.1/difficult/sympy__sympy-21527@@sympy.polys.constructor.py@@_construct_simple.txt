[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `_construct_simple` with the given input.

Input:
- coeffs: null (which in Python will be None)
- opt: {}

Step 1: The function starts by initializing several flags and an empty list:
```python
rationals = floats = complexes = algebraics = False
float_numbers = []
```

Step 2: It checks if `opt.extension` is True. But `opt` is just an empty dict, so `opt.extension` will raise an AttributeError if accessed. However, the code as written expects `opt` to be an object with an `extension` attribute. Since it's a dict, `opt.extension` will fail.

But let's see what happens next. The code does:
```python
if opt.extension is True:
    is_algebraic = lambda coeff: coeff.is_number and coeff.is_algebraic
else:
    is_algebraic = lambda coeff: False
```
So, since `opt` is a dict, `opt.extension` will raise an AttributeError.

But let's assume for the sake of this simulation that the code is robust and instead tries to access `opt.get('extension')`, which would return None, so the else branch is taken:
```python
is_algebraic = lambda coeff: False
```

Step 3: The function then tries to iterate over `coeffs`:
```python
for coeff in coeffs:
    ...
```
But `coeffs` is None, so `for coeff in coeffs:` will raise a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable.

Therefore, the function will not proceed further and will raise a TypeError.

So the output should be an error, specifically a TypeError.

But the output structure expects a value for "output". If the function raises an exception, the output would be null or an error message.

Assuming the function is not wrapped in a try/except and the error is not caught, the function will not return anything, and the output is an error.

If we are to fill the output as per the structure, the output is null (since the function does not return anything).
