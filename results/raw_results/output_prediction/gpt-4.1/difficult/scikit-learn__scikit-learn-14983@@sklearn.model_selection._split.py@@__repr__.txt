[THOUGHT]
The `__repr__` method in `BaseCrossValidator` calls `_build_repr(self)`. However, the code for `_build_repr` is not provided in the snippet. In scikit-learn, `_build_repr` is a utility function that returns a string representation of the estimator, typically including the class name and its parameters.

Since `BaseCrossValidator` is an abstract class and does not have any parameters defined in its `__init__`, the default representation would be the class name with empty parentheses, i.e., "BaseCrossValidator()".

Given the input, the attributes `test_fold` and `unique_folds` are not standard parameters and would not be included in the repr unless the class is customized to do so, which is not shown here.

Therefore, the output will be:
```
{
    "output": "BaseCrossValidator()"
}
```
