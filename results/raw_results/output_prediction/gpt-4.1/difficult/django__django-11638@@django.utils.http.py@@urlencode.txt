[THOUGHT]
1. The function `urlencode` is called with `query` as a list of pairs: `[["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]`. The default for `doseq` is `False`.
2. The function checks if `query` is a `MultiValueDict` (it's not), or if it has an `items` attribute (it doesn't, since it's a list).
3. It then iterates over the list of pairs.
4. For each pair, it checks if the value is `None` (it's not), and since `doseq` is `False` and the value is an int, it sets `query_val = value`.
5. It appends each pair to `query_params` as is: `[("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)]`.
6. Finally, it calls `original_urlencode(query_params, doseq)`. The standard library's `urlencode` will convert the ints to strings and produce: `"a=1&b=2&c=3"`.
