[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code for the `to` method of `FunctionUnitBase` with the given input.

1. The method signature is:
   ```python
   def to(self, other, value=1.0, equivalencies=[]):
   ```
   The input provides:
   - self: a FunctionUnitBase instance with
     - _physical_unit: a unit (meter)
     - _function_unit: an object with _scale = -2.0
   - args:
     - other: a unit (meter)
     - value: "2.5" (as a string)
   - kwargs:
     - equivalencies: null (so will be None in Python)

2. The method starts:
   ```python
   if other is self.physical_unit:
       return self.to_physical(value)
   ```
   - self.physical_unit is not shown in the input, but from the class, it's likely a property that returns self._physical_unit.
   - other is a unit (meter), self._physical_unit is also meter, and they have the same _hash.
   - In Python, `is` checks for object identity, not equality. But in this context, let's assume that the two objects are the same instance (since their hashes and all fields match, and this is a common pattern in astropy).
   - So, `other is self.physical_unit` is True.

3. Therefore, the method returns:
   ```python
   return self.to_physical(value)
   ```
   - What does `to_physical` do? It's not defined in the code provided, but by convention, it converts the value from the function unit to the physical unit.
   - Since value is "2.5" (a string), but in practice, this would be converted to a float.
   - Since we don't have the implementation, but the logic is: if the function unit is a log or mag, it would do something; otherwise, for a scale, it would multiply by the scale.
   - Given _scale = -2.0, it's likely that to_physical(value) = value * _scale, or possibly value ** _scale, but more likely multiplication for a scale.

4. So, to_physical("2.5") = 2.5 * -2.0 = -5.0

5. Therefore, the output is -5.0.

6. The output structure is:
   ```
   {
       "output": XXX        
   }
   ```
   So, we fill in -5.0.
