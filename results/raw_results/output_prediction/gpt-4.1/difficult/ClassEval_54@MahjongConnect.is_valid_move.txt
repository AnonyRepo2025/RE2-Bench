[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code for is_valid_move((0,0), (0,1)) on the given board.

1. BOARD_SIZE is [4,4], so valid indices are 0-3 for both x and y.
2. pos1 = (0,0), pos2 = (0,1)
3. First check: Are both positions in bounds?
   - 0 <= 0 < 4 and 0 <= 0 < 4: True
   - 0 <= 0 < 4 and 0 <= 1 < 4: True
   - So, both positions are in bounds.
4. Second check: Are the positions the same?
   - (0,0) != (0,1): True, so continue.
5. Third check: Do the icons at both positions match?
   - board[0][0] = 'a'
   - board[0][1] = 'b'
   - 'a' != 'b', so this check fails.

At this point, is_valid_move returns False without checking for a path, because the icons do not match.
