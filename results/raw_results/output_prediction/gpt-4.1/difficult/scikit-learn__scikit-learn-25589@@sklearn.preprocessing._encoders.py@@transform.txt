[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the execution of `OneHotEncoder.transform` with the given input.

1. **Input summary**:
   - `self` is a OneHotEncoder instance, but most of its fitted attributes (`categories_`, `_drop_idx_after_grouping`, etc.) are `null` (i.e., None).
   - `handle_unknown` is set to `"infrequent_if_exist"`.
   - `X` is a 2D array with shape (2, 1): `[['55555'], ['22']]`.

2. **First step in `transform`**:
   - `check_is_fitted(self)` is called. This will check that the estimator is fitted by looking for attributes like `categories_`. But in the input, `categories_` is `null` (None), which means the encoder is NOT fitted.
   - In scikit-learn, if you call `transform` on an unfitted encoder, it will raise a `NotFittedError` (or, in some cases, an AttributeError or ValueError).

3. **What happens next?**
   - The code will not proceed to the rest of the transform logic, because `check_is_fitted` will raise an error due to missing `categories_`.

4. **What is the expected output?**
   - Since the function will raise an error, there will be no output in the expected structure. However, the question asks for the output in the given structure, which expects the sparse matrix representation.

5. **But, if we were to ignore the error and try to proceed:**
   - The encoder has not been fitted, so it does not know what categories to encode.
   - In real scikit-learn, this would not be possible; you must fit the encoder first.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The only possible output is an error, but since the structure expects a matrix, the only valid answer is that the function will raise an error due to the encoder not being fitted.

**But** if we must fill the structure, the only possible values are empty arrays, as no transformation can be performed.

But the correct answer is: the function will raise an error due to the encoder not being fitted.
