[THOUGHT]
The function `restify` is called with `cls=None`. Let's step through the function:

1. The first check is `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`. Since `cls` is `None`, this condition is True.
2. The function immediately returns the string `':py:obj:`None`'`.

So, the output will be `:py:obj:`None``.
