[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step.

1. The object is initialized with:
   - stack = ["["]
   - expr = "[(){}"
   - left_brackets = ["(", "{", "["]
   - right_brackets = [")", "}", "]"]

2. check_balanced_brackets() is called.

3. First, clear_expr() is called:
   - It filters expr to only keep characters in left_brackets or right_brackets.
   - expr = "[(){}" â†’ all characters are brackets, so expr remains "[(){}".

4. Now, iterate over each Brkt in expr:

   - Initial stack: ["["]

   - Brkt 1: "["
     - It's a left bracket, so append to stack.
     - stack: ["[", "["]

   - Brkt 2: "("
     - It's a left bracket, so append to stack.
     - stack: ["[", "[", "("]

   - Brkt 3: ")"
     - It's a right bracket.
     - Pop from stack: Current_Brkt = "("
     - Since Current_Brkt == "(", check if Brkt == ")": Yes, continue.
     - stack: ["[", "["]

   - Brkt 4: "{"
     - It's a left bracket, so append to stack.
     - stack: ["[", "[", "{"]

   - Brkt 5: "}"
     - It's a right bracket.
     - Pop from stack: Current_Brkt = "{"
     - Since Current_Brkt == "{", check if Brkt == "}": Yes, continue.
     - stack: ["[", "["]

5. After the loop, check if stack is empty.
   - stack: ["[", "["]
   - stack is not empty, so return False.

Therefore, the output is False.
