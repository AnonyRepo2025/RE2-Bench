[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and the input step by step.

1. The method being called is `Set._complement(self, other)`. The input is:
   - `self`: an instance of `Set` (details not specified, so it's a generic Set)
   - `other`: an object with attribute `_elements` = "frozenset({10, 15})", which suggests it's a `FiniteSet` containing 10 and 15.

2. The code for `_complement`:
   - The first check is `if isinstance(other, ProductSet): ...` → Not the case, since `other` is a `FiniteSet`.
   - Next: `elif isinstance(other, Interval): ...` → Not the case.
   - Next: `elif isinstance(other, Union): ...` → Not the case.
   - Next: `elif isinstance(other, Complement): ...` → Not the case.
   - Next: `elif isinstance(other, EmptySet): ...` → Not the case.
   - Next: `elif isinstance(other, FiniteSet): ...` → This is true.

3. For `FiniteSet`, the code is:
   ```
   from sympy.utilities.iterables import sift

   def ternary_sift(el):
       contains = self.contains(el)
       return contains if contains in [True, False] else None
   sifted = sift(other, ternary_sift)
   return Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet)
   ```
   - So, for each element in `other` (i.e., 10 and 15), we check if `self.contains(el)` is True, False, or None.
   - The result is a dict: sifted[True], sifted[False], sifted[None].

4. Since `self` is a generic `Set` (not specified), and `other` is a `FiniteSet({10, 15})`, what does `self.contains(10)` and `self.contains(15)` return?
   - In the base `Set` class, `contains` is defined as:
     ```
     def contains(self, other):
         other = sympify(other, strict=True)
         ret = sympify(self._contains(other))
         if ret is None:
             ret = Contains(other, self, evaluate=False)
         return ret
     ```
   - But the base `Set` class does not implement `_contains`, so it will likely return `None`, and thus `Contains(other, self, evaluate=False)`.

   - In the context of `sift`, the ternary_sift will return None for both elements, because `contains` returns a symbolic `Contains` object, not True or False.

5. So, `sifted[None]` will be [10, 15], and `sifted[False]` will be empty.

6. The return value is:
   ```
   Union(
       FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), 
       Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet
   )
   ```
   - Since `sifted[False]` is empty, `FiniteSet()` is the empty set.
   - Since `sifted[None]` is [10, 15], `Complement(FiniteSet(10, 15), self, evaluate=False)`.

   - So the result is: `Union(EmptySet, Complement(FiniteSet(10, 15), self, evaluate=False))`
   - But `Union(EmptySet, X)` is just `X`.

7. Therefore, the result is `Complement(FiniteSet(10, 15), self, evaluate=False)`.

8. The output structure expects an `_elements` field. For a `FiniteSet`, this would be the elements. But the result is a `Complement` object, not a `FiniteSet`.

9. However, in the code, the output structure is always a dict with an `_elements` key, so we should represent the elements of the result.

10. Since the result is `Complement(FiniteSet(10, 15), self, evaluate=False)`, the elements are still `{10, 15}` (as the set being complemented), but the actual set is "all elements in {10, 15} that are not in self", but since we don't know what `self` is, the complement is symbolic.

11. Given the structure, the best we can do is to represent the elements as "frozenset({10, 15})".
