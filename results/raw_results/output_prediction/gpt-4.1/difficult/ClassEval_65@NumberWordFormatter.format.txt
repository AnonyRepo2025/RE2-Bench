[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code for the input.

- The input is: x = null (which is Python's None).
- The function called is format(self, x).
- The first line in format is:
    if x is not None:
        return self.format_string(str(x))
    else:
        return ''
- Since x is None, x is not not None is False, so we go to the else branch.
- The function will return '' (empty string).

Therefore, the output is an empty string.
