[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `restify` with the given input.

Input:
- cls = {"__module__": "tests.test_util_typing"}

1. The function first checks if `cls is None or cls is NoneType`. Our input is a dict, not None, so this is False.
2. Next, it checks if `cls is Ellipsis`. Again, False.
3. Then, it checks if `cls in INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES`. Our input is a dict, not a type, so this is False.
4. Then, it checks `inspect.isNewType(cls)`. The function `isNewType` tries to get `__module__` and `__qualname__` from `cls` using `safe_getattr`. Our input dict has `__module__` but not `__qualname__`, so `safe_getattr(cls, '__qualname__', None)` returns None. The check `__module__ == 'typing' and __qualname__ == 'NewType.<locals>.new_type'` is False.
5. Next, it checks if `types_Union and isinstance(cls, types_Union)`. Our input is a dict, not a type, so False.
6. Then, it checks `cls.__module__ in ('__builtin__', 'builtins')`. Our input is a dict, so accessing `cls.__module__` will raise an AttributeError. In Python, accessing an attribute on a dict that doesn't exist raises AttributeError. So, this will raise an exception.
7. The function does not catch this exception, so it will propagate.

But, in the code, the next step is:
- If sys.version_info >= (3, 7): return _restify_py37(cls)
- else: return _restify_py36(cls)

But before that, it tries to access `cls.__module__`, which will fail for a dict.

Therefore, the function will raise an AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute '__module__'.

But the output structure expects a value for "output". Since the function will error, but the structure expects a string, the most likely output is that the function will raise an exception and not return a value.

But if we were to simulate what would happen if the function continued, it would error at `cls.__module__`.

So, the output is an AttributeError.

But since the output structure expects a string, and the function would not return a value, the best answer is to indicate the error.

But if the function did not error, and just returned the string representation of the class, it would go to the last else clause and call `_restify_py37(cls)` or `_restify_py36(cls)`. But since the input is a dict, not a type, this is not possible.

Therefore, the output is an error: AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute '__module__'
