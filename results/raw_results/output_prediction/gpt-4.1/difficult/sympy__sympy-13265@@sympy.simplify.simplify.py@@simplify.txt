[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the function step by step with the input expr="50":

1. The function starts by calling `sympify(expr)`. Since expr is the string "50", `sympify("50")` will convert it to the SymPy Integer 50.
2. The function then tries to call `expr._eval_simplify(...)`, but Integer does not have this method, so it passes.
3. It sets `original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)`. For an integer, `signsimp(50)` just returns 50.
4. It checks if expr is a Basic and has args. Integer(50) is a Basic, but its args are empty, so the function returns expr immediately.

Therefore, the output is just the integer 50.
