[THOUGHT]
1. The function `replace_named_groups` takes a regex pattern string and replaces any named group (e.g., `(?P<name>...)`) with just the group name (e.g., `name`).
2. It uses `named_group_matcher = re.compile('\\(\\?P(<\\w+>)')` to find named groups. This regex looks for the literal string `(?P<` followed by one or more word characters and a closing `>`.
3. The input pattern is `"admin/password_change/done/"`.
4. Let's check if there are any named groups in this pattern. There are no substrings like `(?P<name>...)` in the input.
5. Therefore, `named_group_matcher.finditer(pattern)` will yield nothing, so `named_group_indices` will be an empty list.
6. The rest of the function will not modify the pattern, and it will return the original pattern.
