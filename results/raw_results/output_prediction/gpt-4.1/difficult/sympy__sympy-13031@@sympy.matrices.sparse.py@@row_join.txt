[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code for `row_join` with the given input.

1. Input:
   - self: a MutableSparseMatrix with _smat = {}, rows = 2, cols = 0
   - other: a matrix with rows = 2, cols = 1, _mat = null

2. The first line of `row_join`:
   ```
   if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:
       return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)
   ```
   - self.cols == 0 (True)
   - self.rows == 2, other.rows == 2 (so self.rows != other.rows is False)
   - So this block is skipped.

3. Next:
   ```
   A, B = (self, other)
   if not A.rows == B.rows:
       raise ShapeError()
   ```
   - A.rows == B.rows == 2, so no error.

4. Next:
   ```
   A = A.copy()
   ```
   - This calls SparseMatrix.copy, which calls _new(self.rows, self.cols, self._smat)
   - self.rows = 2, self.cols = 0, self._smat = {}
   - So A is a new MutableSparseMatrix with rows=2, cols=0, _smat={}

5. Next:
   ```
   if not isinstance(B, SparseMatrix):
       k = 0
       b = B._mat
       for i in range(B.rows):
           for j in range(B.cols):
               v = b[k]
               if v:
                   A._smat[i, j + A.cols] = v
               k += 1
   else:
       for (i, j), v in B._smat.items():
           A._smat[i, j + A.cols] = v
   ```
   - Is B a SparseMatrix? The input doesn't specify, but since _mat is present and _smat is not, and the code is written to handle both, let's assume B is not a SparseMatrix (since _mat is present and _smat is not).
   - So we take the first branch.

6. In the first branch:
   - k = 0
   - b = B._mat
   - But B._mat is null (None). This is a bit odd, but let's see what happens.
   - for i in range(B.rows): (i = 0, 1)
     for j in range(B.cols): (j = 0)
       v = b[k]  # b is None, so b[k] will raise an error.
   - But in the context of SymPy, if you create a 2x1 matrix with no data, it is filled with zeros.
   - So, in practice, b would be [0, 0] (the default for a 2x1 matrix).
   - So v = 0 for both entries.

   - For i=0, j=0: v = 0, so if v: is False, nothing is added to A._smat.
   - For i=1, j=0: v = 0, so again, nothing is added.

7. After the loop, A.cols += B.cols
   - A.cols = 0, B.cols = 1, so A.cols = 1

8. Return A

So the result is a MutableSparseMatrix with:
- _smat = {} (no nonzero entries)
- rows = 2
- cols = 1

But the output structure expects:
```
{
    "_smat": {
        "(0, 0)": XXX,
        "(1, 0)": XXX
    },
    "rows": XXX,
    "cols": XXX
}
```
But since _smat is empty, there are no nonzero entries, so these keys are not present. But the structure expects them, so we should fill them with 0.

rows = 2
cols = 1

So the output is:
- _smat: (0,0): 0, (1,0): 0
- rows: 2
- cols: 1
