[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `doit(p, q)` as defined inside `Mod.eval`.

Input:
- p = "zoo"
- q = "0"

In SymPy, "zoo" is the symbol for the complex infinity, and "0" is the integer zero.

Step-by-step through `doit(p, q)`:

1. The first condition:
   ```
   if p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or (q is nan):
       return nan
   ```
   - p = zoo, so p.is_infinite is True (zoo is infinite).
   - Therefore, this condition is satisfied, and the function returns nan.

So, the output is nan.
