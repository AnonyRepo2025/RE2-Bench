Let's step through the logic of MatrixExpr._eval_Eq:

1. The method signature is: def _eval_Eq(self, other)
2. The first check: if not isinstance(other, MatrixExpr): return False
   - Both self and other are empty dicts in the input, but in practice, this method is only called on MatrixExpr instances. Since the input is just {}, we must assume that both are MatrixExpr instances (since otherwise the method would not be called).
3. Next: if self.shape != other.shape: return False
   - The shape property is defined as self.shape[0], self.shape[1], and is expected to be a tuple (rows, cols).
   - If self.shape != other.shape, return False.
   - Since both self and other are empty dicts, but in practice, this method is only called on MatrixExpr instances, and the default MatrixExpr does not define shape directly, but expects subclasses to do so.
   - If shape is not defined, this would raise an AttributeError, but let's assume both have the same shape for this test.
4. Next: if (self - other).is_ZeroMatrix: return True
   - self - other calls __sub__, which returns MatAdd(self, -other, check=True).doit()
   - If the result is a ZeroMatrix, return True.
   - Otherwise, return Eq(self, other, evaluate=False)

So, if self and other are the same object (or represent the same symbolic matrix), and their difference is ZeroMatrix, return True. Otherwise, return Eq(self, other, evaluate=False).

Given the input is just empty dicts, but the function expects MatrixExpr instances, and no further information is given, the only safe default is that the shapes are the same, but (self - other).is_ZeroMatrix is not True (since we have no evidence for that).

Therefore, the output will be Eq(self, other, evaluate=False).

In SymPy, this would be represented as Eq(self, other, evaluate=False), but in JSON, this would be a symbolic representation.

So, the output is:
{
    "output": "Eq(self, other, evaluate=False)"
}
