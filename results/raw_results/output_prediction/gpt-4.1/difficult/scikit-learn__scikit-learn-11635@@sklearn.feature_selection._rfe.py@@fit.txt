[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the execution of RFECV.fit step by step with the provided input.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `X` is a 2D array (150, 4) with the first row containing `[nan, inf, 1.4, 0.2]`.
   - `y` is a 1D array of length 150, with values 0, 1, 2 (iris-like).

2. **Step 1: check_X_y**
   - The first operation is `X, y = check_X_y(X, y, 'csr', ensure_min_features=2, force_all_finite=False)`.
   - `force_all_finite=False` means it will not raise on NaN or inf, but will still convert to numpy arrays.
   - `ensure_min_features=2` is satisfied (X has 4 features).
   - So, X and y are accepted as numpy arrays, even with nan/inf.

3. **Step 2: check_cv**
   - `cv = check_cv(self.cv, y, is_classifier(self.estimator))`
   - `self.cv` is 5, `is_classifier(self.estimator)` checks for `_estimator_type == 'classifier'`, but the estimator is just a dict with `foo_param: 0`, so this will be False.
   - So, `check_cv(5, y, False)` returns `KFold(5)`.

4. **Step 3: check_scoring**
   - `scorer = check_scoring(self.estimator, scoring=self.scoring)`
   - `self.scoring` is None.
   - `check_scoring` checks if estimator has a `score` method. Our estimator is a dict, so it does not.
   - This will raise: `TypeError("estimator should be an estimator implementing 'fit' method, %r was passed" % estimator)`
   - So, the code will not proceed past this point.

**Conclusion:** The code will raise a TypeError at check_scoring because the estimator is a dict and does not have a `fit` method.

**Expected output:** There will be no output for the structure, as an exception is raised. But since the task is to fill the structure, and the code cannot proceed, all values after this point are undefined.

But if we are to fill the structure as per the code's logic up to the error, the only values we can fill are those from the input, and the rest would be null or not set.

But the correct answer is: **TypeError is raised**.

But since the structure expects values, let's fill in what we can:

- estimator: {"foo_param": 0}
- step: 1
- cv: 5
- scoring: null
- verbose: 0
- n_jobs: null
- min_features_to_select: 1
- support_: null
- n_features_: null
- ranking_: null
- estimator_: {"foo_param": 0, "coef_": null}
- grid_scores_: null

But again, the real output is an exception.
