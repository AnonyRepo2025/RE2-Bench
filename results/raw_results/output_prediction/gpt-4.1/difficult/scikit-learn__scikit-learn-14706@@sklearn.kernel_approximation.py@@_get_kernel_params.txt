Let's step through the `_get_kernel_params` method for the given input.

1. `params = self.kernel_params` → `self.kernel_params` is `null` (None in Python), so `params = None`.
2. `if params is None: params = {}` → So now `params` is an empty dict.
3. `if not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed':`
   - `self.kernel` is `"polynomial"`, which is a string, so not callable, and not "precomputed". So this branch is taken.
4. `for param in KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]:`
   - We need to know what `KERNEL_PARAMS` is for "polynomial". In scikit-learn, for "polynomial" kernel, the relevant params are: `['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree']`.
5. For each param in `['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree']`, if `getattr(self, param) is not None`, add to params.
   - `self.gamma` is `null` (None) → skip.
   - `self.coef0` is `0.1` (not None) → add `'coef0': 0.1` to params.
   - `self.degree` is `3.1` (not None) → add `'degree': 3.1` to params.

So the output should be:
```
{
    "coef0": 0.1,
    "degree": 3.1
}
```
