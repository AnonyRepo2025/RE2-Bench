[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `stringify` with the given input.

Input:
annotation = {
    "__module__": "tests.test_util_typing",
    "__doc__": null
}

1. The function first checks if `annotation` is a string. It is not; it's a dict.
2. Next, it checks if `annotation` is a TypeVar. It is not.
3. Then, it checks if `inspect.isNewType(annotation)` is True. Let's see what happens:
   - `isNewType` tries to get `__module__` and `__qualname__` from the object.
   - `safe_getattr(annotation, '__module__', None)` returns "tests.test_util_typing" (from the dict).
   - `safe_getattr(annotation, '__qualname__', None)` returns None (not present in the dict).
   - So, `isNewType` returns False.
4. Next, it checks `elif not annotation:`. The dict is truthy, so this is False.
5. Then, `elif annotation is NoneType:`. It is not.
6. Then, `elif annotation in INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES:`. The dict is not a key in that dict.
7. Next, it checks if `getattr(annotation, '__module__', None) == 'builtins' and hasattr(annotation, '__qualname__')`.
   - `getattr(annotation, '__module__', None)` will fail, because annotation is a dict, not an object with attributes. This will raise an AttributeError.
   - But the code does not catch this, so it will raise an exception.
   - However, in the function, the next check is `elif annotation is Ellipsis:`, which is not the case.
8. Now, it checks the Python version and calls `_stringify_py37` or `_stringify_py36`.
   - Let's assume Python 3.7+ (since the code is modern).
   - `_stringify_py37(annotation)` is called.

But `_stringify_py37` is not defined in the code provided, so we have to assume what it does. However, in the absence of a match in all the above, the function would eventually call `repr(annotation)`.

But before that, let's check the line:
   elif not annotation:
        return repr(annotation)

But our annotation is a dict with keys, so it's truthy.

So, the function will eventually call `_stringify_py37(annotation)`. Since we don't have its implementation, but the fallback is usually `repr(annotation)`.

Therefore, the output will be the string representation of the dict:
"{'__module__': 'tests.test_util_typing', '__doc__': None}"
