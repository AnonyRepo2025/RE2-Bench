[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code and the input:

1. The method being called is `world_to_pixel_values` on a `SlicedLowLevelWCS` instance.
2. The input provides:
   - `self._wcs` is a WCS-like object with `naxis=3`.
   - `self._pixel_keep = [0 1]` (as a numpy array, shape (2,))
   - `self._world_keep = [0 1]` (as a numpy array, shape (2,))
   - `self._slices_pixel = None`
   - No world arguments are provided (`args` is empty).

3. The method signature is `def world_to_pixel_values(self, *world_arrays):`
   - Since no world_arrays are provided, `world_arrays` is an empty tuple.

4. The first line in the method:
   ```
   sliced_out_world_coords = self._pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep))
   ```
   - `len(self._pixel_keep)` is 2, so this is `self._pixel_to_world_values_all(0, 0)`

5. Let's look at `_pixel_to_world_values_all`:
   - It takes `*pixel_arrays`, so here `pixel_arrays = (0, 0)`
   - It maps `np.asanyarray` over pixel_arrays, so `pixel_arrays = (array(0), array(0))`
   - It initializes `pixel_arrays_new = []` and `ipix_curr = -1`
   - It loops over `range(self._wcs.pixel_n_dim)`, which is `range(3)` (since naxis=3)
   - It tries to access `self._slices_pixel[ipix]` for each ipix in 0,1,2, but `self._slices_pixel` is None.

   This will raise a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable.

6. Therefore, the code will error out at this point, because it tries to subscript `self._slices_pixel` which is None.

7. The output should reflect that an error occurs, specifically a TypeError.
