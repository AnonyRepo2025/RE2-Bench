Let's step through the function `_sparse_encode` with the given input.

**Step 1: Input Parsing**
- X: 3x8 numpy array (3 samples, 8 features)
- dictionary: 8x8 numpy array (8 components, 8 features)
- gram: 8x8 numpy array (precomputed Gram matrix)
- cov: None
- algorithm: "lasso_cd"
- regularization: 1.0
- copy_cov: True
- init: None
- max_iter: 1000
- check_input: False
- verbose: False
- positive: True

**Step 2: Initial Checks**
- X.ndim == 2, so no reshaping needed.
- n_samples = 3, n_features = 8
- n_components = 8 (dictionary.shape[0])
- dictionary.shape[1] == X.shape[1] == 8, so no error.

**Step 3: Covariance Calculation**
- cov is None and algorithm == "lasso_cd", so cov is not computed here (cov remains None).

**Step 4: Positive Coding Check**
- _check_positive_coding("lasso_cd", True) passes (no error).

**Step 5: Algorithm Branch**
- algorithm == "lasso_cd"
- alpha = float(regularization) / n_features = 1.0 / 8 = 0.125

**Step 6: Lasso (Coordinate Descent) Setup**
- clf = Lasso(alpha=0.125, fit_intercept=False, normalize=False, precompute=gram, max_iter=1000, warm_start=True, positive=True)
- init is None, so no coef_ initialization.

**Step 7: Fit Lasso**
- clf.fit(dictionary.T, X.T, check_input=False)
  - dictionary.T: shape (8, 8)
  - X.T: shape (8, 3)
- Lasso expects X: (n_samples, n_features), y: (n_samples, n_targets)
  - Here, X: (8, 8), y: (8, 3)
- Lasso will fit 3 targets (multi-target regression), each target is a column of X.T.

**Step 8: Output**
- new_code = clf.coef_
- For multi-target, Lasso.coef_ shape is (n_targets, n_features) = (3, 8)
- If new_code.ndim != 2: (it is 2), so return as is.

**Step 9: Return**
- Return new_code (shape 3x8), which is the sparse code for each sample.

**Step 10: What are the values?**
- Since the input is random and the Lasso is deterministic, but we don't have the actual Lasso implementation here, we can only describe the output:
  - Each row corresponds to the sparse code for one sample (of 3).
  - Each code is 8-dimensional, non-negative (positive=True), and sparse (many zeros).
  - The values are determined by Lasso regression with alpha=0.125, positive constraint, and the given dictionary and gram.

**Conclusion:**
- The output is a 3x8 numpy array, with non-negative values, representing the sparse codes for the 3 input samples.

**Since the actual values require running Lasso, and the input is random, let's show the structure and describe the output as a 3x8 array of non-negative floats.**
