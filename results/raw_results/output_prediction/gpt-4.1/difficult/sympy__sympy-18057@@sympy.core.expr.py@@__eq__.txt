[THOUGHT]
We are to predict the output of the `Expr.__eq__` method when called with `self` as an `Expr` instance (details not given, but not relevant for this case) and `other` as the string `"picoweber"`.

Let's step through the code:

1. The method starts with:
   ```python
   try:
       other = _sympify(other)
       if not isinstance(other, Expr):
           return False
   except (SympifyError, SyntaxError):
       return False
   ```
   - It tries to sympify `"picoweber"` using `_sympify`, which calls `sympify("picoweber", strict=True)`.
   - In `sympify`, since `"picoweber"` is a string, it will eventually try to parse it as a SymPy expression.
   - If `"picoweber"` is not a valid SymPy symbol or expression, `parse_expr` will raise a `SympifyError`.
   - Therefore, the `except` block will be triggered, and the method will return `False`.

2. So, the output is `False`.
