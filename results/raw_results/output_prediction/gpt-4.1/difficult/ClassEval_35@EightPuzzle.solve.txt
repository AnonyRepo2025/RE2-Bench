[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and the input step by step.

1. The EightPuzzle class is initialized with initial_state and goal_state, both set to:
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 0]
]
This is the solved state of the 8-puzzle.

2. The solve() method is called.
- open_list starts as [([initial_state], [])]
- closed_list is []

3. The while loop begins:
- open_list is not empty.
- current_state, path = open_list.pop(0)
  - current_state = initial_state (which is the goal state)
  - path = []

- closed_list.append(current_state)

- if current_state == self.goal_state:
    return path

Since the initial state is already the goal state, the function will immediately return path, which is [] (an empty list), meaning no moves are needed.

Therefore, the output is an empty list.
