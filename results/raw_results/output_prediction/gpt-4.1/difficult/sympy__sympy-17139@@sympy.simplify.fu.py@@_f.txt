[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `_TR56(rv, f, g, h, max, pow)`, which returns a function `_f(rv)`. The question is: what is the output of `_f` when called with `rv = -I*sin(x)`?

First, let's clarify the context:
- `rv` is a sympy expression, here the string "-I*sin(x)".
- The function `_f(rv)` checks if `rv` is a power (`is_Pow`) and if its base's function is `f`. If not, it returns `rv` unchanged.

Let's step through `_f(rv)`:

1. `if not (rv.is_Pow and rv.base.func == f): return rv`
   - `rv = -I*sin(x)`
   - Is `rv` a power? No, it's a product of `-I` and `sin(x)`.
   - So, `rv.is_Pow` is False.
   - Therefore, the condition is True, and `_f(rv)` returns `rv` unchanged.

Therefore, the output is just the input expression, unchanged.

If the input is a string, we should sympify it to a sympy expression. So, the output is `-I*sin(x)` as a sympy expression.
