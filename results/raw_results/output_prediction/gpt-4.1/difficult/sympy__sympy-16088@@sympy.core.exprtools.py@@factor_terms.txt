[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the execution of `factor_terms(expr="R3 + R4 + 4050")`:

1. The function first calls `sympify(expr)`. The input is the string `"R3 + R4 + 4050"`.
2. `sympify` parses this string into a SymPy expression: `R3 + R4 + 4050`, where `R3` and `R4` are treated as symbols, and `4050` as an integer.
3. The main function `do(expr)` is then called with this expression.

4. Inside `do`:
   - The expression is an `Add` (sum of terms).
   - It calls `expr.as_content_primitive(radical=radical, clear=clear)`. For an `Add`, this returns `(1, R3 + R4 + 4050)` because there is no common factor among the terms.
   - `p` is `R3 + R4 + 4050`, which is an `Add`.
   - It then processes each argument of the `Add`:
     - `do(R3)` returns `R3` (it's a symbol/atom).
     - `do(R4)` returns `R4`.
     - `do(4050)` returns `4050`.
   - It checks if all terms have a negative coefficient (they do not), so no sign change.
   - It checks for "special" exponents (not relevant here).
   - It calls `gcd_terms(p, ...)` to factor out any common factors. But since the terms are `R3`, `R4`, and `4050`, there is no common factor, so the expression remains unchanged.
   - The result is then `_keep_coeff(cont, p, ...)`, which is just `R3 + R4 + 4050`.

5. The function returns the unchanged expression.

So, the output is the same as the input, but as a SymPy expression: `R3 + R4 + 4050`.
