[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `periodicity(f, symbol, check=False)` for the input:

- f = "csc(2*x) - sec(x)"
- symbol = (not specified, but likely x)

Assume symbol is x.

1. The function first simplifies f:
   - f = simplify("csc(2*x) - sec(x)")
   - This will remain as csc(2*x) - sec(x), as no further simplification is possible.

2. Check if symbol in f.free_symbols:
   - Yes, x is present.

3. f is not a Relational.

4. f is not a TrigonometricFunction (it's an Add of two TrigonometricFunctions).

5. f is not Abs.

6. f.is_Pow: False

7. f.is_Mul: False

8. f.is_Add: True
   - k, g = f.as_independent(x)
   - For csc(2*x) - sec(x), k = 0, g = csc(2*x) - sec(x)
   - period = _periodicity(g.args, x)

   Let's look at _periodicity(g.args, x):
   - g.args = (csc(2*x), -sec(x))

   For each term:
   - periodicity(csc(2*x), x):
     - csc is a TrigonometricFunction.
     - csc(2*x).period(x) = pi
     - But since the argument is 2*x, the period is pi/2.
   - periodicity(-sec(x), x):
     - -sec(x) is a Mul, but the main function is sec(x), which is a TrigonometricFunction.
     - sec(x).period(x) = 2*pi

   So, the periods are:
   - csc(2*x): pi
   - But for csc(2*x), the period is pi, but since the argument is 2*x, the period is pi/2.
   - sec(x): 2*pi

   The overall period is the least common multiple (lcm) of the periods of the terms.

   So, lcm(pi/2, 2*pi):

   - pi/2 = 1*pi/2
   - 2*pi = 4*pi/2

   The lcm of 1 and 4 is 4, so lcm(pi/2, 2*pi) = 4*pi/2 = 2*pi

   But let's check: csc(2*x) has period pi, but because of the 2*x, the period is pi/2.
   - csc(2*x + pi) = csc(2*x + pi) = csc(2*(x + pi/2)) = csc(2*x + pi) = -csc(2*x)
   - So, the period is pi, but the function repeats every pi, but the minimal period is pi.

   Wait, let's check the period of csc(2*x):
   - csc(y) has period 2*pi, so csc(2*x) has period pi.

   So, csc(2*x) has period pi.
   - sec(x) has period 2*pi.

   So, the periods are pi and 2*pi.

   The lcm of pi and 2*pi is 2*pi.

   Therefore, the period of csc(2*x) - sec(x) is 2*pi.

   So, the output is 2*pi.
