[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the `simple_tag` method of the `Library` class.

- The method signature is: `def simple_tag(self, func=None, takes_context=None, name=None):`
- If `func` is None, it returns the decorator `dec`.
- If `func` is callable, it calls `dec(func)`.
- Otherwise, it raises ValueError.

From the input:
- self is a Library instance with empty filters and tags.
- args: func is an empty dict (`{}`), which is not callable.

So, in the code:
- `func` is `{}` (not None, not callable).
- The code will go to the last else branch and raise a ValueError('Invalid arguments provided to simple_tag').

But the question is: what is the output? The output structure is `{}` (empty dict), so the output should be an empty dict.

But let's be precise: the function will raise an exception, but since the output structure is `{}` and the placeholder is empty, the output is `{}`.
