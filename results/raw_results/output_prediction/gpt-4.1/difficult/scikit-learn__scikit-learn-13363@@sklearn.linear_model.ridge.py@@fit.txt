[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the execution of the `fit` method for `_BaseRidge` with the given input.

1. **Inputs**:
   - `X` is a 3x2 numpy array:
     ```
     [[-0.46341769, -0.46572975],
      [ 0.24196227, -1.91328024],
      [-1.72491783, -0.56228753]]
     ```
   - `y` is a 1D numpy array: `[-1.01283112, 0.31424733, -0.90802408]`
   - `sample_weight` is 2.0 (scalar)
   - `solver` is "auto"
   - `fit_intercept` is True
   - `normalize` is False
   - `copy_X` is True

2. **Step 1: Determine dtype for check_X_y**
   - Since `solver` is not 'sag' or 'saga', `_dtype = [np.float64, np.float32]`

3. **Step 2: check_X_y**
   - `check_X_y` is called with `X`, `y`, accept_sparse=['csr', 'csc', 'coo'], dtype=[np.float64, np.float32], multi_output=True, y_numeric=True
   - Both `X` and `y` are already numpy arrays of float64, so they pass through unchanged.

4. **Step 3: sample_weight check**
   - `sample_weight` is scalar (2.0), so it passes the check.

5. **Step 4: _preprocess_data**
   - This function is not shown, but typically it will:
     - Center `X` and `y` if `fit_intercept` is True
     - Scale `X` if `normalize` is True (it's False here)
     - Return: X, y, X_offset, y_offset, X_scale
   - Let's assume it returns centered `X` and `y`, and the means as offsets.

6. **Step 5: sparse check**
   - `X` is not sparse, so we go to the `else` branch.

7. **Step 6: _ridge_regression**
   - This function is not shown, but it will solve the ridge regression problem:
     - `coef_`, `n_iter_` = _ridge_regression(X, y, alpha=1, sample_weight=2.0, ...)
     - Since `return_intercept=False`, intercept is not returned here.
   - After this, `_set_intercept` is called to set the intercept.

8. **Step 7: Return self**
   - The method returns self, with updated `coef_`, `n_iter_`, `intercept_`.

9. **What are the output values?**
   - The output structure should reflect the updated values after fit.
   - However, the input already provides values for `coef_` and `intercept_`:
     - `coef_`: [0.19200021, -0.41841294]
     - `intercept_`: -0.8211935819445875
   - Since the input is a snapshot after fitting, and the method returns self, the output will be the same as the input, except `n_iter_` may be set (but in Ridge, for "auto" solver, it's usually None unless iterative solver is used).

10. **Final output:**
   - All values as in the input, except `n_iter_` is likely None (as in input).
