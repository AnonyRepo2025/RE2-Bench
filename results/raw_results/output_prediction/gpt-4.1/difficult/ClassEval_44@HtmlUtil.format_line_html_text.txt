[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function with the given input.

1. The input html_text is "<ul><li>Item 1</li></ul>".

2. The function checks if html_text is None or empty. It's not, so it proceeds.

3. It parses the HTML with BeautifulSoup using the lxml parser. The soup object now represents the HTML structure.

4. It finds all <pre> and <blockquote> tags to replace their content with CODE_MARK. There are none in this HTML, so nothing happens here.

5. It finds all <ul> and <ol> tags. There is one <ul>.

6. For each <ul> or <ol>, it finds all <li> tags. There is one <li> with text "Item 1".

7. For each <li>:
   - li_item_text = "Item 1"
   - It checks if li_item_text is empty. It's not.
   - It checks if the last character is in string.punctuation. "Item 1" ends with "1", which is not punctuation.
   - So, it sets li_item.string = '[{0}]{1}.'.format('-', li_item_text) → '[-]Item 1.' (the dot is added at the end).

8. Next, it finds all <p> tags. There are none, so nothing happens here.

9. It gets the text from the soup: soup.get_text() → '[-]Item 1.' (since the <li> was replaced).

10. It decodes HTML entities (none present), so the text remains '[-]Item 1.'.

11. It calls __format_line_feed, which replaces multiple newlines with a single newline. There are no newlines, so the text remains '[-]Item 1.'.

12. The function returns '[-]Item 1.'.

So the output is '[-]Item 1.'.
