Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

The function f takes two arguments: text and froms.

1. It first does `text.lstrip(froms)`. This removes all characters from the beginning of `text` that are present in the string `froms`, until it finds a character not in `froms`.
2. Then it does `text.rstrip(froms)`. This removes all characters from the end of `text` that are present in `froms`, until it finds a character not in `froms`.

Input:
- text: "0 t 1cos "
- froms: "st 0\t\n  " (which is: s, t, space, 0, tab, newline)

Let's process step by step:

First, lstrip:
- The beginning of text is "0". Is "0" in froms? Yes. Remove it.
- Next is " ". Is " " in froms? Yes. Remove it.
- Next is "t". Is "t" in froms? Yes. Remove it.
- Next is " ". Is " " in froms? Yes. Remove it.
- Next is "1". Is "1" in froms? No. Stop stripping.

So after lstrip, text is: "1cos "

Now, rstrip:
- The end of text is " ". Is " " in froms? Yes. Remove it.
- Now the end is "s". Is "s" in froms? Yes. Remove it.
- Now the end is "o". Is "o" in froms? No. Stop stripping.

So after rstrip, text is: "1co"

Therefore, the output is "1co".
