[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

1. The function `truncate_number` takes a float `number` and returns `number % 1.0`.
2. The modulo operation `%` with 1.0 returns the fractional part of the number.
3. For the input `number = 3.5`, the calculation is `3.5 % 1.0`.
4. 3.5 divided by 1.0 is 3 with a remainder of 0.5, so `3.5 % 1.0` is 0.5.
5. Therefore, the function will return 0.5.
