[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the code step by step.

1. The HRManagementSystem instance has self.employees = {"1": {...}}. Note that the key is the string "1".
2. The method remove_employee is called with employee_id = 2 (an integer).
3. The method checks if employee_id (2) is in self.employees. The keys in self.employees are strings, so 2 (int) is not equal to "1" (str).
4. Therefore, the if condition is False, and the method returns False.
