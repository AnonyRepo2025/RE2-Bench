[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step with the given input.

Inputs:
- array = [2, 15, 15, 1]
- list = [15, 1]

Step 1: array.extend(list)
- This will modify array in-place, appending all elements of list to array.
- array becomes: [2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1]

Step 2: [e for e in array if e % 2 == 0]
- This is a list comprehension, but its result is not assigned or used. It does nothing to array.

Step 3: return [e for e in array if e >= 10]
- This returns a new list containing all elements of array that are greater than or equal to 10.
- Let's check each element in array:
    - 2: not >= 10
    - 15: >= 10 (include)
    - 15: >= 10 (include)
    - 1: not >= 10
    - 15: >= 10 (include)
    - 1: not >= 10

So the output list is [15, 15, 15].
