[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the code step by step.

1. The class is initialized with data = "[1 2 3 4]". However, in the actual code, the constructor expects a list or array-like, but here the input is a string. Let's assume that in the test environment, this string is parsed into a numpy array as np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]).

2. The get_variance method calls np.var(self.data), which computes the variance of the array [1, 2, 3, 4].

3. The variance formula for a population is:
   var = sum((x_i - mean)^2) / N

   The mean of [1, 2, 3, 4] is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 10/4 = 2.5

   Now, compute squared differences:
   (1-2.5)^2 = 2.25
   (2-2.5)^2 = 0.25
   (3-2.5)^2 = 0.25
   (4-2.5)^2 = 2.25

   Sum: 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5

   Divide by N=4: 5/4 = 1.25

4. The result is rounded to 2 decimal places: round(1.25, 2) = 1.25

So the output is 1.25.
