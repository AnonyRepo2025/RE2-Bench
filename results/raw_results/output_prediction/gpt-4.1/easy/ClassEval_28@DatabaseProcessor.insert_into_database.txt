[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The method `insert_into_database` is called with:
   - self.database_name = "test.db"
   - table_name = "test_table"
   - data = [{"name": "John", "age": 25}, {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}]

2. The function connects to the SQLite database "test.db".

3. It creates a cursor.

4. For each item in data:
   - It executes the query: `INSERT INTO test_table (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)` with the values from the item.

5. After inserting all items, it commits and closes the connection.

6. The function does not return anything (no return statement).

Therefore, the output is `null` (or `None` in Python), but since the output is in JSON, it should be `null`.
