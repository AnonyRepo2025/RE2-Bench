[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `f` takes a string as input.
2. It first applies `string.title()`. The `title()` method capitalizes the first letter of each word (where words are separated by whitespace or certain punctuation), and lowercases the rest.
   - The input string is: "1oE-err bzz-bmm"
   - Applying `title()`:
     - "1oE-err" becomes "1Oe-Err" (the first character after a non-letter is capitalized, and the rest are lowercased)
     - "bzz-bmm" becomes "Bzz-Bmm"
     - So, the result is: "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm"
3. Next, `.replace(' ', '')` removes all spaces from the string.
   - "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm" becomes "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"
4. The function returns "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm".
