Let's simulate the function step by step with the given input:

Inputs:
- line = "$78"
- char = "$"

Step 1: count = line.count(char)
- line = "$78"
- char = "$"
- "$78".count("$") = 1
So, count = 1

Step 2: for i in range(count + 1, 0, -1):
- count + 1 = 2
- range(2, 0, -1) gives [2, 1]

So, the loop will run for i = 2, then i = 1.

Initial line: "$78"

First iteration (i = 2):
- line = line.center(len(line) + i // len(char), char)
- len(line) = 3
- len(char) = 1
- i // len(char) = 2 // 1 = 2
- len(line) + i // len(char) = 3 + 2 = 5
- line.center(5, "$")
- "$78".center(5, "$") â†’ The string is padded to length 5 with "$" on both sides.
- "$78" is length 3, so 2 more characters needed.
- By Python's str.center, the extra characters are split as evenly as possible between left and right. If odd, left gets the extra.
- 2 extra: 1 left, 1 right.
- Result: "$$78$"

Second iteration (i = 1):
- line = "$$78$"
- len(line) = 5
- i // len(char) = 1 // 1 = 1
- len(line) + i // len(char) = 5 + 1 = 6
- "$$78$".center(6, "$")
- "$$78$" is length 5, so 1 more character needed.
- 1 extra: goes to the left.
- Result: "$$$78$"

After the loop, return line.

So, the final output is "$$$78$".
