[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

1. The function `f(dic)` takes a dictionary as input.
2. It returns `sorted(dic.items(), key=lambda x: x[0])`.
   - `dic.items()` returns a view of the dictionary's items as (key, value) pairs.
   - `sorted(..., key=lambda x: x[0])` sorts these pairs by the key (the first element of each tuple).
3. The input dictionary is: {"b": 1, "a": 2}
4. `dic.items()` will produce: [("b", 1), ("a", 2)] (order in dicts is insertion order, but for sorting, it doesn't matter).
5. Sorting by key:
   - "a" comes before "b" alphabetically.
   - So, after sorting: [("a", 2), ("b", 1)]
6. The function returns this sorted list of tuples.

Therefore, the output should be:
[("a", 2), ("b", 1)]
