[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step with the given input:

Inputs:
- s = "urecord"
- l = 8

Step 1: s.ljust(l, '=')
- "urecord" has length 7.
- l = 8, so we need to pad it with 1 '=' character to the right.
- Result: "urecord="

Step 2: .rpartition('=')
- "urecord=" is partitioned at the last occurrence of '='.
- .rpartition('=') returns a tuple: (before, sep, after)
- before = "urecord", sep = "=", after = ""
- The function returns [0], which is the part before the last '=': "urecord"

So the output is "urecord".
