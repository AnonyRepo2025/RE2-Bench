[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function with the given input:

1. The input is `nums = []` (an empty list).
2. `asc, desc = (nums.copy(), [])`
   - `asc` is a copy of `nums`, so `asc = []`
   - `desc` is initialized as an empty list: `desc = []`
3. `asc.reverse()`
   - Reversing an empty list does nothing, so `asc` remains `[]`
4. `desc = asc[:len(asc) // 2]`
   - `len(asc)` is 0, so `len(asc) // 2` is 0
   - `asc[:0]` is `[]`, so `desc` is still `[]`
5. `return desc + asc + desc`
   - All three lists are empty, so the result is `[] + [] + [] = []`

So the output is an empty list.
