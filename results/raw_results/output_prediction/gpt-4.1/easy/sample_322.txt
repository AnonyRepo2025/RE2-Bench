[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step with the given input:

Input:
chemicals = ["lsi", "s", "t", "t", "d"]
num = 0

Step 1: fish = chemicals[1:]
This means fish = ["s", "t", "t", "d"]

Step 2: chemicals.reverse()
chemicals becomes ["d", "t", "t", "s", "lsi"]

Step 3: for i in range(num):
Since num = 0, this loop does not execute at all.

Step 4: chemicals.reverse()
chemicals becomes ["lsi", "s", "t", "t", "d"] (back to original order)

Step 5: return chemicals
So the function returns ["lsi", "s", "t", "t", "d"]
