[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The class is initialized with self.file_name = "example.zip".
2. The method extract_file is called with file_name="example5.txt" and output_path="output_directory".
3. The method tries to open "example.zip" as a zip file and extract "example5.txt" to "output_directory".
4. If this succeeds, it returns True. If any exception occurs (e.g., file not found, file not in archive, etc.), it returns False.

However, we are not told whether "example.zip" exists, or whether "example5.txt" is inside it, or whether "output_directory" is writable. Since we are only to predict the output of the function given the code and the input, and there is no information about the actual files, the function is robust to errors and will return False if any error occurs.

But in the context of this question, unless otherwise specified, we usually assume the "happy path" (i.e., the file exists, the zip exists, the file is in the zip, and the output directory is valid). So, the function will return True.

Therefore, the output is True.
