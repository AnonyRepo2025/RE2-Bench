[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:

1. The Warehouse instance has:
   self.inventory = {
       "1": {
           "name": "product 3",
           "quantity": 9
       }
   }
   self.orders = {}

2. The method call is update_product_quantity(product_id=1, quantity=-1).

3. In the method, it checks if product_id in self.inventory. The product_id is 1 (an integer), but the key in self.inventory is "1" (a string). In Python, 1 != "1", so the check fails.

4. Therefore, the body of the if statement is not executed, and nothing happens.

5. The method does not return anything (implicit return None).

So, the output is None.
