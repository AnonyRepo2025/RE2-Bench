[THOUGHT]
We are given a VendingMachine instance with self.balance = 5.0 and self.inventory = {}. The method insert_coin is called with amount = 1.25.

Step by step:
1. self.balance is currently 5.0.
2. insert_coin(1.25) will add 1.25 to self.balance.
3. self.balance becomes 5.0 + 1.25 = 6.25.
4. The method returns self.balance, which is now 6.25.

So the output should be 6.25.
