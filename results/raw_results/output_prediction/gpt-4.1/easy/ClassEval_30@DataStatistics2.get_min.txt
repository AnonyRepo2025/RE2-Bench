[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and input step by step.

1. The class DataStatistics2 is initialized with a data argument, which is converted to a numpy array.
2. The get_min method returns np.min(self.data), which is the minimum value in the array.

Input:
- self.data is "[ 0 -1 -3  2]". This is a string representation of a numpy array. In practice, when the class is initialized, it would be passed as a list or array, but for this simulation, we interpret it as the array [0, -1, -3, 2].

So, self.data = np.array([0, -1, -3, 2])

np.min([0, -1, -3, 2]) = -3

Therefore, the output is -3.
