[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f`:

1. The function takes two arguments: `list` and `operation`.
2. It creates a shallow copy of `list` called `new_list`.
   - `new_list = list[:]` means `new_list` is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
3. It sorts `new_list` in place.
   - After `new_list.sort()`, `new_list` becomes `[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`.
4. It calls `operation(new_list)`. We don't know what the lambda does, but since it is not modifying `list` (the original), and `new_list` is a copy, unless the lambda has a side effect on the original list (which is not possible here), the original `list` remains unchanged.
5. The function returns `list`, which is the original list passed in.

So, regardless of what the lambda does to `new_list`, the function returns the original list, which is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
