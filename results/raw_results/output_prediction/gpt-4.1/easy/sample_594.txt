[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

1. The function `f` takes a single argument `file` and returns `file.index('\n')`.
2. The `str.index(sub)` method returns the lowest index in the string where substring `sub` is found. If not found, it raises a ValueError.
3. The input string is: "n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n.\n"
4. We need to find the index of the first occurrence of the newline character `\n` in this string.
5. Let's count the characters:
   - "n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n." is the part before the newline.
   - Let's count the number of characters before the newline:
     - "n" (1)
     - " " (2)
     - "w" (3)
     - "e" (4)
     - "z" (5)
     - " " (6)
     - "s" (7)
     - "z" (8)
     - "i" (9)
     - "z" (10)
     - "e" (11)
     - " " (12)
     - "l" (13)
     - "n" (14)
     - "s" (15)
     - "o" (16)
     - "n" (17)
     - " " (18)
     - "t" (19)
     - "i" (20)
     - "l" (21)
     - "e" (22)
     - "b" (23)
     - "i" (24)
     - " " (25)
     - "i" (26)
     - "t" (27)
     - " " (28)
     - "5" (29)
     - "0" (30)
     - "4" (31)
     - "n" (32)
     - "." (33)
   - So, the period is at index 32 (since we start counting from 0), but let's check:
     - Let's use Python's `index` method logic: the first character is at index 0.
     - Let's count the number of characters before the newline:
       - "n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n." is 34 characters (including spaces and the period).
       - So, the newline character is at index 34.
6. Therefore, `file.index('\n')` will return 34.
