[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step.

The function f takes a list nums and iterates over it by index. For each element, if it is divisible by 3, it appends that element to the end of the list. The loop runs for the original length of the list (since range(len(nums)) is evaluated once at the start).

Initial nums: [1, 3, 3]
len(nums) at start: 3

Let's go through the loop:

i = 0:
    nums[0] = 1
    1 % 3 == 1, so nothing happens.

i = 1:
    nums[1] = 3
    3 % 3 == 0, so append 3 to nums.
    nums is now [1, 3, 3, 3]

i = 2:
    nums[2] = 3
    3 % 3 == 0, so append 3 to nums.
    nums is now [1, 3, 3, 3, 3]

The loop only goes up to i = 2 (since range(3)), so the two appended 3s at the end are not checked.

Return nums: [1, 3, 3, 3, 3]
