[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function _validate_phoneNumber with input "jgdjrj".

1. The function checks if not phoneNumber. "jgdjrj" is not empty, so continue.
2. Next, it checks if len(phoneNumber) != 11 or not phoneNumber.isdigit():
   - len("jgdjrj") = 6, which is not 11, so this condition is True.
   - Also, "jgdjrj".isdigit() is False, but since the length check already failed, the or condition is True.
3. Since the condition is True, the function returns None.

So, the output is None.
