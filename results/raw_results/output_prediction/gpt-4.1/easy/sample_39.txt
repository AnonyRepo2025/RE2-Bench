[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the given input.

Inputs:
- array = [6, 2, 7, 1]
- elem = 6

Step 1: The function checks if `elem` (6) is in `array` ([6, 2, 7, 1]). 6 is indeed present in the array.
Step 2: Since 6 is in the array, the function returns `array.index(6)`. The index of 6 in the array is 0 (since Python uses 0-based indexing).
Step 3: The function returns 0.

Therefore, the output is 0.
