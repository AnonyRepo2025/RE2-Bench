[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step.

The function f(nums) iterates from the second-to-last element down to the first element (i from len(nums)-2 to 0, inclusive, stepping -1). For each i, if nums[i] is even, it removes the value nums[i] from the list (using nums.remove(nums[i])). Note: nums.remove(x) removes the first occurrence of x in the list.

Given input:
nums = [5, 3, 3, 7]

Let's compute len(nums) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2. So i will go from 2 down to 0.

So the loop is: for i in [2, 1, 0]:

Step 1: i = 2
nums[2] = 3
3 % 2 == 1 (odd), so do nothing.

Step 2: i = 1
nums[1] = 3
3 % 2 == 1 (odd), so do nothing.

Step 3: i = 0
nums[0] = 5
5 % 2 == 1 (odd), so do nothing.

At no point is an even number found, so the list is never modified.

Return nums, which is still [5, 3, 3, 7].
