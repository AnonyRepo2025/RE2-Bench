[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step:

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `arr1` and `arr2`.
2. It creates a copy of `arr1` and assigns it to `new_arr`. So, `new_arr` is `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]`.
3. It then extends `new_arr` with the elements of `arr2`. `arr2` is `["", 0, -1, []]`.
4. Extending means appending each element of `arr2` to the end of `new_arr`, so after extension, `new_arr` becomes `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.
5. The function returns `new_arr`.

So, the output will be `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.
