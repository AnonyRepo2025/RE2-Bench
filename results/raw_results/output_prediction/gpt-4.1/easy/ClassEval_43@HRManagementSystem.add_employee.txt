[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and input step by step.

1. The HRManagementSystem class has an employees dictionary.
2. The add_employee method checks if the given employee_id is already in self.employees. If so, it returns False. Otherwise, it adds the employee and returns True.
3. In the input, self.employees is:
{
    "1": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "HR",
        "salary": 5000
    }
}
But the key is the string "1", not the integer 1.

4. The method is called with employee_id=1 (an integer).
5. In Python, "1" (string) and 1 (int) are different keys in a dictionary.
6. So, 1 in self.employees will be False, because the only key is "1" (string).
7. Therefore, the method will add a new entry with key 1 (int), and return True.
