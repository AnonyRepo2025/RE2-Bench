[THOUGHT]
The function generate_email_pattern is a method of the RegexUtils class. It does not use any arguments or instance variables. When called, it simply returns the string '\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'. This is a regular expression pattern for matching email addresses. The returned value is the string as written in the code.
