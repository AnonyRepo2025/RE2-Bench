[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:

1. The method is check_in(room_type="single", room_number=2, name="guest 1").
2. self.booked_rooms = {"single": {}}.
3. First, it checks if room_type ("single") is in self.booked_rooms.keys(). It is, so continue.
4. Next, it checks if name ("guest 1") is in self.booked_rooms[room_type] (which is self.booked_rooms["single"], which is an empty dict).
5. "guest 1" is not in the dict, so this condition is False, and the function does not enter the if block.
6. The function reaches the end without a return statement, so it returns None by default.
