[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input:

The function `car_race_collision` takes a single integer argument `n` and returns `n ** 2`, which is n squared.

Given the input:
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "n": 8
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}

We see that `n` is 8.

So, the function will compute 8 ** 2, which is 64.

Therefore, the output should be 64.
