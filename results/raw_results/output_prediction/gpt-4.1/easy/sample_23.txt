[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step with the given input:

Inputs:
- text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"
- chars = "0123456789-"

Step 1: Check if chars is truthy. It is "0123456789-", which is a non-empty string, so it's truthy.

Step 2: Execute `text = text.rstrip(chars)`. The `rstrip` method removes all trailing characters that are in the set of characters provided, from the end of the string, until it finds a character not in the set.

So, let's look at the end of the string:
"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"

The last character is "2", which is in "0123456789-". So it is removed.
Now the string is: "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."

Now the last character is ".", which is not in "0123456789-". So the rstrip stops here.

So, after rstrip, text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."

Step 3: Check if text == ''. It is not empty.

Step 4: Return text.

So the output is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."
