[THOUGHT]
The function `read_file_as_json` opens the file at `self.file_path` (which is "test_2.txt") and loads its contents as JSON using `json.load(file)`. The output will be the parsed JSON object from the file.

However, the actual content of "test_2.txt" is not provided in the input. Since the function simply returns the parsed JSON, and we have no information about the file's contents, we cannot determine the exact output value. 

If the file contained, for example, `{"foo": 42}`, the output would be `{"foo": 42}`. But since the file content is unknown, the output is indeterminate from the information given.

If the intent is to simulate the function's behavior, the output would be whatever JSON is in "test_2.txt". But since we don't know, the best we can do is to indicate that the output depends on the file's contents.
