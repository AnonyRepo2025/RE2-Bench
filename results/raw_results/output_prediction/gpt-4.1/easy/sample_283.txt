[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step with the given input.

Inputs:
- dictionary = {
    "Captain America": 3,
    "Black Panther": 0,
    "Thor": 1,
    "Ant-Man": 6
  }
- key = "Iron Man"

Step 1: del dictionary[key]
- The function tries to delete the entry with key "Iron Man" from the dictionary.
- However, "Iron Man" is NOT a key in the dictionary.
- In Python, attempting to delete a key that does not exist in a dictionary with `del` raises a KeyError.

Therefore, the function will raise a KeyError and will not proceed further.

The output should reflect that an exception is raised, but the structure only asks for "output": XXX. Since the function does not return normally, the output is an error.

If the intention is to show the exception, the output should be the exception message, which is the string of the missing key: 'Iron Man'.

But if the structure expects only the return value, and the function does not return, then the output is an error.

Assuming the output should be the exception message.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "KeyError: 'Iron Man'"        
}
