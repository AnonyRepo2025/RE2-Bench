[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the input `text = "?XyZ"`.

1. Initialize `uppers = 0`.
2. Iterate over each character in `text`:
   - First character: '?'
     - '?'.isupper() is False, so `uppers` remains 0.
   - Second character: 'X'
     - 'X'.isupper() is True, so `uppers` becomes 1.
   - Third character: 'y'
     - 'y'.isupper() is False, so `uppers` remains 1.
   - Fourth character: 'Z'
     - 'Z'.isupper() is True, so `uppers` becomes 2.
3. After the loop, `uppers = 2`.
4. The function returns `text.upper()` if `uppers >= 10`, else returns `text`.
   - Since `uppers = 2` which is less than 10, the function returns the original `text`, which is "?XyZ".
