[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with input `st = "Hi there"`.

1. The function first converts `st` to lowercase: `"hi there"`.
2. It finds the last index of `'i'` in `"hi there"` using `rindex('i')`. 
   - `"hi there"`: positions are h(0), i(1),  (2), t(3), h(4), e(5), r(6), e(7)
   - The last `'i'` is at index 1.
3. Now, it finds the last index of `'h'` in `"hi there"`, but starting the search at the index of the last `'i'` (which is 1). So, `rindex('h', 1)` means: find the last `'h'` in `"hi there"` from position 1 to the end.
   - The `'h'` at index 0 is before 1, so not included.
   - The next `'h'` is at index 4.
   - So, `st.lower().rindex('h', 1)` returns 4.
4. Now, the function checks if this index (4) is greater than or equal to the index of the last `'i'` (1): `4 >= 1` is True.
5. Therefore, the function returns `'Hey'`.
