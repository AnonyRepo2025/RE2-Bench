[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

1. The function `f(nums, fill)` takes a list `nums` and a value `fill`.
2. It uses `dict.fromkeys(nums, fill)` to create a dictionary where each key is an element from `nums`, and each value is `fill`.
3. The input `nums` is `[0, 1, 1, 2]` and `fill` is `"abcca"`.
4. `dict.fromkeys` will iterate through `nums` and add each as a key, with the value `fill`. If a key appears multiple times, only the last occurrence matters (but in practice, keys are unique in a dict, so duplicates are ignored).
5. So, the resulting dictionary will have keys: 0, 1, 2, each with value `"abcca"`.

So the output will be:
{
    "0": "abcca",
    "1": "abcca",
    "2": "abcca"
}
