[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

1. The function `f(a, b)` returns `{**a, **b}`. This is Python's dictionary unpacking syntax, which creates a new dictionary by merging the key-value pairs from `a` and `b`. If there are duplicate keys, the value from the later dictionary (`b`) will overwrite the value from the earlier one (`a`).

2. The input provides:
   - `a = {"w": 5, "wi": 10}`
   - `b = {"w": 3}`

3. When merging:
   - Start with all key-value pairs from `a`: `{"w": 5, "wi": 10}`
   - Then add all key-value pairs from `b`. If a key already exists, its value is overwritten.
   - `b` has `"w": 3`, which overwrites `"w": 5` from `a`.
   - `"wi": 10` from `a` is not present in `b`, so it remains unchanged.

4. The resulting dictionary is: `{"w": 3, "wi": 10}`.
