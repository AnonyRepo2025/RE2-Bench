[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:
- The SignInSystem instance has self.users = {"user1": True}
- sign_in("user1") is called.
- The method checks if "user1" is in self.users. It is.
- Then, it sets self.users["user1"] = True (which it already is).
- Then, it returns True.

So the output will be True.
