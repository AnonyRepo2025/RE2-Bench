[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and the input step by step.

1. The class CamelCaseMap has a __delitem__ method, which deletes an item from self._data using a converted key.
2. The _convert_key method checks if the key is a string, and if so, calls self._to_camel_case(key). Otherwise, it returns the key as is.
3. However, in the provided code, there is no definition for _to_camel_case. This means that if we try to call __delitem__ with a string key, it will attempt to call self._to_camel_case, which does not exist, resulting in an AttributeError.
4. The input provides self._data as an empty dictionary, and the key is "first_name".
5. When __delitem__ is called, it will try to delete self._data[self._convert_key("first_name")]. _convert_key will try to call self._to_camel_case("first_name"), which will raise an AttributeError: 'CamelCaseMap' object has no attribute '_to_camel_case'.

Therefore, the output will be an exception, specifically an AttributeError.
