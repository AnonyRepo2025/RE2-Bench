Let's simulate the function step by step.

1. The HRManagementSystem instance has self.employees = {
    "1": {
        "name": "John",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 100000
    }
}
2. list_employees() is called.
3. employee_data = {} is initialized.
4. Since self.employees is not empty, we enter the if block.
5. For each employee_id, employee_info in self.employees.items():
   - employee_id = "1"
   - employee_info = {
        "name": "John",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 100000
     }
6. employee_details = {}
7. employee_details['employee_ID'] = employee_id → employee_details['employee_ID'] = "1"
8. For each key, value in employee_info.items():
   - key = "name", value = "John" → employee_details["name"] = "John"
   - key = "position", value = "Manager" → employee_details["position"] = "Manager"
   - key = "department", value = "Sales" → employee_details["department"] = "Sales"
   - key = "salary", value = 100000 → employee_details["salary"] = 100000
9. employee_details now is:
   {
     "employee_ID": "1",
     "name": "John",
     "position": "Manager",
     "department": "Sales",
     "salary": 100000
   }
10. employee_data[employee_id] = employee_details
    So employee_data = {
      "1": {
        "employee_ID": "1",
        "name": "John",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 100000
      }
    }
11. Return employee_data.

So the output will be:
{
    "1": {
        "employee_ID": "1",
        "name": "John",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 100000
    }
}

{
    "1": {
        "employee_ID": "1",
        "name": "John",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 100000
    }
}
```
