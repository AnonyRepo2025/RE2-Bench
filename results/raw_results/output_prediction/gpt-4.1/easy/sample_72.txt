[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the input `text = "99"`.

1. The function iterates over each character `c` in `text`.
2. For each character, it checks if `c.isnumeric()` is False. If so, it returns False immediately.
3. If all characters are numeric, it returns `bool(text)` at the end.

Let's check each character:
- First character: '9'. '9'.isnumeric() is True, so continue.
- Second character: '9'. '9'.isnumeric() is True, so continue.

After the loop, since all characters are numeric, we reach `return bool(text)`.
- `bool("99")` is True because the string is non-empty.

So, the function will return True.
