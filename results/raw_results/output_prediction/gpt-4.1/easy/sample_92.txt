[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

1. The function `f` takes a single argument `text` and returns `text.isascii()`.
2. The method `str.isascii()` returns True if all characters in the string are ASCII (i.e., their Unicode code point is less than 128), and False otherwise.
3. The input string is: "wW\uc758IV]HDJjhgK[dGIUlVO@Ess$coZkBqu[Ct"
4. Let's look for any non-ASCII characters in the string. The sequence `\uc758` is a Unicode escape sequence. In Python, `\u` followed by four hex digits represents a Unicode character. `\uc758` is the Hangul character 'Ïùò', which is not an ASCII character.
5. Since the string contains at least one non-ASCII character, `text.isascii()` will return False.
