[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:
1. The URLHandler is initialized with url = "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#aaa".
2. get_fragment() is called.
3. It finds the index of '#' in the URL. In this string, '#' is at position 39 (counting from 0).
4. Since fragment_start != -1, it returns self.url[fragment_start + 1:], which is self.url[40:].
5. The substring starting at index 40 is "aaa".
6. So, the output will be "aaa".
