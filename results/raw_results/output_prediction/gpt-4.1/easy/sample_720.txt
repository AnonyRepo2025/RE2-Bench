[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step.

Inputs:
- items = ["bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf", "n"]
- item = "n"

Step 1: The function enters a while loop: while items[-1] == item:
- items[-1] is "n", which is equal to item ("n"), so the loop body executes.
- items.pop() removes the last element, so items becomes ["bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf"]

Step 2: The while loop checks again: items[-1] is now "bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf", which is not equal to "n", so the loop exits.

Step 3: items.append(item) appends "n" to the list, so items becomes ["bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf", "n"]

Step 4: return len(items) returns the length of the list, which is 2.

So the output is 2.
