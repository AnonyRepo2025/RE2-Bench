Let's simulate the function step by step.

Inputs:
- full = "hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy"
- part = "hr"

1. length = len(part) = 2
2. index = full.find(part) = "hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy".find("hr") = 0 (since "hr" is at the very start)
3. count = 0

Enter the while loop (index >= 0):

First iteration:
- full = full[index + length:] = full[0 + 2:] = full[2:] = "siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy"
- index = full.find(part) = "siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy".find("hr") = "hr" occurs at index 9 (since "siajiajiei" is 9 chars, then "hr" starts)
- count += 1 => count = 1

Second iteration:
- full = full[index + length:] = full[9 + 2:] = full[11:] = "uejfhbrisvlmmy"
- index = full.find(part) = "uejfhbrisvlmmy".find("hr") = "hr" does not occur, so index = -1
- count += 1 => count = 2

Exit loop (index < 0).

Return count = 2.
