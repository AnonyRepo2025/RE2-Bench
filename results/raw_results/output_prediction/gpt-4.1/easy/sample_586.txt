[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `char`.
2. It returns `text.rindex(char)`. The `rindex` method returns the highest index in the string where substring `char` is found. If the substring is not found, it raises a ValueError.
3. The input is:
   - text: "breakfast"
   - char: "e"
4. Let's look for the last occurrence of "e" in "breakfast":
   - "b" (0)
   - "r" (1)
   - "e" (2)
   - "a" (3)
   - "k" (4)
   - "f" (5)
   - "a" (6)
   - "s" (7)
   - "t" (8)
5. The only occurrence of "e" is at index 2. So the last (and only) occurrence is at index 2.
6. Therefore, the function will return 2.
