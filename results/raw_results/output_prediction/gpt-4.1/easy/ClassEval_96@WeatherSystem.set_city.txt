[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and the input:

- The WeatherSystem class has an __init__ method that sets self.city, self.temperature, self.weather, and self.weather_list.
- The set_city method simply sets self.city = city.

Given the input:
- self: temperature=None, weather=None, city="New York", weather_list={}
- args: city="Beijing"

When set_city is called, it will set self.city to "Beijing". The method does not return anything (no return statement), so it implicitly returns None.

Therefore, the output should be None.
