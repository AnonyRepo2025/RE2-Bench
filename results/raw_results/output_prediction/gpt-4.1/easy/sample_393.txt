[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with input `text="scala"`.

1. `ls = text[::-1]` reverses the string "scala" to "alacs".
2. `text2 = ''` initializes an empty string.
3. The for loop: `for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3):`
   - `len(ls)` is 5, so `len(ls) - 3` is 2.
   - The range is `range(2, 0, -3)`, which means it starts at 2, stops before 0, and steps by -3.
   - The only value for `i` in this range is 2.
4. Inside the loop for `i=2`:
   - `ls[i:i+3]` is `ls[2:5]` (since i=2, i+3=5).
   - `ls` is "alacs", so:
     - ls[2] = 'a'
     - ls[3] = 'c'
     - ls[4] = 's'
     - So, ls[2:5] = ['a', 'c', 's']
   - `'---'.join(ls[2:5])` is "a---c---s"
   - Add '---' at the end: "a---c---s---"
   - `text2` becomes "a---c---s---"
5. The loop ends (since the next value would be -1, which is not >= 0).
6. The function returns `text2[:-3]`, which removes the last 3 characters from "a---c---s---".
   - "a---c---s---" is 11 characters; removing the last 3 gives "a---c---s"
7. So, the output is "a---c---s".
