[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step with the given inputs:
- number = 4
- need = 8
- remaining = 9

The function logic is:
if need <= remaining:
    return [number + need, remaining - need]
else:
    return [number + remaining, 0]

Check if need <= remaining:
8 <= 9 is True.

So, we execute:
return [number + need, remaining - need]
number + need = 4 + 8 = 12
remaining - need = 9 - 8 = 1

So the output is [12, 1].
