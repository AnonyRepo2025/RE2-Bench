[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes a string `text` as input.
2. It does: `''.join(list(text))`. 
   - `list(text)` turns the string into a list of its characters. For " \t  \u3000", this is [' ', '\t', ' ', ' ', '\u3000'].
   - `''.join(...)` joins these characters back into a string, so the result is the same as the input: " \t  \u3000".
3. Then, it calls `.isspace()` on the resulting string.
   - The `.isspace()` method returns True if all characters in the string are whitespace and there is at least one character.
   - The input string is " \t  \u3000", which consists of:
     - ' ' (space)
     - '\t' (tab)
     - ' ' (space)
     - ' ' (space)
     - '\u3000' (IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE, which is considered whitespace in Python)
   - All of these are whitespace characters.
4. Therefore, `''.join(list(text)).isspace()` will return True.
