Let's simulate the function step by step.

Inputs:
- text = "zbzquiuqnmfkx"
- chars = "mk"

The function sets:
- num_applies = 2
- extra_chars = ''

Loop for i in range(num_applies): (i.e., i = 0, 1)

First iteration (i=0):
- extra_chars += chars → extra_chars = "" + "mk" = "mk"
- text = text.replace(extra_chars, '')
  - text = "zbzquiuqnmfkx".replace("mk", '')
  - "mk" appears at position 9-10 in "zbzquiuqnmfkx" (the substring is "mfk", so "mk" is not present as a substring, only "mfk" is, but not "mk" by itself).
  - Let's check: "zbzquiuqnmfkx"
    - "mk" is not present as a substring.
  - So, text remains "zbzquiuqnmfkx"

Second iteration (i=1):
- extra_chars += chars → extra_chars = "mk" + "mk" = "mkmk"
- text = text.replace(extra_chars, '')
  - text = "zbzquiuqnmfkx".replace("mkmk", '')
  - "mkmk" is not present in the string.
  - So, text remains "zbzquiuqnmfkx"

After the loop, return text.

So, the output is "zbzquiuqnmfkx".
