[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f(items, target)` with the provided input.

- `items` is the list: ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]
- `target` is the string: "**"

The function checks if `target` is in `items`. Let's look for "**" in the list:
- Index 0: "1" (not a match)
- Index 1: "+" (not a match)
- Index 2: "-" (not a match)
- Index 3: "**" (this is a match)

So, "**" is found at index 3.

The function then returns `items.index(target)`, which will return 3.

If the target was not found, it would return -1, but in this case, it is found.

Therefore, the output is 3.
