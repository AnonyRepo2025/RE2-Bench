[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the given inputs:
- text = "mathematics"
- suffix = "example"

1. The function first checks if `suffix` is truthy (not empty or None) and if `text.endswith(suffix)` is True.
2. "example" is a non-empty string, so the first part of the condition is True.
3. Now, does "mathematics" end with "example"? No, "mathematics" does not end with "example".
4. Therefore, the condition is False, and the function returns `text` unchanged.

So, the output will be "mathematics".
