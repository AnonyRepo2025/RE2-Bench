[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the input string "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds".

1. The function initializes `ws = 0`.
2. It iterates over each character in the string, and for each character, it checks if it is a whitespace character using `s.isspace()`. If so, it increments `ws`.
3. At the end, it returns a tuple: (number of whitespace characters, length of the string).

Let's count the whitespace characters in the input string:
"jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds"

Let's write out the string and look for spaces:
Positions:
0: j
1: c
2: l
3: e
4:  
5: o
6: q
7:  
8: w
9: s
10: n
11: i
12: b
13: k
14: t
15: x
16: p
17: i
18: o
19: z
20: y
21: x
22: m
23: o
24: p
25: q
26: k
27: f
28: n
29: r
30: f
31: j
32: d
33: s

At position 4, there is a space.
At position 7, there is a space.

So, there are 2 whitespace characters.

Now, let's count the length of the string.
Let's count the number of characters:
"jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds"
Let's count:
j c l e   o q   w s n i b k t x p i o z y x m o p q k f n r f j d s

Let's count the number of characters:
From 0 to 33, that's 34 characters.

So, the function will return (2, 34).
