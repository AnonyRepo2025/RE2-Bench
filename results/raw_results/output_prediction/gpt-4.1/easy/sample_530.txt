[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the given inputs:
- s = "@@@ff"
- ch = "@"

1. The function assigns `sl = s`, so initially, sl = "@@@ff".
2. It checks if `ch` is in `s`. "@" is in "@@@ff", so the condition is True.
3. It then does `sl = s.lstrip(ch)`. `lstrip` removes all leading occurrences of `ch` from the string. So, "@@@ff".lstrip("@") removes all leading "@" characters, resulting in "ff".
4. Next, it checks if `len(sl) == 0`. "ff" has length 2, so this is False.
5. The function returns `sl`, which is "ff".

So, the output is "ff".
