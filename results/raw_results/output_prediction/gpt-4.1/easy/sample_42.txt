[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the given input.

1. The input is `nums = []` (an empty list).
2. The first line in the function is `nums.clear()`. This will clear the list, but since it's already empty, nothing changes: `nums = []`.
3. Next, there is a for loop: `for num in nums:`. Since `nums` is empty, the loop body will not execute at all.
4. After the loop, the function returns `nums`, which is still an empty list.

So, the output will be an empty list.
