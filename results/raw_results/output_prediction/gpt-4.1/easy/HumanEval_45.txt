[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

The function `triangle_area(a, h)` computes the area of a triangle given its base `a` and height `h` using the formula: area = (base * height) / 2.

Given the input:
- a = 10
- h = 8

Plugging these values into the formula:
area = 10 * 8 / 2.0
area = 80 / 2.0
area = 40.0

So, the output should be 40.0.
