[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f`:

1. The function takes a single argument `text`, which is "mrq7y".
2. It initializes `result_list` as `['3', '3', '3', '3']`.
3. The next line checks `if result_list:`. Since `result_list` is a non-empty list, this condition is True.
4. Inside the if block, `result_list.clear()` is called, which empties the list.
5. The function then returns `len(text)`. The input `text` is "mrq7y", which has 5 characters.

So, the function will return 5.
