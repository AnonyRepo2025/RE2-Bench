[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function:

1. The function takes an integer `decimal` as input.
2. It calls `bin(decimal)`, which returns the binary representation of the integer as a string, prefixed with '0b'. For 103, `bin(103)` returns '0b1100111'.
3. `[2:]` slices off the first two characters ('0b'), leaving '1100111'.
4. The function then concatenates 'db' at the start and 'db' at the end, so the result is 'db1100111db'.

Therefore, the output will be 'db1100111db'.
