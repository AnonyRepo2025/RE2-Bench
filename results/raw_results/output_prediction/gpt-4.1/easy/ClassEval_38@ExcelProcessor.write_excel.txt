[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The method write_excel is called with a list of lists (data) and a file name.
2. It creates a new Excel workbook and gets the active sheet.
3. It iterates over each row in data and appends it to the sheet.
4. It saves the workbook to the specified file name and closes the workbook.
5. If all goes well, it returns 1. If any exception occurs, it returns 0.

Given the input:
- data is a list of 4 rows, each a list of 4 elements (header and 3 data rows).
- file_name is "test_data_process.xlsx".

Assuming the environment has write permissions and openpyxl is installed (which is the case for this code to run), there is nothing in the data that would cause an exception. The data is well-formed, and the file name is valid.

Therefore, the function will execute successfully and return 1.
