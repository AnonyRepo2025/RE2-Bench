[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

The function `add(lst)` does the following:
- It iterates over the indices of `lst` starting from 1, up to `len(lst)`, with a step of 2 (i.e., it picks every second element starting from index 1).
- For each such index `i`, it checks if `lst[i] % 2 == 0` (i.e., if the element at that index is even).
- If so, it includes `lst[i]` in a list.
- Finally, it sums up all such elements and returns the sum.

Given input:
lst = [4, 4, 6, 8]

Let's enumerate the indices:
- Index 0: 4
- Index 1: 4
- Index 2: 6
- Index 3: 8

The range in the list comprehension is: `range(1, len(lst), 2)` which is `range(1, 4, 2)` → [1, 3]

So, the indices considered are 1 and 3.

Now, check if `lst[1]` and `lst[3]` are even:
- lst[1] = 4 → 4 % 2 == 0 → True (include 4)
- lst[3] = 8 → 8 % 2 == 0 → True (include 8)

So, the list to sum is [4, 8].

Sum: 4 + 8 = 12

So, the output is 12.
