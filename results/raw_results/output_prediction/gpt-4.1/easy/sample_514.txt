[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the input text "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-".

1. The function splits the text by whitespace: `text.split()`
   The input string is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"
   Splitting by whitespace gives: ['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-']

2. The function iterates over each item in this list.

First iteration: item = '-stew---corn-and-beans-in'
- It does: 
  text = text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ').replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')
- '-{}'.format(item)' is '--stew---corn-and-beans-in'
- '{}-'.format(item) is '-stew---corn-and-beans-in-'
- text.replace('--stew---corn-and-beans-in', ' ') -- does this substring exist in text?
  Let's check: The text is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"
  Does "--stew---corn-and-beans-in" exist? Let's see:
  The text starts with "-stew---corn-and-beans-in", but not with two dashes.
  So, no replacement occurs for this.
- text.replace('-stew---corn-and-beans-in-', ' ')
  Does "-stew---corn-and-beans-in-" exist? Let's see:
  The text is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"
  There is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in", but not with a trailing dash.
  So, no replacement occurs for this either.
- So, after the first iteration, text remains "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"

Second iteration: item = 'soup-.-'
- '-{}'.format(item) = '-soup-.-'
- '{}-'.format(item) = 'soup-.-'
- text.replace('-soup-.-', ' ')
  Does "-soup-.-" exist in text? Let's see:
  The text is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"
  There is "soup-.-" at the end, but not with a leading dash.
- text.replace('soup-.-', ' ')
  Does "soup-.-" exist? Yes, at the end.
  So, this will replace "soup-.-" with a space.

So, after this replacement, text becomes "-stew---corn-and-beans-in  " (note two spaces at the end).

Now, after the loop, the function returns text.strip('-')
- text is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in  "
- text.strip('-') removes leading and trailing dashes, but not spaces.
- So, leading dash is removed: "stew---corn-and-beans-in  "
- There are no trailing dashes, so nothing more is removed.

So, the final output is "stew---corn-and-beans-in  " (with two spaces at the end).

But let's check: does .strip('-') remove only dashes or also spaces? It only removes dashes, so spaces remain.

Therefore, the output is "stew---corn-and-beans-in  " (with two spaces at the end).
