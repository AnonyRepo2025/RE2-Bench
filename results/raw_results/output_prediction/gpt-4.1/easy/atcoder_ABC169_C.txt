[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the code step by step:

1. The code reads input from the user: `a, b = input().split()`
   - The input is `"1 0.01"` (the quotes are not part of the input, just for JSON formatting).
   - So, after splitting: `a = "1"`, `b = "0.01"`

2. Next: `b = b[0] + b[2:]`
   - `b[0]` is `"0"`
   - `b[2:]` is from index 2 to the end: `"01"`
   - So, `b = "0" + "01" = "001"`

3. Then: `a = int(a)` → `a = 1`
   - `b = int(b)` → `b = int("001") = 1`

4. Now: `print(a * b // 100)`
   - `a * b = 1 * 1 = 1`
   - `1 // 100 = 0` (integer division)

So the output will be `0`.
