[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the given input.

1. The input is an empty list: `lst = []`.
2. The first line in the function is `lst.clear()`. This will clear the list in place. Since the list is already empty, it remains `[]`.
3. Next, the function enters a for loop: `for i in lst:`. Since `lst` is empty, the loop body will not execute at all.
4. The `else` block attached to the for loop will execute if the loop is not terminated by a `return` or `break`. Since the loop did not execute at all, the `else` block will run.
5. The `else` block returns `True`.

So, the function will return `True`.
