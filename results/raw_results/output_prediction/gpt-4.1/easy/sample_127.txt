[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step:

1. The function `f` takes a single argument `text`.
2. It calls `text.splitlines()`, which splits the string at line boundaries and returns a list of lines.
3. The input string is `"145\n\n12fjkjg"`.
4. Let's see how `splitlines()` works on this string:
   - The string has two newline characters: after "145" and then an empty line, then "12fjkjg".
   - So, splitting:
     - "145" (before first \n)
     - "" (between the two \n)
     - "12fjkjg" (after the second \n)
   - So, the result of `splitlines()` is: `["145", "", "12fjkjg"]`
5. The function then returns `len(s)`, which is the length of the list above.
6. The length is 3.

So, the output should be 3.
