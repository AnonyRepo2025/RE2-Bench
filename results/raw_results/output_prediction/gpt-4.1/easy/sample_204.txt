[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `f` takes a single argument `name`.
2. It returns a list: `[name[0], name[1][::-1][0]]`.

Let's break down the arguments:
- The input is: `"master. "`

First, `name[0]`:
- `name[0]` is the first character of the string `"master. "`, which is `'m'`.

Second, `name[1][::-1][0]`:
- `name[1]` is the second character of the string, which is `'a'`.
- `name[1][::-1]` reverses the string `'a'`, which is still `'a'`.
- `name[1][::-1][0]` is the first character of the reversed string, which is `'a'`.

So, the function returns `['m', 'a']`.
