[THOUGHT]
1. get_format is called with format_type="jS \\o\\f F", lang=None, use_l10n=None.
2. Since use_l10n is None, the code does:
     try: use_l10n = settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL
   That attribute exists (it's a method), so use_l10n is set to that method object (truthy).
3. Because use_l10n is truthy and lang is None, lang = get_language(), but the actual lang value is irrelevant since format_type lookup will fall back.
4. format_type is converted to str, remaining "jS \\o\\f F".
5. _format_cache has no entry, so val=None.
6. Since use_l10n is truthy, it tries to find an attribute named "jS \\o\\f F" in format modules â€“ none is found, so val stays None.
7. Because val is still None, it checks if format_type is in FORMAT_SETTINGS. It is not.
8. Therefore the function returns format_type itself, i.e. "jS \\o\\f F".
