[THOUGHT]
1. func is the string "<function unlink>", not one of the real os.rmdir, os.remove, os.unlink or os.open functions.
2. excinfo is just an empty dict, so extracting exc = excinfo[1] would not yield a FileNotFoundError or PermissionError.
3. Since func is not in the allowed set and exc is not a FileNotFoundError handled specially, the function will hit the branch that warns and returns False.
4. Therefore, on_rm_rf_error returns False.
