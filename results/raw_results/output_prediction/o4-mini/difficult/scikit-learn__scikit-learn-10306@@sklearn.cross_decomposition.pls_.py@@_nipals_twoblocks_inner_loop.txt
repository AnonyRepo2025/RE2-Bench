We need to run `_nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop` on

  X = array([[ -0.3400563 ,  0.10832985,  0.37518837],
             [  0.29390487, -0.03694377, -0.34970456],
             [  0.13679135, -0.1529668 , -0.10183731],
             [ -0.09063993,  0.08158072,  0.07635349]])
  Y = array([[ -2.22044605e-16, -2.49032012e-02],
             [  3.33066907e-16,  5.86106290e-02],
             [ -3.33066907e-16, -6.15542361e-02],
             [  4.44089210e-16,  2.78468082e-02]])

with mode='B', tol=1e-6, max_iter=500, norm_y_weights=True.

Step 1 (initialization):
 y_score = Y[:,[0]] = very small (~1e-16) column
 x_weights_old = 0
 ite = 1

Step 2 (first iteration):
  – mode='B' ⇒ x_weights = pinv(X) · y_score  
    Because y_score≈0 ⇒ raw x_weights≈0 ⇒ ‖x_weights‖² < eps ⇒
    x_weights ← x_weights + eps ⇒ a vector [eps,eps,eps]
  – normalize x_weights to unit length ⇒ each component ≃ 1/(√3+1) ≃ 0.3660  
  – x_score = X · x_weights ≃ [0.05252, –0.03394, –0.04319, 0.02462]  
  – mode='B' ⇒ y_weights = pinv(Y) · x_score  
    Numerically this collapses onto the second dimension ⇒ before normalization y_weights≈[0,0.00724]  
    after `norm_y_weights=True` ⇒ y_weights ≃ [0,1]  
  – y_score = Y · y_weights/(‖y_weights‖²+eps) = the second column of Y:  
        [–0.0249032, 0.0586106, –0.0615542, 0.0278468]  
  – compute x_weights_diff = x_weights – x_weights_old = [0.3660,…]  
    ⇒ ‖diff‖² ≃ 0.40… ≫ tol ⇒ continue  
  – set x_weights_old = x_weights, ite = 2

Step 3 (second iteration):
  – x_weights = pinv(X) · y_score  
    → this is the least‐squares regression of y_score on X: raw coeffs ≃ [51.06, 201.3, –17.93]  
    – normalize ⇒ x_weights ≃ [0.2454, 0.9676, –0.0863]  
  – x_score = X · x_weights  
  – y_weights = pinv(Y) · x_score before norm ≃ [0, α] ⇒ normalized ⇒ [0,1] (unchanged)  
  – y_score (unchanged)  
  – x_weights_diff = new – old ≃ [–0.1206, +0.6016, –0.4523], ‖diff‖² ≃0.58≫tol ⇒ continue  
  – ite = 3

Step 4 (third iteration):
  – x_weights = pinv(X) · y_score again ⇒ same solution as iteration 2  
  – so x_weights_diff ≃ 0 ⇒ convergence
  – exit with ite = 3

Final result:
 x_weights ≃ [0.24535407, 0.96762772, –0.08626003]
 y_weights ≃ [0.0, 1.0]
 ite = 3
