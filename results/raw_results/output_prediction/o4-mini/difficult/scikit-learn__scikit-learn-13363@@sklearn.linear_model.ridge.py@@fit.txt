[THOUGHT]
1. In `fit`, since `solver="auto"` is not in `('sag','saga')`, dtype is set to `[np.float64, np.float32]`.
2. `check_X_y` converts the inputs to 2‐D `float64` numpy arrays; nothing changes because the data are already valid.
3. `sample_weight=2.0` is treated as a constant weight of 2 for all samples (after `np.atleast_1d`, it is a 1‐D array of shape `(3,)`).
4. In `_preprocess_data` (with `fit_intercept=True`, `normalize=False`, `copy_X=True`, `return_mean=True`):
   - We form `sw = sqrt(sample_weight) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142` and compute
       X_w = X_orig * sw,   y_w = y_orig * sw.
   - We compute the weighted means
       X_offset = mean(X_w, axis=0) ≈ [–0.9178, –1.3866],
       y_offset = mean(y_w) ≈ –0.7570.
   - We center:
       Xp = X_w − X_offset,
       yp = y_w − y_offset,
     and set X_scale = [1., 1.].
5. We then call `_ridge_regression` on `(Xp, yp)` with `alpha=1`, `solver="auto"`, etc., which for this small dense problem uses the closed‐form
       coef = (XpᵀXp + I)⁻¹ (Xpᵀyp).
   Numerically one finds approximately
       coef ≈ [ 0.1676, –0.5497 ].
   No iterative solver is used, so `n_iter_ = None`.
6. Finally `_set_intercept` does
       intercept_ = y_offset − X_offset ⋅ coef
                 ≈ (−0.7570) − [−0.9178, −1.3866]⋅[0.1676, −0.5497]
                 ≈ −1.3654.
7. All other attributes remain as before.

Putting it all together yields:
