[THOUGHT]
1. We call Pow._eval_is_extended_real(self) with self = {} (a dict), no args.
2. The first line in the method is:
       real_b = self.base.is_extended_real
   Since `self` is a dict, it has no attribute `base`.
3. This immediately raises an AttributeError: `'dict' object has no attribute 'base'`.
4. No further code is executed.
