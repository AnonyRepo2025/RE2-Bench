[THOUGHT]
We are calling Pipeline.fit on an instance whose attributes are:
  steps = None
  memory = None
  verbose = False

The typical implementation of Pipeline.fit simply returns self without mutating these attributes (it would iterate over steps if they existed, fit or transform them, and finally fit the last estimator, but then return self). Since no modifications are made to the attributes in place and fit returns self, the output object still has the same attribute values.

Therefore, the returned Pipeline has:
  steps = None
  memory = None
  verbose = False
