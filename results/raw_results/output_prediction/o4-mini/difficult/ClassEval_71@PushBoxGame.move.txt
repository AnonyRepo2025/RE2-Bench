[THOUGHT]
1. Initial position: player at (1,2), box at (3,2), target at (3,3).
2. Call move('s'):
   - direction 's' → new_player_row = 1 + 1 = 2, new_player_col = 2.
3. Check map[2][2]:
   - map[2] = "# X #", character at index 2 is 'X' (the box), not '#', so movement is allowed.
4. Since (2,2) is not in self.boxes (which is [(3,2)]), this is treated as an empty cell:
   - Update player position to (2,2).
5. No box was moved.
6. Call check_win():
   - Only box is at (3,2), target is at (3,3), so box_on_target_count = 0.
   - target_count = 1, so 0 != 1 → game is not over.
   - Returns False.
7. move returns False.
