[THOUGHT]
1. We call `__add__` on `self` with `_css_lists = None`, `_js_lists = None` and `other` likewise.
2. The first line in `__add__` is `combined = Media()`.  That invokes `Media.__init__()` with no arguments, so inside `__init__`:
   - `media` is `None`, `css` is `None`, `js` is `None`
   - hence `css` is set to `{}` and `js` to `[]`
   - `combined._css_lists` is initialized to `[css]` i.e. `[{}]`
   - `combined._js_lists` is initialized to `[js]` i.e. `[[]]`
3. Next line is `combined._css_lists = self._css_lists[:]`.  However, `self._css_lists` is `None`, so attempting `None[:]` would raise a `TypeError`.
4. In a real Python run this would crash immediately with:
     TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
5. Therefore, there is no successful return value; instead, the operation raises a `TypeError`.
