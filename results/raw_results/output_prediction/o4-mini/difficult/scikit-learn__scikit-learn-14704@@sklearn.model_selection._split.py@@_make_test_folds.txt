[THOUGHT]
The method will return a 1‐D integer array of length equal to `len(y)` (150 in this case), with values in {0,1,2,3,4}.  Because there are exactly 50 samples of each of the three classes (0,1,2) and `n_splits=5`, each class is broken into 5 equal parts of size 10.  The samples are assigned to folds in the order they appear in `y`, so that for each class the first 10 occurrences go to fold 0, the next 10 to fold 1, and so on up to fold 4.

Thus the return value is an array `test_folds` of length 150, where for each index `i`
- if `y[i]==2` (encoded class 0) you get the fold number `floor(rank_within_class0(i)/10)`,
- if `y[i]==1` (encoded class 1) you get `floor(rank_within_class1(i)/10)`,
- if `y[i]==0` (encoded class 2) you get `floor(rank_within_class2(i)/10)`.

That is a numpy array of shape (150,) with 10 zeros, then 10 ones, … per class, interleaved according to the order of `y`.
