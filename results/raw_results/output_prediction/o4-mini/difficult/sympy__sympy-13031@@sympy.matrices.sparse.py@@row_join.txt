[THOUGHT]
We start with a 2×0 sparse matrix A (self) with _smat = {} and a 2×1 (dense) “other” with no non‐zero entries.  

1. In row_join, since self.cols == 0 but self.rows == other.rows, we skip the first special case.  
2. We check row‐dimensions match (2 == 2), OK.  
3. We make a copy A = self.copy(): still rows=2, cols=0, _smat = {}.  
4. other is not a SparseMatrix, so we go into the dense branch. We let b = other._mat, which holds the flat data. Since “other” has no non‐zero entries, each b[k] is 0 (or None interpreted as zero), so v is never truthy and we never add anything to A._smat.  
5. After the loops, we update A.cols += other.cols → 0 + 1 = 1.  

Thus the result is a 2×1 sparse matrix with no stored non‐zero entries.  In dense form all entries are 0.  

Filling into the requested structure (we explicitly show the two positions, both zero, and the final dims):

```
{
    "_smat": {
        "(0, 0)": 0,
        "(1, 0)": 0
    },
    "rows": 2,
    "cols": 1
}
```
