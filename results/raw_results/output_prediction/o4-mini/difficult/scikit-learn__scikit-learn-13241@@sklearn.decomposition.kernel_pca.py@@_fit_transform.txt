We need to execute KernelPCA._fit_transform on the given 5×5 kernel matrix K.  The first step is centering via KernelCenterer:

1. Compute column–means (which equal row–means since K is symmetric):
   m = [2.49606759, 2.50660339, 2.60909995, 1.98395979, 2.66251970]
2. Compute the grand mean:
   m_all = sum(m) / 5 ≈ 2.45165008
3. Centered kernel entries:
   Kc[i,j] = K[i,j] − m[i] − m[j] + m_all

Carrying out these subtractions and summing, one obtains the centered matrix

[[ 0.02090526, −0.02984846,  0.04445677,  0.00073659, −0.03625016],
 [−0.02984846,  0.15811977, −0.10110064, −0.14692452,  0.11975385],
 [ 0.04445677, −0.10110064,  0.57855486, −0.18284347, −0.33906752],
 [ 0.00073659, −0.14692452, −0.18284347,  0.67065840, −0.34162700],
 [−0.03625016,  0.11975385, −0.33906752, −0.34162700,  0.59719083]]

Since we requested 4 components with the 'arpack' solver, the method proceeds to call eigsh on this centered K, computes the top 4 eigenvalues and eigenvectors, applies svd_flip and sorts them, but finally _fit_transform returns the centered kernel matrix Kc itself.

Therefore the output of _fit_transform is the centered 5×5 matrix Kc above.
