[THOUGHT]
1. Call factor_terms with expr = "R3 + R4 + 4050".
2. Inside factor_terms: expr = sympify("R3 + R4 + 4050")  
   → expr becomes the SymPy object Add(R3, R4, Integer(4050)).
3. Call do(expr) where expr is Add(R3, R4, 4050).
4. In do:
   - expr is a Basic and not an Atom, but iterable(expr) is True (Add is iterable over its args).
   - So we enter the branch:
       args = expr.args = (R3, R4, 4050)
       newargs = tuple(do(i) for i in args)
   - For each i in args:
       * i = R3: is Atom → returned unchanged as R3
       * i = R4: is Atom → returned unchanged as R4
       * i = 4050: sympified to Integer(4050), is Atom → returned unchanged
   - newargs == args, so return expr unchanged.
5. factor_terms returns the original Add(R3, R4, 4050), which prints as R3 + R4 + 4050.

Thus the output is the same expression R3 + R4 + 4050.
