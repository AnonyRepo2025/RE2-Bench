[THOUGHT]
1. We call sympify(a="{2.0, 3}", …).  
2. `a` is a Python `str`, so most of the early type‐based branches (numpy, converters, non‐string iterables, etc.) are skipped.  
3. We fall through to the final block: we strip newlines (none here) and call  
     expr = parse_expr("{2.0, 3}", transformations=…, evaluate=True).  
4. `parse_expr` recognizes the `{…}` Python‐set literal and builds a Python `set` whose elements are themselves sympified:  
     – The literal `2.0` becomes a SymPy `Float(2.0)` (printed as `2.0`)  
     – The literal `3` becomes a SymPy `Integer(3)` (printed as `3`)  
   Thus `expr` is the Python set `{2.0, 3}`.  
5. sympify returns this set.  
6. We place that into the output field `_args_set`.
