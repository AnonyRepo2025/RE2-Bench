We call MutableSparseMatrix.col_join on self with rows=0, cols=0 and other with rows=2, cols=1. 

1. In col_join, the very first check is
   if self.rows == 0 and self.cols != other.cols:
     return self._new(0, other.cols, []).col_join(other)

   Here self.rows=0 and self.cols=0, other.cols=1, so 0≠1. We take that branch:
   - self._new(0, other.cols, []) creates a new 0×1 sparse matrix A with no stored entries.
   - We then call A.col_join(other) recursively.

2. In the recursive call, now A.rows=0, A.cols=1, other.rows=2, other.cols=1.
   - The first `if` fails because A.cols == other.cols.
   - We copy A to avoid mutating the original empty‐matrix; the copy still has rows=0, cols=1, _smat={}.
   - We check that B := other is a SparseMatrix instance.  Since it is, we go to the `else` branch:
       for (i,j), v in B._smat.items(): …
     but B._smat is empty, so no entries are copied into A._smat.
   - Finally we do A.rows += B.rows ⇒ A.rows = 0 + 2 = 2, and return A.

3. The result is a 2×1 sparse matrix with no stored non‐zero entries, i.e. _smat = {}.

Hence the final attributes are:
  _smat = {}
  rows  = 2
  cols  = 1
