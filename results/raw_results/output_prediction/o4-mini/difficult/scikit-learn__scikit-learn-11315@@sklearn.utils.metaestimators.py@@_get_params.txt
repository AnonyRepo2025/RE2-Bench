[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate `_BaseComposition._get_params(self, attr, deep=True)` on the given `self`.  

1. First we call  
   out = super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=True)  
   which is `BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=True)`.  
   Its parameter names (from ColumnTransformer’s __init__) include at least  
     – “transformers” → getattr(self, "transformers") is None  
     – “remainder”    → getattr(self, "remainder")    is the StandardScaler‐like object  
     – “n_jobs”       → 1  
     – “transformer_weights” → None  
   Since `deep=True`, for each of these that has a `get_params` method we would flatten its sub‐params;  
   only `remainder` is itself an estimator object (with get_params), so we get:  
     remainder.get_params() → { "with_mean": true, "with_std": false, "copy": true }  
   and BaseEstimator.get_params will:  
     out["remainder__with_mean"] = true  
     out["remainder__with_std"]  = false  
     out["remainder__copy"]      = true  
   then in all cases also set out["transformers"] = None, out["remainder"] = <the object>, out["n_jobs"] = 1, out["transformer_weights"] = None.  

2. Next `_get_params` continues (deep is True), so it does  
     estimators = getattr(self, "_transformers")  
   In `ColumnTransformer` that method returns a list of `(name, transformer)` pairs.  
   By assumption there is one transformer named `"trans1"`, so  
     estimators = [ ("trans1", <some transformer>) ]  
   Then  
     out.update(estimators)  
   will do  
     out["trans1"] = <that transformer>  
   Finally, for each `(name, estimator)` in `estimators`, if that estimator has `get_params`  
   we would further flatten it.  We assume our `trans1` transformer has no further parameters  
   (or at least we don't need to list them here), so no extra keys are added.  

Putting that all together, the resulting dictionary has exactly the keys requested in the structure.  We mirror the input values for each.

```
{
    "n_jobs": 1,
    "remainder__copy": true,
    "remainder__with_mean": true,
    "remainder__with_std": false,
    "remainder": {
        "with_mean": true,
        "with_std": false,
        "copy": true
    },
    "transformer_weights": null,
    "transformers": null,
    "trans1": null
}
