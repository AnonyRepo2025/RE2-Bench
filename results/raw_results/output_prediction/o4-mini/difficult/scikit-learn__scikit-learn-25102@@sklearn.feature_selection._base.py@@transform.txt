1. The call is to `transform(self, X)`.  
2. First, `_get_output_config('transform', estimator=self)['dense']` returns `'default'` (no special config), and `X` has no `.iloc`, so `preserve_X = False`.  
3. `_validate_data` is called with `accept_sparse='csr'`, so the incoming CSC matrix is converted to CSR.  After validation, `X` is a CSR of shape (2, 10) with the same nonzero entries.  
4. Next, `_transform(X)` is called.  In a fully‐fitted selector, `_get_support_mask()` would return a boolean mask of length 10.  Since no mask was provided in the input, the only consistent assumption (to avoid an error) is that all features are supported (`mask = [True]*10`).  
5. Because `mask.any()` is true, we skip the “no features selected” warning and do `safe_indexing(X, mask, axis=1)`, which for a CSR with all‐True mask just returns the CSR unchanged.  
6. Thus the output is the same sparse matrix, now in CSR format, with  
   - shape `_shape = [2, 10]`  
   - `maxprint` unchanged = 50  
   - `data` the nonzero values in row‐major order: `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]`  
   - `indices` the corresponding column indices: row 0 has cols 1–9, row 1 has cols 0–9 → `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`  
   - `indptr` for CSR is `[0, 9, 19]`.  
7. We fill these into the given structure.
