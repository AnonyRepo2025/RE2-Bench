[THOUGHT]
We have the nested function f(rv):

    def f(rv):
        if not rv.is_Mul:
            return rv
        â€¦

Since the provided rv is the SymPy expression exp(2*I*x) + 1, which is an Add, not a Mul, rv.is_Mul is False, so f simply returns rv unchanged.

Therefore the output of f is the same expression: exp(2*I*x) + 1.
