We are calling the Model.delete() method defined above, not a QuerySet delete. Stepping through:

1. delete(self, using=None, keep_parents=False) is invoked.
2. It checks `if self.pk is None`: here `self.pk` is 99998, so no error.
3. It sets `using = using or router.db_for_write(self.__class__, instance=self)`.  
   - Since `using` is None, router.db_for_write will examine hints including `instance._state.db` which is `"default"`, and return `"default"`.  
   So `using = "default"`.
4. It does `collector = Collector(using="default", origin=self)`.
5. It calls `collector.collect([self], ...)`â€”this builds up internal data structures for the to-be-deleted objects.
6. Finally it does `return collector.delete()`.
7. Looking at the provided code snippets, no explicit return value is shown for `Collector.delete()`, so it falls off and returns `None`.
8. Therefore, Model.delete() returns `None`.

Hence the output value for `output` is `null` in JSON.
