[THOUGHT]
We are calling AssocOp._eval_evalf(self, prec=2).

1. The code starts by checking:
   ```
   if isinstance(self, (Mul, Add)):
       …  # special handling for Mul/Add
   ```
   Our `self` is not an Add or Mul instance (it has no args), so this block is skipped.

2. It then does:
   ```
   args = []
   for a in self.args:
       newa = a._eval_evalf(prec)
       if newa is None:
           args.append(a)
       else:
           args.append(newa)
   ```
   Since `self.args` is empty, the loop never runs and `args` remains `[]`.

3. Finally it returns:
   ```
   return self.func(*args)
   ```
   That is `self.func()` with no arguments.  For a Basic-derived class, `self.func` is its class constructor.  Hence we get a new instance of the same class with no arguments—i.e. an empty AssocOp.

Therefore the result is a new AssocOp instance with no args, which we represent as `AssocOp()`.
