[THOUGHT]
1. Call Basic.__eq__(self, other) with self = {} (a dict), other = "I*x" (a string).
2. Check `if self is other`: {} is not "I*x", so False.
3. Check `if type(self) is not type(other)`: dict vs str, so True.
4. Check `isinstance(self, Pow)`: False (self is dict).
5. Check `isinstance(other, Pow)`: False (other is str).
6. Attempt `other = _sympify(other)`: `_sympify("I*x")` parses the string into a Sympy expression (a Mul instance).
7. Now `type(self)` is still dict, `type(other)` is a Sympy Mul; they differ, so return False.
