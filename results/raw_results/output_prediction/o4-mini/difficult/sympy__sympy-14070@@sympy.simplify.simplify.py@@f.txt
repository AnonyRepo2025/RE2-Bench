We call logcombine on the Sympy expression -log(2) + log(3).  
1. Decompose the Add: terms are a₁ = -log(2) (a Mul of -1 and log(2)) and a₂ = log(3).  
2. For a₁ = -1·log(2): we extract one log term log(2) with coefficient list co=[1] and “other factors” ot=[-1], so record in log1[(-1,)] → (co=[1], log(2)).  
3. For a₂ = log(3): record in log1[()] → (co=[], log(3)).  
4. No nested multi-log products (logs list is empty), so move on to “repack” log1 entries:  
   - For key (-1,), we build log(2) from 2**1, giving entry log1[−1] = log(2).  
   - For key (), we build log(3) from 3**1, giving entry log1[1] = log(3).  
5. Now combine any ±-paired keys: we have both key −1 and +1.  Pop them and form  
     other = [ (−1) * log( log1[−1].arg / log1[+1].arg ) ]  
            = [ −1 * log(2/3) ]  
6. Re-assemble as Add(*other) = −log(2/3).  bottom_up will then see the outer Mul(−1, log(2/3)) and re-apply f, but it stays −log(2/3).  

So the final result is the Mul -1·log(2/3), whose .args are (−1, log(2/3)). In the requested JSON structure we list those two pieces as strings.
