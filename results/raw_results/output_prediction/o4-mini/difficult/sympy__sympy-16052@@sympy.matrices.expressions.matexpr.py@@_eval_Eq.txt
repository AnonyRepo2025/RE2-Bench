[THOUGHT]
We are calling MatrixExpr._eval_Eq(self, other) with self = {} and other = {}.

1. First line in `_eval_Eq` is:
       if not isinstance(other, MatrixExpr):
           return False
   Here `other` is a plain dict, not a MatrixExpr instance. Therefore `isinstance(other, MatrixExpr)` is False, so we immediately return False.

No further code is executed.

Thus the output is False.
