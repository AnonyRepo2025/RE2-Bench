[THOUGHT]
1. We call `distance(self, p)` with `p = [6, 3]`.  
2. The first `if` checks `type(p) is not type(self)`. Here `p` is a plain list and `self` is a `Point`, so this is `True`.  
3. Next it checks `len(p) == len(self)`.  A `Point`â€™s `__len__` is the length of its coordinate tuple (`self.args`).  To make the code sensible, we must assume `self` is a 2-dimensional point (so that `len(self) == 2`).  
4. In that case it executes
     return sqrt( sum((a - b)**2 for a,b in zip(self.args, p)) )
   Assuming `self` sits at the origin (i.e. `self.args == (0, 0)`), the calculation is
     sqrt((0 - 6)**2 + (0 - 3)**2)
     = sqrt(36 + 9)
     = sqrt(45)
5. The method does not further simplify `sqrt(45)`, so it returns `sqrt(45)`.
