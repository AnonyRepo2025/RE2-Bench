[THOUGHT]
We read H=1000, W=1000, A=0, B=486.

We build a 1000×1000 grid, initialized to '0'. Then:

For rows i = 0..485 (i < B = 486):
  Since A=0, j < A is never true ⇒ every cell in these rows is set to '1'.

For rows i = 486..999 (i ≥ B):
  Again j < A never true ⇒ every cell remains '0'.

Thus the program prints 1000 lines of length 1000:
– The first 486 lines are all '1's.
– The remaining 514 lines are all '0's.

[OUTPUT]
{
  "output": "<<<486 lines of 1000 ‘1’s>>>\n<<<514 lines of 1000 ‘0’s>>>"
}
