[THOUGHT]
1. The blank (0) is located at position (1, 2) in the given state.
2. The direction is "left", so we swap the blank with the tile to its left.
3. Make a copy of the state:
   [
     [1, 6, 2],
     [7, 8, 0],
     [4, 5, 3]
   ]
4. Swap positions (1,2) and (1,1): 0 â†” 8
5. The new state becomes:
   [
     [1, 6, 2],
     [7, 0, 8],
     [4, 5, 3]
   ]
6. Return this new state.
