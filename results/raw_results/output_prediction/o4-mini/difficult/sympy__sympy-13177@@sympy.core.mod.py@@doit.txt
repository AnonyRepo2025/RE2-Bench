[THOUGHT]
1. We are calling the inner function `doit(p, q)` with p = zoo (the Sympy complex‚Äêinfinity) and q = 0.
2. The very first check in `doit` is:
     if p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or (q is nan):
         return nan
3. For p = zoo, `p.is_infinite` is True.
4. Therefore `doit` immediately returns `nan`.
