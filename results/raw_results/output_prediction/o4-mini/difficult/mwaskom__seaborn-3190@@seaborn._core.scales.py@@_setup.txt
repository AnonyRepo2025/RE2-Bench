[THOUGHT]
1. First, `_setup` does `new = copy(self)`. So `new` is a shallow copy of the input `self` dict-like object.
2. It checks `if new._tick_params is None`: in the input, `_tick_params` is a dict, not `None`, so this branch is skipped.
3. It checks `if new._label_params is None`: in the input, `_label_params` is indeed `None`, so it tries to call `new = new.label()`.  
   However, `new` is just the copied `ContinuousBase`‚Äêlike object whose methods `label()`, `_get_transform()`, etc., are not defined in the given snippet (we only have the class method code, not the `label` implementation).  
4. Even if `label()` existed, the next lines access attributes on `prop`:  
   ```python
       if prop.normed:
           ...
   ```  
   But the provided `prop` in the input is a plain dict `{ "variable": "coordinate" }`. A dict has no attribute `.normed`, so at that line Python will raise an `AttributeError`.
5. Therefore the function never completes normally; it stops with an exception before producing any of the requested output fields.

Because of the missing `normed` attribute on `prop`, `_setup` raises an AttributeError.

{
  "error": "AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'normed'"
