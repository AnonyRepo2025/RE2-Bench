[THOUGHT]
1. process_csv_data is called with N=1 and save_file_name="read_test.csv".  
2. It calls read_csv("read_test.csv"):
   - Opens the file, reads the header row into `title` and the remaining rows into `data` (a list of lists).
3. It builds `column_data` by taking the element at index 1 from each row in `data` and converting each to uppercase.
4. It constructs `new_data` as a list containing `title` (the header row) and `column_data` (a single list of uppercase strings).
5. It calls write_csv(new_data, "read_test_process.csv"), which writes these two rows to the new file and returns 1 on success.
6. Therefore, process_csv_data returns 1.
