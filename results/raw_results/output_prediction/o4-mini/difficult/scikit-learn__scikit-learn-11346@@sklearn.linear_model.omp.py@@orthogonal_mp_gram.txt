We call orthogonal_mp_gram with Gram (12×12), Xy shape (12×1), n_nonzero_coefs=1, tol=None.

1. In orthogonal_mp_gram, it prepares Gram and Xy arrays, sets return_path=False so coef is zeros (12×1), and will collect one solution for the single column.

2. It calls _gram_omp(Gram, Xy[:,0], n_nonzero_coefs=1, tol_0=None, tol=None).

3. Inside _gram_omp:
   - alpha = Xy vector of length 12.
   - max_features = n_nonzero_coefs = 1, so we will pick exactly one atom.
   - On first iteration, lam = argmax |alpha| = index 4 (value  2.15579371).
   - n_active=0, so it sets L[0,0]=sqrt(Gram[4,4])=1.
   - Swaps row 0↔4 and col 0↔4 in Gram, and swaps indices[0]↔indices[4], and swaps Xy[0]↔Xy[4].
   - Increments n_active to 1.
   - Solves (L Lᵀ) γ = Xy[:1], but L=1 so γ = Xy[0] after swap = original Xy[4] = 2.15579371.
   - Because n_active==max_features, it breaks and returns (γ, idx, n_iter) = ([2.15579371], [4], 1).

4. Back in orthogonal_mp_gram, it places γ into coef at row idx=4, col 0. All other entries remain zero.

5. Finally it squeezes coef to a length-12 array and returns it.

Thus the output is a vector of length 12 with zero everywhere except index 4 = 2.15579371.
