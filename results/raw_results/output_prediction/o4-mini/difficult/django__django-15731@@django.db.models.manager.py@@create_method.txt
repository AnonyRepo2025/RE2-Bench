[THOUGHT]
1. We call create_method with name="values_list" and method={} (a dict object).
2. Inside create_method, we use @wraps(method) to decorate the inner function. The wraps decorator sets the inner functionâ€™s __wrapped__ attribute to the original method object.
3. The returned object is the inner function (manager_method), which now has a __wrapped__ attribute pointing to the original method (the dict {}).
4. According to the requested output structure, we expose only the __wrapped__ attribute, which is {}.

    "__wrapped__": {}
