[THOUGHT]
1. We call `_eval_product(self={}, term="2**(2*\"f(k)\")", limits=["1"])`.
2. Inside `_eval_product`, the very first unpacking is  
     k, a, n = limits  
   but `limits` is a list of length 1, not length 3.
3. Python will immediately raise a `ValueError` when trying to unpack three variables from a one-element list.
4. The error message is:  
     ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 1)
