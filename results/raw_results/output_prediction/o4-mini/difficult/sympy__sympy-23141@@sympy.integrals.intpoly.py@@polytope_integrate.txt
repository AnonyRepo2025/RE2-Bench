[THOUGHT]
1. We call polytope_integrate(poly={}, expr="x**2 + x*y + y**2").
2. clockwise is False by default.
3. First branch checks isinstance(poly, Polygon) â†’ False since poly is a dict.
4. Next branch: `elif len(poly[0]) == 2:` attempts to evaluate `poly[0]`. Since `poly` is an empty dict, this raises a KeyError for key `0`.
5. There is no except block catching this, so the KeyError propagates out of the function.
6. Therefore, the call does not return a normal value but instead raises `KeyError: 0`.
