[THOUGHT]
We are calling Expr.__eq__ with  
  self = some Expr‐derived instance (details irrelevant, only that it is not a Number)  
  other = "picoweber"  

Step by step:  
1. In __eq__, first  
     other = _sympify("picoweber")  
   This parses the string into a SymPy Symbol('picoweber'), which is an Expr.  
2. isinstance(other, Expr) is True, so we proceed.  
3. Check  
     if not (self.is_Number and other.is_Number) and type(self) != type(other):  
   Since neither self nor other is a Number, the left clause (self.is_Number and other.is_Number) is False, so `not False` is True.  
   Also type(self) ≠ type(other) (self is some Expr subclass, other is Symbol), so the whole `if` condition is True, and we immediately return False.  

Therefore __eq__ returns False.
