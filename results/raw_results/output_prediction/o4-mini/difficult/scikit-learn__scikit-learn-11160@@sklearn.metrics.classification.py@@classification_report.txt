[THOUGHT]
1. The JSON “y_true” and “y_pred” fields are both Python strings (not lists or arrays).  
2. classification_report immediately calls _check_targets, which calls type_of_target(y_true).  
3. In type_of_target, it checks  
     valid = (isinstance(y_true, Sequence) or ...) and not isinstance(y_true, string_types).  
   But y_true is a string, so isinstance(y_true, Sequence) is True, yet isinstance(y_true, string_types) is also True, so valid = True and False = False.  
4. Thus type_of_target immediately raises  
     ValueError("Expected array-like (array or non-string sequence), got %r" % y_true)  
5. classification_report does not catch this, so the call fails with that ValueError.

Therefore the output is that ValueError is raised with the given message.
