[THOUGHT]
We call unparse(node). The input node has fields “elts”: null and “ctx”: {}, matching the structure of an ast.Tuple with no elements.

Step through unparse:
1. node is not None, not a str, not an operator node, not any of the earlier AST types.
2. We eventually reach the check for ast.Tuple:
   ```
   elif isinstance(node, ast.Tuple):
       if node.elts:
           return ', '.join(unparse(e) for e in node.elts)
       else:
           return '()'
   ```
3. Here node.elts is null (i.e. None), which is falsey, so we take the else branch and return `'()'`.

Thus the output is the string "()".
