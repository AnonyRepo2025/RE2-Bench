1. We call `_expand_partial_derivative(self)` on a `PartialDerivative`‐instance whose internal `args` tuple (i.e. `self.args`) must at least contain the original expression and any variables.  Even though the prompt’s “input” doesn’t spell out `self.args`, in the actual method the first thing that happens is

    args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)

   with   
   • `expr = self.expr = self.args[0]`  
   • `variables = self.variables = self.args[1:]`  

2. In the simplest case where there are no dummy index contractions (no tensor indices at all),  
   • `_contract_indices_for_derivative` calls `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices([expr], replace_indices=True)`.  
   • Since `expr` is not a tensor‐indexed object, `get_indices(expr) == ()`.  
   • `_indices_to_free_dum` on `[()]` yields  
       – `indices = []`  
       – `free = []`  
       – `dummy_data = []`  
   • Thus  
       – `args` (returned) = `[expr]`  
       – `indices = []`  
       – `free = []`  
       – `dum = []`  

3. Back in `_expand_partial_derivative` we then do

       obj = self.func(*args)

   which is essentially `PartialDerivative(expr)` again (with no variables).  Immediately after we set

       obj._indices = []  
       obj._free    = []  
       obj._dum     = []

   These are the requested output attributes.  

4. Nothing else in the method further mutates them before returning `result` (which in this simple no‐tensor case is `obj` itself).

Therefore the resulting object has

    _indices = []
    _free    = []
    _dum     = []
