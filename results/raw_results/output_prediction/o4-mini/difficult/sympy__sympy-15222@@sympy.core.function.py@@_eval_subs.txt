[THOUGHT]
We are calling Basic._subs(self, old, new).  

1. Check  `if _aresame(self, old)`:  
   - `self` is an object with `nargs = {}`,  
   - `old` is a different object (with lots of extra kwargs, module, doc, assumptions, etc.).  
   - They are not the same, so `_aresame(self, old)` is False, we do not return `new`.  

2. Compute `rv = self._eval_subs(old, new)`.  
   - For a generic Basic, `_eval_subs` is not overridden (or returns None), so `rv` is None.  

3. Since `rv is None`, we enter the `fallback(self, old, new)`:  
   - It does `args = list(self.args)`.  No `.args` were given in the input, so we assume `self.args` is empty, `args = []`.  
   - The loop over `args` does nothing, so `hit` remains False.  
   - Because `hit` is False, `fallback` returns `self` unchanged.  

Thus `_subs` returns `self`.  Since `self` was represented as `{"nargs": {}}` in the input, that is our output.
