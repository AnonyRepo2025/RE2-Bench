1. get_integer_part is called with expr = 1/2 (a Sympy Rational), no = -1, options = {}, return_ints = True.  
2. It first calls evalf(expr, prec=30, options={}), which converts 1/2 to an mpf 0.5 with accuracy = 30 bits; so ire = mpf(0.5), iim = None, ire_acc = 30.  
3. Since only a real part exists, it computes gap = fastlog(0.5) − 30 ≈ (−1) − 30 = −31, which is < −margin (−10), so it does not re-evaluate at higher precision.  
4. It then calls calc_part on the real part:
   - nint = int(to_int(mpf(0.5))) = 0.  
   - The mpf exponent p ≠ 0, so it's not already an integer.  
   - It computes x = evalf(expr, prec=10) → mpf(0.5), then check_target passes.  
   - mpf_cmp(x, 0) = 1, which is not equal to no (−1), so nint remains 0.  
   - from_int(0) yields 0, and it returns (nint, INF) for the real part.  
5. There is no imaginary part, so im = 0 by fallback.  
6. Since return_ints = True, it returns the Python ints (0, 0).  
7. Therefore the output is the tuple (0, 0), represented in JSON as [0, 0].
