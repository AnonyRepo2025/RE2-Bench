[THOUGHT]
1. Call `map` with `data = []`.
2. The first check `if type(data) != list and type(data) != tuple` passes because `data` is a list.
3. Next, `if len(data) == 0` is true since the list is empty.
4. Therefore, the function immediately returns the tuple `(0.0, [0.0])` without further processing.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [0.0, [0.0]]
}
