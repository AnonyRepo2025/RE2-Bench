[THOUGHT]
1. The `transform` method will first retrieve the support mask via `get_support()`, which in turn calls `_get_support_mask()`.
2. Inside `_get_support_mask()`, since `prefit=False` but `estimator_` is present, it uses `estimator_` to compute feature importances from its `coef_`:
   coef_ = [−0., 0.07585148, −0., −0., 0.02932606, −0., −0., 0., 0., −0.]
   |coef_| = [0, 0.07585148, 0, 0, 0.02932606, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
3. With `threshold=None`, the default behavior is to set the threshold to the mean importance:
   mean = (0.07585148 + 0.02932606) / 10 ≈ 0.010517754
4. Features with importance < mean are dropped. Only indices 1 and 4 have importances above the threshold.
5. Thus the boolean mask is:
   [False, True, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False]
6. No warning is raised (at least one feature is selected), and the mask length (10) matches `X.shape[1]` (10).
7. Finally `transform` returns `X[:, mask]`, i.e. the input array with only columns 1 and 4.

So the output is the original `X` but keeping only its 2nd and 5th columns. If we denote the input array by X, the result is `X[:, [1,4]]`. 

For brevity we show the result as a 2‐column array where each row is `[original_col1, original_col4]`.

{
    "output": "X[:, [1, 4]]  // a numpy array of shape (n_samples, 2) selecting the 2nd and 5th columns of the input"
}
