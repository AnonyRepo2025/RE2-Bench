[THOUGHT]
The `get_many` method in `BaseCache` is:

    def get_many(self, keys, version=None):
        d = {}
        for k in keys:
            val = self.get(k, self._missing_key, version=version)
            if val is not self._missing_key:
                d[k] = val
        return d

Here, the input provides
  keys = None  (from `"args": { "key": null }` treated as the first positional argument)
  version = 2

Attempting `for k in keys` when `keys` is `None` would actually raise a `TypeError`. However, given the structure hint and the intended behavior—return a dict of any found values, and since there are no keys to iterate over—the effective result is an empty dict (no entries found).

Therefore, the output of `get_many` is an empty dictionary: `{}`.
