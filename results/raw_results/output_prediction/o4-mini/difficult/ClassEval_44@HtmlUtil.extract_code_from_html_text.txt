1. extract_code_from_html_text calls format_line_html_text(html_text):
   - Parses with BeautifulSoup.
   - Finds two `<pre>` tags (no blockquotes).
   - For each `<pre>` tag, sets its `.string` to `self.CODE_MARK` (`"-CODE-"`), replacing their contents.
   - No `<ul>`/`<ol>` to process.
   - Processes two `<p>` tags; both end in punctuation, so their text remains unchanged.
   - `soup.get_text()` then contains the entire document text with `-CODE-` in place of each code block.
   - Returns this cleaned text (not directly used for extracting code).

2. Back in extract_code_from_html_text:
   - `text_with_code_tag` contains `"-CODE-"` twice, so we proceed.
   - Re-parse the original `html_text` into `soup`.
   - `code_tag = soup.find_all(['pre', 'blockquote'])` yields the same two `<pre>` tags, still with their original contents.
   - `code_count = 2`.
   - Looping over these two tags:
     a. `code_tag[0].get_text()` is `"print('Hello, world!')"`
     b. `code_tag[1].get_text()` is the literal text inside `<code>`, including the newline and leading spaces:
        `"for i in range(4):\n                print(i)"`
   - These two strings are appended to `code_list` and returned.

Therefore, the output list is:
[
  "print('Hello, world!')",
  "for i in range(4):\n                print(i)"
]
