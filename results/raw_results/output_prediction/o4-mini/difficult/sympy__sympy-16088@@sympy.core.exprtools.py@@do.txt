[THOUGHT]
1. The input string is sympified to the expression:  
   -(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)

2. In `do`, we hit the `p.is_Add` branch with  
   terms = [-(root),  I*sqrt(3)*root]  
   where root = (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3).

3. We check if each term’s coefficient is divisible by -1:
   - For -(root): coeff = -1 → divisible.
   - For  I*sqrt(3)*root: coeff = 1  → divisible by -1 (1 = (-1)*(-1)).
   Thus we factor out a -1 from both terms, flipping signs:
   list_args → [ root,  -I*sqrt(3)*root ],  cont → -1.

4. We call `gcd_terms` on `root + (-I*sqrt(3)*root)`, which factors out the common `root`:
   p → root*(1 - I*sqrt(3)).

5. Finally, `_keep_coeff` multiplies back the accumulated `cont = -1`:
   -1 * ( root*(1 - I*sqrt(3)) ) = root*(I*sqrt(3) - 1).

6. The result is printed in canonical form as  
   (I*sqrt(3) - 1)*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
