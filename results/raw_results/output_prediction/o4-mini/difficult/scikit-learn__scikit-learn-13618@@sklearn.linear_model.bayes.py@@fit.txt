[THOUGHT]
Simulating 300 iterations of BayesianRidge on a 50×5 dataset with full SVD updates and computing the final coefficients, noise and weight precision, and the full posterior covariance matrix by hand is not feasible. The method returns the estimator instance itself with its attributes updated. In particular:

- The hyperparameters (`n_iter`, `tol`, `alpha_1`, etc.) remain as given.
- `X_offset_` is set to the column‐wise means of X.
- `X_scale_` is an array of ones (since `normalize=False`).
- `scores_` remains an empty list (`compute_score=False`).
- `n_iter_` is the actual number of iterations run (≤300).
- `alpha_`, `lambda_` are the final noise and weight‐precision estimates.
- `coef_` is the 5-element coefficient vector.
- `sigma_` is the 5×5 posterior covariance matrix of the weights.
- `intercept_` is set so that predictions have the correct offset.

Without executing the code numerically, we cannot supply the exact floating‐point values for these attributes. Nonetheless, the output of `fit` is simply the estimator itself, represented here by its updated `__dict__`.
