[THOUGHT]
1. y_pred and y_true are treated as 1D numeric arrays: y_pred = [0., 1.], y_true = [0., 1.].  
2. check_array casts y_pred to float64, ensure_2d=False leaves it shape (2,).  
3. eps='auto' → eps = np.finfo(float64).eps ≈ 2.220446049250313e-16.  
4. LabelBinarizer on y_true = [0,1] gives classes_ = [0,1] and transformed_labels = [[1,0],[0,1]].  
5. Clip y_pred to [eps, 1–eps] → [eps, 1–eps].  
6. y_pred is 1D → reshape to (2,1) and then expanded to 2 columns:  
     [[1–eps, eps], [eps, 1–eps]].  
7. Verify sums to 1; normalize leaves it unchanged.  
8. Per-sample loss = –∑ labelᵢ·log(pᵢ) =  
     sample 0: –(1·log(1–eps)+0·log(eps)) = –log(1–eps) ≈ eps  
     sample 1: –(0·log(eps)+1·log(1–eps)) = –log(1–eps) ≈ eps  
9. Average loss = (eps + eps)/2 = eps ≈ 2.220446049250313e-16.
