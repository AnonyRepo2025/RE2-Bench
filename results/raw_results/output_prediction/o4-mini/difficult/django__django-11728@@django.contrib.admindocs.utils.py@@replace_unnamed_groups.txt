[THOUGHT]
1. The input pattern is "^a/?$".  
2. unnamed_group_matcher = re.compile('\('), so we look for literal '(' in the pattern. There are none.  
3. Therefore unnamed_group_indices = [].  
4. Since there are no unnamed groups, group_indices and group_start_end_indices remain empty.  
5. The function returns the original pattern unchanged.  
6. Hence the output is "^a/?$".
