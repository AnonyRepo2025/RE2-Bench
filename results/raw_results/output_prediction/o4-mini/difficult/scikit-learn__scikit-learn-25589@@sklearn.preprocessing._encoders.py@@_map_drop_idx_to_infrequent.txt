[THOUGHT]
We call OneHotEncoder._map_drop_idx_to_infrequent with feature_idx=2 and drop_idx="1".
Inside the method:
1. It checks `if not self._infrequent_enabled`. Here `self._infrequent_enabled` is False.
2. Because infrequent is not enabled, it immediately returns the original `drop_idx` unchanged.
Thus the output is the string "1".
