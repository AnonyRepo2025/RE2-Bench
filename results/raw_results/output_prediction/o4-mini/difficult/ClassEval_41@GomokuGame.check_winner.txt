[THOUGHT]
1. The method iterates over each cell.  
2. At row 0, col 0 the cell contains "O".  
3. It tries each direction; for direction (0,1) (horizontal to the right):  
   - i=1 → (0,1) contains "O"  
   - i=2 → (0,2) contains "O"  
   - i=3 → (0,3) contains "O"  
   - i=4 → (0,4) contains "O"  
   After checking 4 steps, count reaches 5, so `_check_five_in_a_row` returns True.  
4. Since a five-in-a-row of "O" is found, `check_winner` returns "O" immediately without checking further.

    "output": "O"
