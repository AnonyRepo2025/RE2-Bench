[THOUGHT]
1. We call periodicity(f, symbol, check=False) with f = csc(2*x) - sec(x) and symbol = x.
2. orig_f = f; then f = simplify(orig_f). simplify does not change the form here, so f stays csc(2*x) - sec(x).
3. f.free_symbols contains x, so we proceed.
4. f is an Add (sum of two terms), so we go into the f.is_Add branch.
5. We split f into k + g where k is the constant part (terms independent of x) and g the x‐dependent remainder. Both csc(2*x) and sec(x) depend on x, so k = 0 and g = csc(2*x) - sec(x).
6. Since k is zero, we set period = _periodicity(g.args, x), i.e. we find a common period for the two terms.
7. Term 1: csc(2*x).  csc(u) has period 2*pi in u; here u = 2*x ⇒ the period in x is (2*pi)/2 = π.
8. Term 2: sec(x).  sec(u) has period 2*pi in u ⇒ period in x is 2*pi.
9. The period of a sum is the least common multiple of the individual periods: lcm(π, 2π) = 2π.
10. No further checks requested, so periodicity returns 2*pi.
