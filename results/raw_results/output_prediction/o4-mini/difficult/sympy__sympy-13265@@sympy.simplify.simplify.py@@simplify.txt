[THOUGHT]
1. The call is simplify(expr="50").
2. First, expr = sympify("50") turns the string "50" into the Sympy Integer 50.
3. The code then tries to do `return expr._eval_simplify(...)`. Integer does not implement a specialized `_eval_simplify`, so this raises an AttributeError (or effectively does nothing), and control falls through.
4. The rest of the simplify routine ultimately leaves a simple integer unchanged.
5. Therefore, the function returns the Sympy Integer 50, which serializes to the JSON number 50.
