[THOUGHT]
1. The first branch `if other is self.physical_unit` does an identity check. Although `other` represents the same meter unit, it is not the same object as `self._physical_unit`, so this is False.  
2. We set `other_function_unit = getattr(other, 'function_unit', other)`. `other` has no `function_unit` attribute, so `other_function_unit` is just the meter unit.  
3. We then check `if self.function_unit.is_equivalent(other_function_unit)`. Here `self.function_unit` is a function‐unit (scale = –2, no dimensions) and `other_function_unit` is a length unit (meter). They are not dimensionally equivalent, so this is False.  
4. We fall into the `else` block and execute:
      return self.physical_unit.to(other,
                                   self.to_physical(value),
                                   equivalencies)
   - `self.to_physical(value)` would convert the function‐quantity into its physical representation; since `value` is 2.5 in the same physical unit, this yields 2.5.  
   - Then `self.physical_unit.to(other, 2.5, equivalencies)` is just converting meters to meters, which leaves 2.5 unchanged.  
5. Thus the final returned result is the numeric 2.5.
