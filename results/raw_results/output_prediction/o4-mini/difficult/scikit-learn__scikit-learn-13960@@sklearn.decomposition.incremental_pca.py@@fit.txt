[THOUGHT]
When we call fit(self, X, y=None), the very first thing done to X is:

    X = check_array(X, accept_sparse=[…], copy=self.copy, dtype=[np.float64, np.float32])

In the JSON input, X is given as a single Python string containing the textual representation of the 100×3 array, not as an actual list-of-lists or NumPy array.  Thus, in check_array, NumPy will attempt:

    np.asarray(X, dtype=np.float64)

i.e. to convert the entire string into a floating-point scalar.  Since the string begins with “[[-3.1748…”, this conversion fails, raising a ValueError along the lines of

    ValueError: could not convert string to float:  
    ‘[[-3.17480141e-01  6.92062330e-01 … 9.81036610e-01]]’

Because no exception handling is present in fit, this error propagates out of fit immediately.  Therefore, fit does not return a “self” object with updated attributes; instead it raises that ValueError.
