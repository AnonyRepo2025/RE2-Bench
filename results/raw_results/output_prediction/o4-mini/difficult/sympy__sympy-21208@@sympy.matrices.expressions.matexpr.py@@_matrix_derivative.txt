[THOUGHT]
We call `_matrix_derivative(expr, x)` with a 2×2 “matrix” object whose internal `_mat` is `None`.  Step by step:

1.  lines = `expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)`.  
    - That returns a single `_LeftRightArgs` holding `left=[1,1]` and `higher = expr._eval_derivative(x)`.

2.  To get `higher`, we do `expr._eval_derivative(x)` → `expr.applyfunc(lambda y: y.diff(x))`.  
    - Inside `applyfunc` we try to build a list `[f(y) for y in expr]`, but iteration over `expr` looks at its `_mat` sequence.  
    - Since `expr._mat` is `None`, we get:
        TypeError: `'NoneType' object is not iterable`

Because of that, the function never reaches the rank-computation or the `Add.fromiter` branch—it crashes immediately in the attempt to iterate the missing `_mat` list.  Hence no valid return value is produced, but rather a Python exception.
