[THOUGHT]
We call generate_primes with self.n = 15.

1. Since 15 ≥ 2, proceed.
2. Initialize a boolean sieve of length 16 (indices 0 to 15), mark sieve[0] and sieve[1] as False, others True.
3. p = 2. Since 2*2 = 4 ≤ 15 and sieve[2] is True, mark multiples of 2 from 4 up to 15:
   - Mark 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 as False.
4. Increment p to 3. Since 3*3 = 9 ≤ 15 and sieve[3] is True, mark multiples of 3 from 9 up to 15:
   - Mark 9, 12 (already False), 15 as False.
5. Increment p to 4. Now 4*4 = 16 > 15, exit the loop.
6. Collect all indices i from 2 to 15 where sieve[i] is True:
   - These are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.
7. Return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13].
