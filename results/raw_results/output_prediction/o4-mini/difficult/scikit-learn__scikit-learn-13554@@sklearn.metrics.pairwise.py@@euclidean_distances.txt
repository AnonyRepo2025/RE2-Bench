We compute euclidean_distances(X, Y, squared=True) step by step.

1. check_pairwise_arrays converts the Python lists X and Y into 2-D numpy arrays of shape (1,4).

2. Since X.dtype is float64 (not float32) and X_norm_squared is None:
   XX = row_norms(X, squared=True)[:, np.newaxis]
   = [[sum(x_i²)]]
   = [[0.56804456² + 0.92559664² + 0.07103606² + 0.0871293²]]
   ≈ [[1.19204137]]

3. Similarly Y.dtype is float64 and Y_norm_squared is None:
   YY = row_norms(Y, squared=True)[np.newaxis, :]
   = [[0.96366276² + 0.38344152² + 0.79172504² + 0.52889492²]]
   ≈ [[1.98223179]]

4. Compute the dot‐product matrix X·Yᵀ (shape (1,1)):
   D = sum_i X[0,i] * Y[0,i]
     = 0.56804456·0.96366276 + … + 0.0871293·0.52889492
     ≈ 1.00447885

5. Form distances:
   distances = -2·D
             = -2.0089577
   distances += XX
             = -2.0089577 + 1.19204137
             = -0.81691633
   distances += YY
             = -0.81691633 + 1.98223179
             = 1.16531546

6. np.maximum(...,0) leaves it unchanged (positive), and since squared=True we return this squared distance.

Thus the result is a (1×1) array with the single value ≈1.16531546.
