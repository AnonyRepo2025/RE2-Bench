[THOUGHT]
1. The function `exptrigsimp` is written to operate on Sympy `Basic` expressions, but here we are passing in a plain Python string: `"(1 + \"exp(2)\")/(y*(-1 + \"exp(2)\"))"`.
2. The first call `newexpr = bottom_up(expr, exp_trig)` will do:
   - It tries to access `expr.args`, but since `expr` is a `str`, `expr.args` raises `AttributeError`.
   - That exception is caught inside `bottom_up`, and because `nonbasic=False`, it simply returns the original `expr` unchanged.
3. The second `bottom_up(newexpr, f)` likewise returns the same string, for the same reason.
4. Subsequent checks like `newexpr.has(HyperbolicFunction)` would also fail on a `str`, but assuming the code does not transform or raise, it ultimately returns the original `expr`.
5. Therefore, the output of `exptrigsimp` is exactly the input string, unchanged.
