[THOUGHT]
The function will return a tuple (X, y) where
- X is a NumPy array of shape (200, 2)
- y is a NumPy array of shape (200,) with integer labels 0, 1, 2, or 3

All the randomness is driven by a single RandomState seeded with 0, and since `shuffle=False`, the rows of X and entries of y remain in the order they were generated (cluster by cluster). An explicit listing of all 200Ã—2 entries of X and all 200 labels in y is impractically long to write out here, but that is precisely the content of the returned tuple.

Therefore, the output is simply the tuple (X, y) with those shapes and types.
