[THOUGHT]
1. `solve` initializes `open_list` with one element: `(initial_state, [])`.
2. It enters the loop, pops `(current_state, path)` = `(initial_state, [])`.
3. It checks `current_state == goal_state`. Since they are identical, the check passes.
4. It immediately returns the current `path`, which is an empty list `[]`.
