We need to compute confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred) with default labels=None, sample_weight=None, normalize=None.

1. _check_targets sees both y_true and y_pred are 1d integer sequences → y_type='multiclass', they pass through unchanged.

2. labels=None ⇒ labels = unique_labels(y_true, y_pred) = sorted union {0,1,2}.

3. sample_weight defaults to an array of ones of length N (the number of samples).

4. Build mapping label_to_ind = {0:0, 1:1, 2:2}.  
   y_true and y_pred only contain 0,1,2 so no “unknown” labels.

5. Both arrays filtered only to entries < n_labels=3, but here all entries are in {0,1,2}, so no filtering.

6. We must count for each true class i (rows) how many times it was predicted as j (columns):

   - True class 0: these occur in the first 40 positions of the arrays.  
     Looking at y_pred in those 40 positions:  
       • positions 0–36: all predicted 0 ⇒ 37 counts to (0,0)  
       • positions 37–39: predicted 1 ⇒  3 counts to (0,1)  
       • no predictions of 2 for true‐0.  
     So row 0 = [37, 3, 0].

   - True class 1: these occupy the next 43 positions (positions 40–82).  
     In those 43 positions y_pred has exactly 10 zeros (a block of 10 “0”s) and 33 ones (the remaining positions), with no “2”s.  
     So row 1 = [10, 33, 0].

   - True class 2: these are the final 4 positions; in y_pred they are all “2”.  
     So row 2 = [0, 0, 4].

Putting it together, the 3×3 confusion matrix is

    [[37,  3, 0],
     [10, 33, 0],
     [ 0,  0, 4]]
