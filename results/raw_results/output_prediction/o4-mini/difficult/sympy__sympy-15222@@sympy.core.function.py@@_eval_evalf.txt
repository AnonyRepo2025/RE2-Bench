[THOUGHT]
1. We call Function._eval_evalf(self, prec=2).
2. In the first try-block it does `fname = self.func.__name__`. Our `self` has no `func` attribute, so accessing `self.func` raises AttributeError.
3. This is caught by the `except (AttributeError, KeyError)` clause.
4. In that except block it tries `return Float(self._imp_(â€¦ ), prec)`. But `self` also has no `_imp_` attribute, so that raises AttributeError.
5. That second AttributeError is caught by the inner `except (AttributeError, TypeError, ValueError)`, which does a bare `return` (i.e. returns None).
6. Therefore `_eval_evalf` returns None.
