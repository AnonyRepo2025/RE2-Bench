[THOUGHT]
The provided snippet of `_setup` relies heavily on matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn internal objects that are not fully specified in the input. For example:

- `Scale` (the parent of `ContinuousBase`) is not given, so we don't know the defaults for `_tick_params` or `_label_params`.
- Methods like `new.tick()` or `new.label()` are not defined here.
- `new._get_transform()` and `new._get_scale()` depend on the `"log"` transform string but their implementations are not included.
- `PseudoAxis`, its `.major.locator()`, and `.major.formatter` logic are all undefined in the snippet.
- The `Property` type for `prop` and its `get_mapping()` method are not provided.
- Many of these return rich objects (locator, formatter, transform), not simple primitives.

Without stubbing or mocking these external dependencies, we cannot trace actual return values for:
- `_matplotlib_scale`
- `_tick_params`
- `_label_params`
- `_pipeline` (a list of callables)
- `_legend` (a tuple of locations and labels)
- `_spacer` (a function)
- the transform trees

Therefore, it is impossible to produce concrete values for the placeholders `XXX`.
