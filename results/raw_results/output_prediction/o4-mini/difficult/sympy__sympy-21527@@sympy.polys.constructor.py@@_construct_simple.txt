[THOUGHT]
We call `_construct_simple(coeffs, opt)` with coeffs = None and opt = {}.

1. Enter `_construct_simple`, initialize flags and `float_numbers = []`.
2. Next line tests `if opt.extension is True:`, but `opt` is a plain dict so accessing `opt.extension` raises an AttributeError. However, even if we assumed `opt.extension` somehow defaults to False, we would then do `for coeff in coeffs:`. Since `coeffs` is `None`, iterating over it raises a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`.

No code in `_construct_simple` catches this error, so the function will terminate with that TypeError.

Thus the call does not return a normal value but raises:
   TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
