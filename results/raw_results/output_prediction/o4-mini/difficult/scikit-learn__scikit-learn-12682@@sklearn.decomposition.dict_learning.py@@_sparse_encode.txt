1. We call `_sparse_encode` with  
   X shape = (3, 8),  
   dictionary shape = (8, 8),  
   gram shape = (8, 8),  
   cov = None, algorithm = "lasso_cd", regularization = 1.0, positive = True, etc.

2. In the code:
   - `X.ndim != 1`, so keep X as (3, 8).
   - `n_samples = 3`, `n_features = 8`, `n_components = 8`.
   - `dictionary.shape[1] == X.shape[1]` so no ValueError.
   - Since `cov is None` *and* `algorithm == 'lasso_cd'`, the branch that would compute `cov` is skipped.
   - We go into the `elif algorithm == 'lasso_cd'` branch.
     * Compute `alpha = regularization / n_features = 1.0 / 8 = 0.125`.
     * Instantiate `clf = Lasso(alpha=0.125, fit_intercept=False, normalize=False,
       precompute=gram, max_iter=1000, warm_start=True, positive=True)`.
     * Call `clf.fit(dictionary.T, X.T, check_input=False)`.  
       - Here `dictionary.T` is (8, 8) and `X.T` is (8, 3), so this fits 8 samples × 8 features to 3 targets.
       - With positive=True and α = 0.125, the coordinate‐descent Lasso with non‐negativity constraints will shrink many coefficients to zero.
     * After fitting, `clf.coef_` has shape (3, 8) (one 8‐vector of coefficients per target).
   - We set `new_code = clf.coef_`.
   - Since `new_code.ndim == 2`, we return it directly.

3. In this particular synthetic example, the combination of the random dictionary, the random data X, the non‐negativity constraint, and the relatively large penalty (α=0.125) causes *all* learned coefficients to be zero.  

Hence the output is a 3×8 matrix of zeros.
