[THOUGHT]
1. The call is nsimplify(expr="1/4 + \"sqrt(5)\"/4", constants=None).  
2. The initial `sympify(as_int(expr))` fails, so we move on to  
   `expr = sympify(expr)`, which parses to the exact SymPy expression  
   `Rational(1,4) + sqrt(5)/4`.  
3. There are no free symbols and `rational` is None, so we skip the early return.  
4. We evaluate numerically to high precision, recognize the numeric value  
   is `(1 + sqrt(5))/4`, and `mpmath.identify` recovers the exact form  
   `1/4 + sqrt(5)/4`.  
5. That becomes our real part `re`, the imaginary part is zero.  
6. Since `re == expr`, and `rational` is not `False`, we fall through  
   to `_real_to_rational(expr)`, which returns the same exact expression.  
7. The final result is therefore the SymPy expression  
   `sqrt(5)/4 + 1/4`.
