[THOUGHT]
1. We call call_command("transaction", stdout={}, no_color=True).
2. In call_command, command_name is a string, so we go into the “else” branch.
3. We do   
     app_name = get_commands()[command_name]  
   Since no Django settings have been configured, get_commands() returns only the core‐provided commands. There is no “transaction” in django.core.management.commands, so get_commands()[“transaction”] raises a KeyError.
4. That KeyError is caught immediately and wrapped as  
     raise CommandError("Unknown command: %r" % command_name)  
   i.e. CommandError("Unknown command: 'transaction'").
5. call_command does not catch CommandError, so it propagates out.

Therefore call_command does not return a normal value but raises a CommandError with the message "Unknown command: 'transaction'".
