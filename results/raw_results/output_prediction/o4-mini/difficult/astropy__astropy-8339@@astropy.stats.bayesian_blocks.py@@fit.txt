[THOUGHT]
1. The algorithm sets up edges = [t[0], midpoints…, t[-1]], so edges has length N+1 = 21.
2. With x small noise around zero and a modest penalty (p0 = 0.05), the best solution is a single block spanning the entire data → only change points at the start and end.
3. In the traceback, this yields change_points = [0, N] = [0, 20].
4. Hence the returned block edges are edges[0] and edges[20], i.e. t[0] and t[-1].
5. t[0] = 66.89240597, t[-1] = 19.09110312.
