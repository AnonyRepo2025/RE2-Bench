1. The input expr is the string "-x**3".
2. fraction starts by calling sympify(expr), so expr becomes the Sympy expression -x**3 (which is internally Mul(-1, x**3)).
3. It initializes numer = [] and denom = [].
4. It iterates over the factors of expr via Mul.make_args; since expr is a Mul, this yields the tuple (-1, x**3).
5. First term is Integer(-1):
   - term.is_commutative is True, but term.is_Pow is False and term.func is not exp.
   - term.is_Rational is True, so we do n, d = term.as_numer_denom() â†’ n = -1, d = 1.
   - Append: numer = [-1], denom = [1].
6. Second term is x**3:
   - term.is_commutative is True and term.is_Pow is True.
   - term.as_base_exp() gives (b, ex) = (x, 3). ex.is_negative is False, ex.is_positive is True.
   - So we append the entire term to numer: numer = [-1, x**3].
7. Loop ends. exact=False, so return (Mul(*numer), Mul(*denom)) which is (Mul(-1, x**3), Mul(1)).
   - Mul(-1, x**3) simplifies to -x**3, and Mul(1) is 1.
8. Therefore the function returns the tuple (-x**3, 1).

We represent this as a JSON array of the string forms of the two components.
