[THOUGHT]
1. We are in Set._complement(self, other), with other a FiniteSet whose `_elements` is frozenset({10, 15}).  
2. The code for the FiniteSet‐case does:

    from sympy.utilities.iterables import sift  
    def ternary_sift(el):  
        contains = self.contains(el)  
        return contains if contains in [True, False] else None  
    sifted = sift(other, ternary_sift)  

   Since `self.contains(10)` and `self.contains(15)` both return neither True nor False (i.e. unknown), both 10 and 15 go into `sifted[None]`.  
   Hence  
     sifted[False] == []  
     sifted[None]  == [10, 15]  

3. The code then builds  
     FiniteSet(*sifted[False])         →  FiniteSet()  (an empty set)  
   and  
     Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False)  
   and returns their Union.  

4. The returned Union has as its first argument the empty FiniteSet, whose internal `_elements` is an empty frozenset.  

5. The STRUCTURE asks only for the `_elements` field of that FiniteSet, which is `frozenset()`.
