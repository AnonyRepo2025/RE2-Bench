[THOUGHT]
We interpret the input `expr` as the SymPy expression

    exp(-I*pi*a/2) * besseli(a, 2*sqrt(x)) * exp_polar(I*pi/2)

and follow the code in `besselsimp`.

1. `orig_expr` is this same Mul of three factors.
2. The first two `.replace` calls attempt to rewrite `besselj` and `besseli` when their second argument contains one of the “ifactors” (`I`, `exp_polar(±I*pi/2)`), but here the argument of `besseli` is `2*sqrt(x)`, whose Mul-args are `[2, sqrt(x)]`. No match ⇒ `besseli` remains unchanged.
3. The next two `.replace` calls attempt a “minus‐factor” rewrite when the second argument contains `-1` or `exp_polar(I*pi)`, again no match ⇒ still unchanged.
4. The final `.replace` with `expander` only rewrites half‐integer or integer orders; here the order is the symbol `a`, so it does nothing.
5. Since after all replaces `expr == orig_expr`, the code skips the final `.factor()` and simply returns the original Mul.

Hence the output is exactly the same expression we started with.

Filling the structure, we put that one string into the list under `nargs._elements`.
