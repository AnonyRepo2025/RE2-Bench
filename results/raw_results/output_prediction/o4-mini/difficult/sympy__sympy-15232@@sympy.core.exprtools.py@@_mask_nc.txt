[THOUGHT]
1. The input `eq` is the Sympy expression x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n.  
2. In `_mask_nc`, the first check is `if expr.is_commutative:`. Since x, n, m, o are all commutative symbols, the entire expression is commutative.  
3. Therefore the function immediately returns `(eq, {}, [])`.  
4. We represent that tuple as a JSON array for the output.
