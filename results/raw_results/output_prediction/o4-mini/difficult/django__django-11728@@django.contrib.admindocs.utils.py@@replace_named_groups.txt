[THOUGHT]
1. The function compiles `named_group_matcher` looking for substrings like `(?P<name>)`.  
2. Given pattern `"admin/password_change/done/"`, there are no parentheses at all, so no named groups to replace.  
3. `named_group_indices` is empty, so `group_pattern_and_name` stays empty and no replacements occur.  
4. The original pattern is returned unchanged.
