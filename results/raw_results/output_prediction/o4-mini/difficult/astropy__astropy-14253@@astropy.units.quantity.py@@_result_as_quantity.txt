[THOUGHT]
1. The `result` is a float (11.5), not a tuple or list, so the first `if` is skipped.
2. `out` is `None`, so we enter the `if out is None` branch.
3. Since `unit` is not `None`, the method returns `self._new_view(result, unit, finalize=False)`.
4. The `_new_view` call produces a new `Quantity` whose `_unit` attribute is exactly the passed `unit` object, with no modifications.
5. The requested output structure only exposes the returned object's `_unit` fields, which will match the input `unit` fields.
