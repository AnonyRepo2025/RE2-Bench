[THOUGHT]
1. The function is called with `text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"` and a non-empty `chars = "0123456789-"`.
2. Since `chars` is truthy, it does `text = text.rstrip(chars)`, which strips any trailing characters found in the set `{'0','1',â€¦,'9','-'}`.
3. The original text ends with the characters `"2.2"`. Starting from the end:
   - The last character `'2'` is in `chars`, so it is removed.
   - The next character `'.'` is not in `chars`, so stripping stops.
4. The resulting `text` is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
5. Since this is not the empty string, the function returns that result.
