[THOUGHT]
We have self.employees = {"1": {...}} (key is the string "1"). The method receives employee_id = 2 (an integer). The check `if employee_id in self.employees:` will test if integer 2 is equal to any string key in the dict. Since `"1"` != `2`, the condition is False. Therefore the method returns False, and no deletion occurs.
