[THOUGHT]
1. The function call is f("urecord", 8).
2. Compute s.ljust(8, '='):
   - "urecord" has length 7, target length is 8, so one '=' is appended.
   - Result: "urecord=".
3. Call rpartition('=') on "urecord=":
   - This splits into ("urecord", "=", "") at the last '='.
4. Taking index [0] yields "urecord".
5. Therefore, the function returns "urecord".
