[THOUGHT]
1. The function `f` checks if `target` ("**") is in the list `items`.
2. The list `items` is ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]. The element "**" is present.
3. It returns `items.index("**")`, which is the index of the first occurrence of "**" in the list.
4. Enumerating: 0 -> "1", 1 -> "+", 2 -> "-", 3 -> "**". Thus the index is 3.
5. The function returns 3.
