[THOUGHT]
We call set_city on the WeatherSystem instance:

1. The method signature is def set_city(self, city).
2. Inside, it does self.city = city.
3. No return statement is present, so Python returns None by default.
4. Thus after calling set_city, the new self.city would be "Beijing", but the methodâ€™s return value is None, which in JSON becomes null.
