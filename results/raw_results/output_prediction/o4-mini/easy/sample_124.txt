[THOUGHT]
We have txt = "i like you", sep = " ", sep_count = -1.

1. Initialize o = ''.
2. The while condition is `sep_count > 0 and txt.count(sep) > 0`. Here sep_count = -1, so sep_count > 0 is False.
3. Since the while loop is never entered, o remains '' and txt remains "i like you".
4. The function returns o + txt, which is "" + "i like you" = "i like you".
