[THOUGHT]
1. Initial text = "\"Leap and the net will appear" (first character is a double quote), res = 123, so str(res) = "123".
2. Loop over c in ['*', '\n', '"']:
   - For c='*': no '*' in text → unchanged.
   - For c='\n': no newline in text → unchanged.
   - For c='"': replace all '"' with '!' + "123" = "!123". The leading '"' is replaced, so text becomes "!123Leap and the net will appear".
3. Check if text.startswith('!') → True. Then we do text = text[len(str(res)):] = text[3:].
   - text before slicing: "!123Leap and the net will appear"
   - Slicing from index 3 removes the characters at indices 0,1,2 ('!', '1', '2'), so new text = "3Leap and the net will appear".
4. Return "3Leap and the net will appear".
