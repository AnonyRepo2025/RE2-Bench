[THOUGHT]
The `write_excel` method:
1. Creates a new `Workbook` via `openpyxl.Workbook()`.
2. Gets the active sheet.
3. Iterates over each row in `data` (4 rows) and calls `sheet.append(row)`. All entries are valid (strings or integers), so no errors.
4. Calls `workbook.save(file_name)` with `"test_data_process.xlsx"`. Assuming the path is writable, this succeeds.
5. Calls `workbook.close()`.
6. Returns 1 in the `try` block since no exception occurred.
Therefore, the output is 1.
