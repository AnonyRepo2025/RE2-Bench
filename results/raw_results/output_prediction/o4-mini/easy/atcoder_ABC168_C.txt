The input line is: 797 797 0 0  
So a = 797, b = 797, h = 0, m = 0.

Compute the angles:
theta_h = 2.5π − 2π * ((0 + 0/60) / 12) = 2.5π  
theta_m = 2.5π − 2π * (0 / 60) = 2.5π  

Thus both hands lie at the same angle 2.5π.  
Coordinates:
x_h = 797 * cos(2.5π),  y_h = 797 * sin(2.5π)  
x_m = 797 * cos(2.5π),  y_m = 797 * sin(2.5π)  

Since a = b and the angles are identical, (x_h, y_h) == (x_m, y_m).  
Distance = sqrt((x_h − x_m)² + (y_h − y_m)²) = 0.
