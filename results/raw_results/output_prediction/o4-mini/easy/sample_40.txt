[THOUGHT]
1. The input text is "the cow goes moo".
2. Compute its length: len("the cow goes moo") = 16.
3. The code calls text.ljust(len(text) + 1, '#'), so the target width is 16 + 1 = 17.
4. text.ljust(17, '#') pads the original string on the right with '#' characters until its total length is 17.
5. Since the original string is length 16, exactly one '#' is added.
6. The returned value is "the cow goes moo#".
