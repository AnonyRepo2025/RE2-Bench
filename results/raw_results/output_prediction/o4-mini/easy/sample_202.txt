[THOUGHT]
1. The function is called with array = [2, 15, 15, 1] and list = [15, 1].
2. array.extend(list) mutates array to [2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1].
3. The list comprehension `[e for e in array if e % 2 == 0]` produces [2] but its result is not assigned or used, so array remains [2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1].
4. The return statement `[e for e in array if e >= 10]` filters for elements â‰¥ 10, yielding [15, 15, 15].
