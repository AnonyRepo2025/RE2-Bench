[THOUGHT]
We need to apply text.lstrip(froms) then text.rstrip(froms).  
froms = "st 0\t\n  " → set of characters {'s','t',' ','0','\t','\n'}.  
Initial text = "0 t 1cos ".  

1. Left strip:
   - '0' is in froms → remove
   - next ' ' is in froms → remove
   - next 't' is in froms → remove
   - next ' ' is in froms → remove
   - next '1' not in froms → stop  
  Result after lstrip: "1cos "

2. Right strip:
   - trailing ' ' is in froms → remove
   - now trailing 's' is in froms → remove
   - now trailing 'o' not in froms → stop  
  Result after rstrip: "1co"

So the function returns "1co".
