[THOUGHT]
1. The method splits the encoded string on the first ‘$’, yielding:
   algorithm = "argon2"
   rest = "argon2id$v=19$m=102400,t=2,p=8$Y041dExhNkljRUUy$TMa6A8fPJhCAUXRhJXCXdw"
2. It asserts that algorithm == self.algorithm (“argon2”), which passes.
3. It calls self._load_library(), which imports the “argon2” module successfully.
4. It then invokes argon2.PasswordHasher().verify("$" + rest, password).
5. The Argon2 library parses the embedded parameters (argon2id, v=19, m=102400, t=2, p=8), the salt, and the hash, and checks them against the supplied password "secret".
6. Since the encoded hash was generated for "secret" with those parameters, verify() returns True (no VerificationError is raised).
