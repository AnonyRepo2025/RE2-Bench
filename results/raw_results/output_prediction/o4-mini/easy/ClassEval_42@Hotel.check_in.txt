[THOUGHT]
1. The method checks if room_type ("single") is in self.booked_rooms keys. booked_rooms = {"single": {}}, so "single" is present — we do not return False here.
2. Next it checks if name ("guest 1") is in self.booked_rooms["single"]. That dict is empty, so the condition is False — we skip the inner block entirely.
3. There is no return statement after these checks, so the function returns None by default.
