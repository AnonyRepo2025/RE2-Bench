[THOUGHT]
We start with nums = [5, 3, 3, 7].
The loop is: for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1).  len(nums) = 4, so range(4 - 2, -1, -1) = range(2, -1, -1) yields i = 2, 1, 0 in that order.

1. i = 2:
   nums[2] = 3. 3 % 2 != 0 (it's odd), so we do not remove anything.
   nums remains [5, 3, 3, 7].

2. i = 1:
   nums[1] = 3. 3 % 2 != 0 (odd), so no removal.
   nums remains [5, 3, 3, 7].

3. i = 0:
   nums[0] = 5. 5 % 2 != 0 (odd), so no removal.
   nums remains [5, 3, 3, 7].

No even numbers were found at any of these indices, so the list is never modified. The function returns the original list [5, 3, 3, 7].
