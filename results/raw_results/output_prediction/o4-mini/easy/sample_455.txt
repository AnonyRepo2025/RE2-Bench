[THOUGHT]
1. The function initializes `uppers = 0`.
2. It iterates over each character in the input text `"?XyZ"`:
   - '?' → `isupper()` is False → `uppers` remains 0
   - 'X' → `isupper()` is True  → `uppers` becomes 1
   - 'y' → `isupper()` is False → `uppers` remains 1
   - 'Z' → `isupper()` is True  → `uppers` becomes 2
3. After the loop, `uppers = 2`. The code checks `uppers >= 10`, which is `2 >= 10` → False.
4. Since the condition is False, the function returns the original text unchanged: `"?XyZ"`.
