[THOUGHT]
1. The function receives student_marks = {"882afmfp": 56} and name = "6f53p".  
2. It checks if "6f53p" is a key in the student_marks dictionary.  
3. Since "6f53p" is not present in {"882afmfp": 56}, the condition fails.  
4. The function then executes the `return 'Name unknown'` branch.  
5. Hence, the output is the string "Name unknown".
