[THOUGHT]
1. Initialize `result` as an empty string.
2. The input `text` is "was,", which has length 4.
3. Loop `i` from 3 down to 0:
   - i=3: `text[3]` is ',' → `result` becomes ",".
   - i=2: `text[2]` is 's' → `result` becomes ",s".
   - i=1: `text[1]` is 'a' → `result` becomes ",sa".
   - i=0: `text[0]` is 'w' → `result` becomes ",saw".
4. Return `result`, which is ",saw".
