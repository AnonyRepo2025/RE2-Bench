[THOUGHT]
The constructor receives `data = "[1 2 3 4]"`. In Python this is a single string, so `np.array(data)` produces a 0-dimensional NumPy array with that entire string. Then `get_variance` calls `np.var` on an array of dtype `<U9>` (string), which cannot be converted to numbers. This will raise a TypeError such as:
  “ufunc 'subtract' not supported for the input types…”
Therefore, `get_variance` does not return a numeric result but instead raises an exception.
