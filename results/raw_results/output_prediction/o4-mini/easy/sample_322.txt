[THOUGHT]
1. Initial chemicals list: ["lsi", "s", "t", "t", "d"], num = 0  
2. fish = chemicals[1:] → fish = ["s", "t", "t", "d"]  
3. chemicals.reverse() → chemicals becomes ["d", "t", "t", "s", "lsi"]  
4. The for-loop is for i in range(num), but num = 0, so the loop body does not execute and fish remains ["s", "t", "t", "d"].  
5. chemicals.reverse() again → chemicals returns to ["lsi", "s", "t", "t", "d"]  
6. The function returns chemicals, which is ["lsi", "s", "t", "t", "d"].
