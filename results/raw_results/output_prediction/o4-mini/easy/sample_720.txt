[THOUGHT]
1. Initial `items` is ["bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf", "n"], and `item` is "n".
2. Enter the `while` loop: `items[-1]` is "n", which equals `item`, so we pop it.
   - After `pop()`, `items` becomes ["bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf"].
3. Check the `while` condition again: now `items[-1]` is "bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf", which does not equal "n", so exit the loop.
4. Append `item` ("n") to `items`, yielding ["bfreratrrbdbzagbretaredtroefcoiqrrneaosf", "n"].
5. Return the length of `items`, which is 2.
