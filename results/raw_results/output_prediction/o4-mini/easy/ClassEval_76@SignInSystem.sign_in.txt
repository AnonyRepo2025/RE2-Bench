[THOUGHT]
We have an instance where self.users = {"user1": True}. We call sign_in("user1").

Method sign_in:
1. Check if "user1" not in self.users. Since "user1" is a key in self.users, this condition is False.
2. Go to the else branch: set self.users["user1"] = True (already True, but reassigned) and return True.

Thus the method returns True.
