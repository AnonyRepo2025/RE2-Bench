[THOUGHT]
1. The function `add(lst)` computes `sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0])`.
2. The input list is [4, 4, 6, 8].
3. `range(1, len(lst), 2)` with `len(lst)=4` yields indices 1 and 3.
4. At i=1: `lst[1]` is 4, which is even, so include 4.
5. At i=3: `lst[3]` is 8, which is even, so include 8.
6. The list comprehension produces [4, 8].
7. Summing these gives 4 + 8 = 12.
8. The function returns 12.
