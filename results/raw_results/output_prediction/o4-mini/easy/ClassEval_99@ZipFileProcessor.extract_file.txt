[THOUGHT]
1. A `ZipFileProcessor` is instantiated with `file_name = "example.zip"`.
2. Calling `extract_file("example5.txt", "output_directory")` will:
   a. Try to open `"example.zip"` in read mode using `zipfile.ZipFile`.
   b. Attempt to extract the member `"example5.txt"` into `"output_directory"`.
3. If `"example.zip"` does not exist or does not contain `"example5.txt"`, `zipfile.ZipFile` or `zip_file.extract` will raise an exception.
4. The `except` block catches any exception and returns `False`.
5. We have no information that the ZIP file exists or contains the requested file, so we assume extraction fails and the method returns `False`.
