[THOUGHT]
1. The function `f` takes two parameters: `num` and `name`.
2. The input provides `num = 23` and `name = "Cornareti"`.
3. Inside the function, `f_str` is the template string `'quiz leader = {}, count = {}'`.
4. The `format` method is called with `name` as the first argument and `num` as the second.
5. The first `{}` is replaced by `"Cornareti"`, and the second `{}` is replaced by `23`.
6. The resulting string is `"quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23"`.
7. This string is returned.
