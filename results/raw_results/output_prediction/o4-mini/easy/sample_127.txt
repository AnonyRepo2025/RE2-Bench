[THOUGHT]
1. The function f takes a string `text`.
2. It calls `text.splitlines()`. This splits the string at line boundaries (by `\n`) and returns a list of lines without the newline characters.
3. Given the input text `"145\n\n12fjkjg"`, there are two `\n` in a row:
   - Before the first `\n` is `"145"`.
   - Between the two `\n` is an empty string `""` (an empty line).
   - After the second `\n` is `"12fjkjg"`.
4. Therefore, `text.splitlines()` produces the list `["145", "", "12fjkjg"]`.
5. The function returns the length of this list, which is `3`.
