[THOUGHT]
The `read_file_as_json` method will attempt to open `"test_2.txt"`.  
Since no such file content was provided and assuming the file does not exist in the environment, Python will raise a FileNotFoundError when trying to open it.  
Therefore, the function does not return a JSON‚Äêparsed object but instead propagates the FileNotFoundError exception.
