[THOUGHT]
The existing `employees` dict has a key `"1"` (a string), but `employee_id` is the integer `1`. The `in` check looks for an integer key `1`, which is not present among the string keys. Therefore the condition `if employee_id in self.employees` is false, so the method adds a new entry with key `1` and returns `True`.
