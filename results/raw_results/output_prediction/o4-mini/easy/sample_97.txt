[THOUGHT]
1. The function `f` is called with `lst = []`.
2. The first line `lst.clear()` clears the list, but it is already empty, so `lst` remains `[]`.
3. The `for i in lst:` loop will not execute at all because `lst` is empty.
4. Since the loop completes without encountering a `return False`, the `else` clause of the loop is executed, which returns `True`.
5. Therefore, `f([])` returns `True`.
