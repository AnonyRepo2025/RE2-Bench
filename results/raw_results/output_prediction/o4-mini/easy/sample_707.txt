[THOUGHT]
1. The input text is "undbs l", so length = 7 characters.
2. Compute index = position % (length + 1) = 1 % 8 = 1.
3. Neither position nor index is negative, so index remains 1.
4. Convert text to list: ['u','n','d','b','s',' ','l'].
5. Pop the element at index 1, which is 'n'. The list becomes ['u','d','b','s',' ','l'].
6. Join the list back into a string: "udbs l".
