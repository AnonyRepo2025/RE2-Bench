[THOUGHT]
1. The function f takes arr1 and arr2.
2. It does new_arr = arr1.copy(), so new_arr starts as [5, 1, 3, 7, 8].
3. It then does new_arr.extend(arr2), which appends each element of arr2 in order:
   - Append "" → [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, ""]
   - Append 0  → [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0]
   - Append -1 → [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1]
   - Append [] → [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]
4. The function returns [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []].
