[THOUGHT]
The method has no explicit return, so it will return None by default.
1. The `inventory` dict has a key `"1"` (string), but `product_id` is provided as the integer `1`.
2. The `if product_id in self.inventory` check fails because `1` (int) â‰  `"1"` (str).
3. The body is not executed, and with no return statement, Python returns `None`.
