[THOUGHT]
The function f(s) iterates over each character in the string s and at the first decimal character it returns:
  index i + 1 if that character is '0', otherwise i + 0.
Given s = "11":
1. i = 0, s[0] = '1'
   - s[0].isdecimal() is True (since '1' is a decimal digit)
   - s[0] == '0' is False
   - So the function returns 0 + 0 = 0
The loop exits immediately with return value 0.
