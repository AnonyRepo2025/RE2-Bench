[THOUGHT]
We call f with text = "00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110".

1. field = text.replace(' ', '')  
   Removes all spaces, so field becomes "0000000000000000011011000110010101101110".

2. g = text.replace('0', ' ')  
   Replaces every '0' with a space, leaving '1's and original spaces. (We don’t need the exact value of g for the return.)

3. text = text.replace('1', 'i')  
   In the original text, each '1' becomes 'i'; '0's and spaces stay the same.  
   - "00000000" → "00000000"  
   - " " → " "  
   - "00000000" → "00000000"  
   - " " → " "  
   - "01101100" → "0ii0ii00"  
   - " " → " "  
   - "01100101" → "0ii00i0i"  
   - " " → " "  
   - "01101110" → "0ii0iii0"  

   So the returned text is "00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0i 0ii0iii0".

Hence, f returns that string.
