[THOUGHT]
1. The function `f` is called with `text="mathematics"` and `suffix="example"`.
2. `suffix` is non-empty, so the condition `if suffix and text.endswith(suffix):` is evaluated.
3. `"mathematics".endswith("example")` is False.
4. Since the condition is False, the function returns the original `text` unchanged.
5. The returned value is `"mathematics"`.
