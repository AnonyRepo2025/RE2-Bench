[THOUGHT]
1. The initial list `nums` is [1, 3, 3].
2. The `for i in range(len(nums))` uses the length of `nums` at the start, which is 3, so `i` will take values 0, 1, 2.
3. i = 0: nums[0] = 1, 1 % 3 != 0 → no append. List stays [1, 3, 3].
4. i = 1: nums[1] = 3, 3 % 3 == 0 → append 3. List becomes [1, 3, 3, 3].
5. i = 2: nums[2] = 3, 3 % 3 == 0 → append 3. List becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3].
6. The loop ends (it does not see the newly appended elements for further iterations).
7. The function returns [1, 3, 3, 3, 3].
