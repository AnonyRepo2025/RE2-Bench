[THOUGHT]
1. The program reads a line from input and converts it to an integer n. Here n = 10.
2. It initializes i = 1 and j = n * n = 100.
3. It enters a loop `while i < j:` and on each iteration:
   - Prints the current values of i and j separated by a space.
   - Increments i by 1 and decrements j by 1.
4. This continues until i is no longer less than j. The last iteration is when i = 50 and j = 51 (since after printing "50 51", i becomes 51 and j becomes 50, breaking the loop).
5. Therefore, it prints 50 lines pairing (1,100), (2,99), â€¦, up to (50,51).

The exact stdout is the numbers "1 100" through "50 51", each on its own line. In JSON output we represent newlines with `\n`.
