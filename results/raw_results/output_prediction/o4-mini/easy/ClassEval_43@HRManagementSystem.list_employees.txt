[THOUGHT]
We call list_employees on an HRManagementSystem whose employees dict contains a single entry with key "1" and associated info.

1. Initialize employee_data = {}.
2. Since self.employees is non-empty, enter the loop.
3. For employee_id = "1", employee_info = {"name": "John", "position": "Manager", "department": "Sales", "salary": 100000}.
4. Create employee_details = {}.
5. Set employee_details["employee_ID"] = "1".
6. Loop over employee_info items:
   - key="name", value="John" → employee_details["name"] = "John"
   - key="position", value="Manager" → employee_details["position"] = "Manager"
   - key="department", value="Sales" → employee_details["department"] = "Sales"
   - key="salary", value=100000 → employee_details["salary"] = 100000
7. Assign employee_data["1"] = employee_details.
8. Return employee_data, which is:
   {
     "1": {
       "employee_ID": "1",
       "name": "John",
       "position": "Manager",
       "department": "Sales",
       "salary": 100000
     }
   }
