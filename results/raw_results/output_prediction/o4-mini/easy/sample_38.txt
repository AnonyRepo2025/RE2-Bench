[THOUGHT]
The function f does two things:
1. Calls `string.title()`, which title-cases the string by uppercasing the first cased character after any non-cased character (digits, punctuation, spaces) and lowercasing the rest.
2. Calls `.replace(' ', '')` to remove all spaces.

Input string: "1oE-err bzz-bmm"

Step-by-step for `.title()`:
- Characters and boundaries:
  0: '1' (non-cased) → stays '1'
  1: 'o' (cased, after non-cased '1') → uppercase → 'O'
  2: 'E' (cased, inside word) → lowercase → 'e'
  3: '-' (non-cased) → stays '-'
  4: 'e' (cased, after non-cased '-') → uppercase → 'E'
  5: 'r' → lowercase → 'r'
  6: 'r' → lowercase → 'r'
  7: ' ' (space, non-cased) → stays ' '
  8: 'b' (cased, after space) → uppercase → 'B'
  9: 'z' → lowercase → 'z'
 10: 'z' → lowercase → 'z'
 11: '-' → stays '-'
 12: 'b' (after '-') → uppercase → 'B'
 13: 'm' → lowercase → 'm'
 14: 'm' → lowercase → 'm'

So `string.title()` → "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm"

Then `.replace(' ', '')` removes the space:
→ "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"
