[THOUGHT]
We call `_validate_phoneNumber` with phoneNumber = "jgdjrj".

1. Check `if not phoneNumber`:  
   "jgdjrj" is a non-empty string, so this is False.

2. Check `if len(phoneNumber) != 11 or not phoneNumber.isdigit()`:  
   - `len("jgdjrj")` is 6, which is not 11 â†’ this condition is True.  
   - Also, `"jgdjrj".isdigit()` is False because it contains letters.  

Since the `or` condition is satisfied, the method returns `None`.
