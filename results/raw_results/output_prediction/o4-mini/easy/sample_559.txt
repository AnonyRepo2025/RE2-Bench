[THOUGHT]
1. The input argument n is the string "first-second-third".
2. The function casts n to str, so n remains "first-second-third".
3. n[0] is the first character: "f".
4. n[1:] is the substring from the second character onward: "irst-second-third".
5. We call .replace('-', '_') on "irst-second-third", yielding "irst_second_third".
6. The function returns n[0] + "." + the replaced substring, i.e. "f" + "." + "irst_second_third" = "f.irst_second_third".
