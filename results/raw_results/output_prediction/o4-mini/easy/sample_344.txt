[THOUGHT]
1. The original list passed in is [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].
2. Inside f:
   - new_list = list[:] creates a copy: [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].
   - new_list.sort() sorts it in place → [2, 4, 6, 8, 15].
   - operation(new_list) calls the lambda x: x.reverse(), which reverses new_list in place → [15, 8, 6, 4, 2].
3. The lambda returns None, but f ignores that and returns the original list argument, which was never modified.
4. Therefore f(...) returns [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].
