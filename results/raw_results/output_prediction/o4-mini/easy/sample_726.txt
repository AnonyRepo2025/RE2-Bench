[THOUGHT]
We call f on the string "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds".

1. Initialize ws = 0.
2. Iterate over each character in the text, increment ws whenever s.isspace() is True.
3. The text has spaces at positions:
   - between "jcle" and "oq" (one space)
   - between "oq" and "wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds" (one space)
   No other whitespace characters occur.
   So ws = 2.
4. len(text) is the total number of characters:
   We counted indices 0 through 33 inclusive, giving length 34.
5. The function returns the tuple (2, 34).

Representing this in JSON, we'll use an array for the tuple.
