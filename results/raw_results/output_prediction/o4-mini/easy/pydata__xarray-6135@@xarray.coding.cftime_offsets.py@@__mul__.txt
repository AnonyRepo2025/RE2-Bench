[THOUGHT]
1. We call QuarterOffset.__mul__(self, other) with self.n = 1 and other = 2.5.  
2. The method checks `isinstance(other, float)`. Since 2.5 is a float, this condition is True.  
3. Because of that, the method returns the special Python value `NotImplemented`.  
4. No other computation is performed.
