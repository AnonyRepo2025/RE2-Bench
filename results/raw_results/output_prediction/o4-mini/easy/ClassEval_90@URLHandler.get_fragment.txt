[THOUGHT]
1. The method get_fragment is called on URLHandler with url = "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#aaa".
2. fragment_start = self.url.find('#')  
   The '#' character appears just before "aaa", so fragment_start is the index of that '#'.
3. Since fragment_start is not -1, return self.url[fragment_start + 1:], i.e., the substring after the '#' character.
4. That substring is "aaa".

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "aaa"
}
