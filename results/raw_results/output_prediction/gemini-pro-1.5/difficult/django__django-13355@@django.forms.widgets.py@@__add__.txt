Inside the `__add__` function:

1. A new `Media` object named `combined` is created.
2. `combined._css_lists` is initialized as a copy of `self._css_lists`, which is `[]`.
3. `combined._js_lists` is initialized as a copy of `self._js_lists`, which is `[]`.
4. The code iterates through `other._css_lists`. Since `other._css_lists` is `[]`, the loop does not execute.
5. The code iterates through `other._js_lists`. Since `other._js_lists` is `[]`, the loop does not execute.
6. The function returns the `combined` object.
