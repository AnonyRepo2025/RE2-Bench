1. **Input Processing:** The input `X`, `dictionary`, and `gram` are strings. They are converted to NumPy arrays.
2. **Algorithm Selection:** The `algorithm` parameter is "lasso_cd".
3. **Regularization:** `regularization` is 1.0.  `alpha` is calculated as `regularization / n_features = 1.0 / 8 = 0.125`.
4. **Lasso with Coordinate Descent:** A Lasso object is created with `alpha=0.125`, `fit_intercept=False`, `normalize=False`, `precompute=gram`, `max_iter=1000`, `warm_start=True`, and `positive=True`.
5. **Model Fitting:** The Lasso model is fitted to the data using `dictionary.T` as the design matrix and `X.T` as the target.
6. **Output:** The function returns the fitted coefficients (`clf.coef_`), which is a 2D NumPy array.
