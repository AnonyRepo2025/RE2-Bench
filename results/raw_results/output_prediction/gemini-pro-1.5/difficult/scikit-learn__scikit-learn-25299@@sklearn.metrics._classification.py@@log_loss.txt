1. **y_pred processing:** `y_pred` is converted to a NumPy array. `eps` is set to the smallest representable value for the data type of `y_pred`.
2. **Label Binarizer:** A `LabelBinarizer` is fitted on `y_true`. `y_true` is binarized. Since `y_true` has only two unique values, the binarized version will have two columns.
3. **y_pred clipping and reshaping:** `y_pred` is clipped to the range [eps, 1-eps]. It's reshaped to a 2D array if necessary. Since `y_pred` has only one column initially, another column is added such that each row sums to 1.
4. **Checks and warnings:** The code checks if the number of classes in `y_true` and `y_pred` match. It also checks if rows in `y_pred` sum to 1 (or close to 1).
5. **Loss calculation:** The log loss is calculated using the formula and summed.
6. **Return:** The weighted sum of the loss is returned. Since `sample_weight` is None and `normalize` is True, the function returns the average loss.

`y_true` is `[0, 1]` and `y_pred` is `[0, 1]`.
- `LabelBinarizer` transforms `y_true` to `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.
- `y_pred` becomes `[[1-eps, eps], [eps, 1-eps]]`.
- `loss = -xlogy(transformed_labels, y_pred).sum(axis=1)` calculates the log loss for each sample.
- The function returns the average loss.
