Let's trace the execution of `_eval_evalf` with the given input.

1. **`self.func` and `self.args`:**
   - `self.func` will resolve to the class of `self`, which is `Function`.
   - `self.args` will be a tuple containing the arguments passed to the function, which in this case is `(1,)`.

2. **`mpmath` function lookup:**
   - The code tries to find a function with the same name as `self.func.__name__` (which is "Function") in the `mpmath` library. It won't find it.
   - It then checks `MPMATH_TRANSLATIONS` for a translation, but "Function" is not a key in that dictionary.

3. **Fallback to `_imp_`:**
   - Since the `mpmath` function isn't found, the code enters the `except` block and attempts to call `self._imp_`. However, `Function` doesn't define an `_imp_` method, so this will raise an `AttributeError`.

4. **Second `except` block:**
   - The `AttributeError` is caught, and the code returns `None`.

Therefore, the final output will be `None`.
