The `move` method takes the current state and a direction, and returns the new state after the move.

1. **Find the blank:** The `find_blank` method is called with the given state. The blank (0) is located at `state[1][2]`. So, `i=1` and `j=2`.

2. **Create a copy:** A copy of the state is created using `new_state = [row[:] for row in state]`.

3. **Move left:** The direction is 'left'. The code swaps the blank with the element to its left: `new_state[i][j], new_state[i][j - 1] = (new_state[i][j - 1], new_state[i][j])`.
   - `new_state[1][2]` (0) and `new_state[1][1]` (8) are swapped.

4. **Return new state:** The modified `new_state` is returned.

Therefore, the new state will be:

```
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [7, 0, 8],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
```
