1. The `transform` method of `OneHotEncoder` is called with `X` equal to `[['55555'], ['22']]`.
2. Inside `transform`, `_transform` is called. This method encodes the input `X` into integer codes and handles unknown values based on the `handle_unknown` attribute. Since `handle_unknown` is 'infrequent_if_exist', unknown categories are treated as infrequent if infrequent categories exist.
3. `_transform` returns `X_int` and `X_mask`.
4. `_map_infrequent_categories` is called next. Since `_infrequent_enabled` is false, this method does nothing.
5. The code then creates a sparse matrix from `X_int` and `X_mask`.
6. Since `sparse_output` is true, the function returns a sparse matrix.

`X` has shape (2, 1).
`self.categories_` is computed during the `fit` method, which is not called in this example. Let's assume the `fit` method has been called and `self.categories_` is equal to `[array(['22', '55555'], dtype=object)]`.
`self._n_features_outs` will be equal to `[2]`.
`X_int` will be equal to `[[1], [0]]`.
`X_mask` will be equal to `[[ True], [ True]]`.
`indices` will be equal to `[1, 0]`.
`indptr` will be equal to `[0, 1, 2]`.
`data` will be equal to `[1. 1.]`.
