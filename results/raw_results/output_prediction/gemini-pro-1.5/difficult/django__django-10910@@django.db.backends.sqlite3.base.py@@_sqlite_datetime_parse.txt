1. The function `_sqlite_datetime_parse` receives `dt` as "2016-06-13 00:00:00", `tzname` as "UTC", and `conn_tzname` as "UTC".

2. `backend_utils.typecast_timestamp("2016-06-13 00:00:00")` is called. Inside `typecast_timestamp`:
   - `s` is "2016-06-13 00:00:00".
   - `d` becomes "2016-06-13" and `t` becomes "00:00:00".
   - `dates` becomes `["2016", "06", "13"]`.
   - `times` becomes `["00", "00", "00"]`.
   - `seconds` is "00", `microseconds` is "0".
   - Assuming `settings.USE_TZ` is True, `tzinfo` is `utc`.
   - The function returns `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)`.

3. Back in `_sqlite_datetime_parse`, `dt` is now `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)`.

4. The `if conn_tzname:` block is executed. Since `conn_tzname` is "UTC", `dt` remains unchanged as it's already in UTC.

5. The `if tzname is not None and tzname != conn_tzname:` block is skipped because `tzname` and `conn_tzname` are both "UTC".

6. The function returns the final `dt` value.
