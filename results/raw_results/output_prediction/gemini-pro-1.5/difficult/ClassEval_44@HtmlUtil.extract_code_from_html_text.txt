Let's trace the execution of `extract_code_from_html_text` with the given input.

1. **`format_line_html_text(html_text)` is called:**
   - The HTML is parsed.
   - Code tags (`pre`, `blockquote`) are found and their content is replaced with `-CODE-`.
   - `<p>` tags' content is modified to end with a period or a colon (if followed by a code block).
   - The modified HTML text is returned after entity decoding and line feed formatting.

2. **Inside `extract_code_from_html_text`:**
   - `text_with_code_tag` now contains the modified text with `-CODE-` markers.
   - The code checks if `-CODE-` is present. It is.
   - The original HTML is parsed again.
   - Code tags (`pre`, `blockquote`) are found.
   - The loop iterates twice (two code blocks).
   - In the first iteration, the text inside the first `pre` tag (`print('Hello, world!')`) is extracted and added to `code_list`.
   - In the second iteration, the text inside the second `pre` tag with the `code` tag inside it (`for i in range(4):\n                print(i)`) is extracted and added to `code_list`.

3. **The function returns `code_list`:**
   - `code_list` contains the extracted code snippets.

Therefore, the output will be a list containing the two code snippets.
