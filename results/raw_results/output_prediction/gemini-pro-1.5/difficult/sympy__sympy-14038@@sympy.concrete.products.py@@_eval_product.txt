Here's how `_eval_product` will execute with the given input:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `term` is parsed as `2**(2*f(k))`, where `f(k)` is a symbolic function of `k`.
   - `limits` is a list containing only one element, `1`. This means the product has only a single value to consider, which is when k=1.

2. **Code Path:**
   - The code first checks if `k` is present in `term.free_symbols`. In our case, `k` is present within the function `f(k)`, so this condition is met.
   - The code then checks if `a == n`. However, since `limits` only has one element, `a` and `n` are not defined. The code proceeds to the next condition.
   - The code checks if `term` has `KroneckerDelta` and `_has_simple_delta(term, limits[0])`. Since `term` doesn't involve `KroneckerDelta`, this condition is false.
   - The code then calculates `dif = n - a`. Since `a` and `n` are not defined, this will raise an error.

3. **Predicted Output:**

Since the code will raise an error when trying to access `n` and `a` from the incomplete `limits`, the function will not return a value.  Therefore, the output will be an error.
