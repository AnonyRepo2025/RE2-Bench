Let's trace the execution with input `32`.

1. **Input:** `x = 32`

2. **factorization(32):**
   - The function finds the prime factorization of 32.
   - The loop runs from 2 to 5.
   - `i = 2`:
     - `32 % 2 == 0` is true.
     - The inner loop continues as long as `temp` is divisible by 2.
     - `temp` becomes 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.
     - `cnt` becomes 5.
     - `arr.append([2, 5])`
   - Since `temp` is 1, the loop terminates.
   - The function returns `[[2, 5]]`.

3. **l = sorted(l):**
   - `l` remains `[[2, 5]]`.

4. **Loop and Calculation:**
   - The outer loop iterates once (from 0 to 0).
   - `l[0][0]` is 2, which is not 1.
   - `num = 5`
   - The inner loop calculates the sum of consecutive integers until it equals or exceeds `num`.
   - `j = 1`: `s = 1`
   - `j = 2`: `s = 1 + 2 = 3`
   - `j = 3`: `s = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
   - Since `s > num`, `j` is decremented to 2.
   - `ans += j`, so `ans = 2`.

5. **Output:** The code prints the value of `ans`, which is 2.
