Here's how `_osborne` processes the given input:

1. **Input Processing:** The function receives `e = 2*sinh(2)` and `d` is not provided, so it defaults to 1.

2. **bottom_up function:** The `bottom_up` function traverses the expression tree from the leaves up.

3. **f(rv) function:**
   - The `f(rv)` function is the core logic. It checks if the current node `rv` is a hyperbolic function.
   - In our case, `rv` will be `sinh(2)`.
   - `a = rv.args[0]` extracts the argument of `sinh`, which is `2`.
   - `a = a * d` multiplies `a` by `d` (which is 1), so `a` remains `2`.
   - Since `rv.func` is `sinh`, the function returns `I * sin(a)`, which is `I * sin(2)`.

4. **Multiplication:** The `bottom_up` function replaces `sinh(2)` with `I * sin(2)` in the original expression.  The expression becomes `2 * (I * sin(2))`, which simplifies to `2*I*sin(2)`.
