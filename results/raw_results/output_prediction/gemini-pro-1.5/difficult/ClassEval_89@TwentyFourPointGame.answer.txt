Here's how the `answer` function execution flows with the given input:

1. **Input Check:** The input expression is "1+1+1+2".

2. **Statistic Calculation:** The code iterates through the expression to count the occurrences of each digit. The `statistic` dictionary becomes:
   ```
   {'1': 3, '2': 1}
   ```

3. **Number Usage Check:**
   - It creates a copy of `statistic` called `nums_used`.
   - It iterates through `self.nums` (which is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`).
   - For the first three '1's in `self.nums`, it decrements the corresponding count in `nums_used`.  `nums_used` becomes `{'1': 0, '2': 1}`.
   - For the last '1' in `self.nums`, it finds that `nums_used['1']` is 0. The condition `nums_used.get(str(num), -100) != -100 and nums_used[str(num)] > 0` becomes false.
   - It returns `False`.

Therefore, the final output is `False` because the expression uses a '2' which is not in the available numbers.
