Let's trace the execution of the `simple_tag` method and the inner `dec` function.

1. **`simple_tag` is called:**
   - `func` is provided as a callable argument.
   - The code enters the `elif callable(func):` block.
   - `return dec(func)` is executed, calling the inner `dec` function with the provided `func`.

2. **Inside `dec(func)`:**
   - `getfullargspec` is called on `unwrap(func)`. This inspects the function signature of `func`.
   - `function_name` is assigned the name of the function, which is "func".
   - A new function `compile_func` is defined.
   - `self.tag(function_name, compile_func)` registers the `compile_func` as a template tag.
   - Finally, the original `func` is returned.

Therefore, the output of `dec` is the original `func` that was passed in.
