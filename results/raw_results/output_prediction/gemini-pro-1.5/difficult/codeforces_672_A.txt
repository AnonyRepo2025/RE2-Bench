Let's trace the execution of the code with the given input 423.

The code constructs a list `li` by iterating from 1 to 370.

1. **i from 1 to 9:** `li` becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
2. **i from 10 to 99:** The code appends the reversed digits of `i` to `li`. For example, when i=10, it appends 1 and then 0. So, `li` becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 1, 1, ..., 9, 9].
3. **i from 100 to 370:** Similarly, the reversed digits of `i` are appended to `li`. For example, for i=100, 1, 0, and 0 are appended.

After the loop, `li.pop()` is called twice, removing the last two elements.  Since the loop goes up to 370, the last elements added would be 3, 7, and 0. So, the two pops remove 0 and 7.

The input `n` is 423. The code prints `li[n-1]`, which is `li[422]`.

To determine the value at index 422, let's analyze the length of `li` at different stages:

- **1-digit numbers:** 9 elements
- **2-digit numbers:** 90 numbers * 2 digits/number = 180 elements
- **3-digit numbers:** 271 numbers * 3 digits/number = 813 elements

The total number of elements before the pops is 9 + 180 + 813 = 1002. After two pops, it becomes 1000.

Now, let's find the 422nd element.

- First 9 elements are 1-digit numbers.
- Next 180 elements are from 2-digit numbers.
- The remaining elements are from 3-digit numbers.

422 - 9 = 413.  413 > 180, so the element is within the 3-digit numbers.

413 - 180 = 233.

Since each 3-digit number contributes 3 elements, we need to find which 3-digit number's digits contain the 233rd position.

233 // 3 = 77 with a remainder of 2.

So, the 77th 3-digit number (starting from 100) is 100 + 77 = 177.

The remainder is 2, which means the second digit of 177.  The digits are 1, 7, 7. The second digit is 7.

Therefore, `li[422]` is 7.
