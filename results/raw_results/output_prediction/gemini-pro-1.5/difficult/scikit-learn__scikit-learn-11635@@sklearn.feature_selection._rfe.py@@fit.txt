1. The input X and y are converted to numpy arrays. Note that `force_all_finite=False` in `check_X_y`, so `nan` and `inf` values in X are not converted to finite values.
2. `cv` becomes an instance of `StratifiedKFold` with `n_splits=5`.
3. `scorer` becomes `_passthrough_scorer` because `scoring` is None and the estimator has a `score` method (assumed based on the structure).
4. `step` is 1.
5. The code calculates `scores` by splitting the data using `StratifiedKFold`, fitting and scoring the estimator on each fold. The exact values of `scores` depend on the estimator's behavior with `nan` and `inf` values, which is not defined in the provided code. Let's assume the estimator handles these values gracefully and returns some numerical scores.
6. `argmax_idx` is calculated based on `scores`. Let's assume `argmax_idx` is 0 for simplicity.
7. `n_features_to_select` is calculated as `max(4 - 0 * 1, 1) = 4`.
8. A new `RFE` instance is created with `n_features_to_select=4`.
9. The new `RFE` instance is fitted on X and y. Let's assume `support_` is `[ True  True  True  True]`, `n_features_` is 4, and `ranking_` is `[1 1 1 1]`.
10. `self.estimator_` is cloned from the original estimator and fitted on the transformed X (all features selected) and y. Let's assume the fitted estimator has `coef_` equal to `[[1. 2. 3. 4.]]`.
11. `grid_scores_` are calculated by dividing the reversed `scores` by the number of splits (5). The exact values depend on the assumed `scores`. Let's assume `scores` is `[10 20 30 40]` for simplicity. Then `grid_scores_` will be `[8. 6. 4. 2.]`.
