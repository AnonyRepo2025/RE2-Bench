Here's how `powdenest` executes with the given input:

1. **Initial setup:**
   - `eq` is set to `_x` (a symbol).
   - `force` is `False`.
   - `polar` is `False`.

2. **`powdenest` execution:**
   - Since `force` is `False`, the first `if` block is skipped.
   - Since `polar` is `False`, the second `if` block is skipped.
   - `new = powsimp(sympify(eq))` is executed.  `sympify("_x")` converts the string "_x" into a SymPy symbol. `powsimp` simplifies powers, but in this case, there's nothing to simplify. So, `new` becomes `_x`.
   - `new.xreplace(Transform(_denest_pow, filter=lambda m: m.is_Pow or isinstance(m, exp)))` is executed.  The `xreplace` looks for powers or exponentials to transform using `_denest_pow`. However, `_x` is not a power or exponential, so the transform is not applied.  Therefore, the final result is just `_x`.
