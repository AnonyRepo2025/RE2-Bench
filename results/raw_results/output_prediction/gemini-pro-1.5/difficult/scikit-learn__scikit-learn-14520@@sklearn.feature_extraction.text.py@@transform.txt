1. The `transform` method first checks if the vectorizer is fitted by calling `check_is_fitted`. Since `vocabulary_` exists, the check passes.
2. It then calls `super().transform(raw_documents)`, which is `CountVectorizer.transform`.
3. Inside `CountVectorizer.transform`, it calls `_count_vocab` to create the count matrix.
4. Inside `_count_vocab`, since `fixed_vocab` is True, it uses the existing `vocabulary_`.
5. Since `raw_documents` is empty, the loop inside `_count_vocab` does not run.
6. The resulting sparse matrix `X` will have shape (0, 11) because there are 0 documents and 11 terms in the vocabulary.
7. The `indices`, `indptr`, and `data` attributes of the sparse matrix will be empty arrays.
8. Finally, the `transform` method returns `self._tfidf.transform(X, copy=False)`. Since `X` is empty, the result of `self._tfidf.transform(X)` will also be an empty sparse matrix with the same shape (0, 11).
