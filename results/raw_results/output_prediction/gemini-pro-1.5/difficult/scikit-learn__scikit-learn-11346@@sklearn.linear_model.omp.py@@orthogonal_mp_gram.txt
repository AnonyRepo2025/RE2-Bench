1. **Check Input Types and Shapes:**
   - `Gram` is a 12x12 matrix.
   - `Xy` is a 12x1 matrix.
   - `n_nonzero_coefs` is 1.
   - `tol` is None.
   - `norms_squared` is a list containing one element.

2. **Outer Loop (k=0):**
   - The outer loop runs only once because `Xy.shape[1]` is 1.

3. **_gram_omp Function Call:**
   - `_gram_omp` is called with the following arguments:
     - `Gram`: The 12x12 Gram matrix.
     - `Xy[:, 0]`: The first (and only) column of `Xy`.
     - `n_nonzero_coefs`: 1
     - `tol_0`: None
     - `tol`: None
     - Other arguments are default or irrelevant.

4. **Inside _gram_omp:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `indices = np.arange(12)`
     - `alpha = Xy[:, 0]`
     - `n_active = 0`
     - `max_features = 1` (because `tol` is None and `n_nonzero_coefs` is 1)

   - **Main Loop (Single Iteration):**
     - `lam = np.argmax(np.abs(alpha))`: This finds the index of the largest absolute value in `alpha` (which is `Xy[:, 0]`).  Let's assume this index is `idx_max`.
     - The code then updates `Gram`, `indices`, and `Xy` by swapping elements at `n_active` (which is 0) and `idx_max`.
     - `n_active` becomes 1.
     - `gamma` is calculated using `potrs`. This will be a single value because we are only selecting one coefficient.
     - The loop terminates because `n_active == max_features`.

5. **Return from _gram_omp:**
   - The function returns `(gamma, indices[:n_active], n_active)`.
   - `gamma` is the single coefficient value calculated.
   - `indices[:n_active]` is a 1D array containing the index `idx_max`.
   - `n_active` is 1.

6. **Back in orthogonal_mp_gram:**
   - `coef[idx, k] = x` sets the `idx_max`-th element of `coef` to `gamma`.
   - `n_iters` is updated.

7. **Final Return:**
   - The function returns `np.squeeze(coef)`, which is a 1D array of length 12, where all elements are zero except for the `idx_max`-th element, which is equal to `gamma`.

Based on the provided input, the index of the maximum absolute value in `Xy` (which is `alpha` initially) is 4 (corresponding to the value 2.15579371). Therefore, `idx_max` is 4.  The value of `gamma` will depend on the calculations within `_gram_omp`, but the structure of the output is determined.
