Here's how we determine the output of the `fit` method given the input:

1. **Initialization:** The constructor initializes the BayesianRidge object with the provided parameters. `alpha_init` and `lambda_init` are None.

2. **Preprocessing:** The `_preprocess_data` function is called. Since `fit_intercept` is True and `normalize` is False, the data is centered but not scaled. `X_offset_` will store the means of each feature, `y_offset_` will store the mean of y, and `X_scale_` will be an array of ones.

3. **Iteration:** The code then enters a loop for `n_iter` (300) times. Inside the loop:
    - `_update_coef_` calculates the coefficients and RMSE.
    - Since `compute_score` is False, the if block is skipped.
    - `gamma_`, `lambda_`, and `alpha_` are updated in each iteration.
    - The loop continues until convergence (the difference between `coef_` and `coef_old_` is less than `tol`) or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

4. **Post-Iteration:** After the loop, `n_iter_` (the actual number of iterations), `alpha_`, `lambda_`, `coef_` are updated one last time. `sigma_` is calculated. Finally, `_set_intercept` calculates the intercept.

Since `compute_score` is false, `self.scores_` will remain an empty list. The loop will run until convergence or until `n_iter` is reached.  We cannot predict the exact values of `coef_`, `alpha_`, `lambda_`, `sigma_`, `n_iter_`, and `intercept_` without actually running the code due to the iterative nature of the algorithm. However, we can determine the types and some characteristics of these variables.
