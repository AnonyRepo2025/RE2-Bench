1. The `_setup` method creates a copy of the `self` object.
2. It checks if `_tick_params` and `_label_params` are None. If so, it calls the `tick()` and `label()` methods respectively. Since `_label_params` is None, `label()` method will be called which sets `_label_params` to a dictionary with default values.
3. It calls `_get_transform()` which returns the forward and inverse transform functions based on `trans` attribute ("log" in this case).
4. It calls `_get_scale()` which returns a Matplotlib scale object based on the data name and transform functions.
5. Since `axis` is None, it creates a `PseudoAxis` object.
6. It sets default locators and formatters for the Matplotlib scale.
7. It sets `_matplotlib_scale` to the Matplotlib scale object.
8. It determines the normalization function based on `prop.normed`. Since `prop.normed` is not provided and defaults to False, `normalize`, `vmin`, and `vmax` are set to None.
9. It creates a pipeline of functions for data transformation, including unit conversion, forward transform, normalization (which is None in this case), and property mapping.
10. It defines a `spacer` function to calculate the minimum difference between unique data points.
11. Since `prop.legend` is not provided and defaults to False, the code related to legend generation is skipped.
