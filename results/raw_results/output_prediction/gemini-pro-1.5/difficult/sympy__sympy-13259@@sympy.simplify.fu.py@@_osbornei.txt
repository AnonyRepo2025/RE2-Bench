Here's how `_osbornei` processes the given input:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The input expression `e` is `2*I*tan(_Dummy_561*x)`.
   - The dummy variable `d` is implicitly `x` because it's the symbolic part of the argument of the trigonometric function.

2. **`bottom_up` traversal:**
   - The `bottom_up` function applies the function `f` to each subexpression of `e`, starting from the leaves of the expression tree.

3. **Inside `f(rv)`:**
   - **First call:** `rv` is `_Dummy_561*x`. This is not a TrigonometricFunction, so it's returned unchanged.
   - **Second call:** `rv` is `tan(_Dummy_561*x)`.
     - `const` becomes 0, and `x` becomes `_Dummy_561*x`.
     - `a` becomes `_Dummy_561*1 + 0*I = _Dummy_561`.
     - Since `rv.func` is `tan`, the function returns `tanh(_Dummy_561) / I`.

4. **Result:**
   - The expression becomes `2*I * (tanh(_Dummy_561) / I)`.
   - The `I`'s cancel out, leaving `2*tanh(_Dummy_561)`.
