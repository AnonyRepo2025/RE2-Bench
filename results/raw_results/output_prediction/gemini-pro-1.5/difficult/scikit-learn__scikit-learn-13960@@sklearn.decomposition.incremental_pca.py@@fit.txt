1. The `fit` method initializes several attributes to default values.
2. It checks the input `X` using `check_array`, which converts `X` to a NumPy array of float64.
3. It determines the `batch_size_` based on the input `batch_size` (38 in this case).
4. The code then iterates through batches of the data using `gen_batches`. Since the data has 90 samples and `batch_size_` is 38, there will be three batches: 0-37, 38-75, 76-90.
5. For each batch, `partial_fit` is called.
6. In `partial_fit`, the number of components (`n_components_`) is determined. Since `n_components` is None, it's set to the minimum of n_samples and n_features for the first batch, and then remains fixed at that value. In the first batch, n_samples=38, n_features=3. So, `n_components_` will be 3.
7. `_incremental_mean_and_var` updates the mean, variance, and sample count incrementally for each batch.
8. SVD is performed on the centered data, and the components, singular values, explained variance, etc., are updated.
9. The process repeats for all batches.

Since the calculations involve SVD and incremental updates across batches, it's difficult to compute the exact values by hand. However, we can predict the types and shapes of the outputs.
