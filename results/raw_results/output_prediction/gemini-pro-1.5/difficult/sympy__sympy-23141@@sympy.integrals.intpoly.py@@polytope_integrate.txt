1. The function `polytope_integrate` takes `poly` and `expr` as input.
2. Since `poly` is an empty dictionary, the code will go to the `else` condition of the first `if-elif-else` block.
3. Inside the `else` block, it checks if the length of `poly[0]` is 2. Since `poly` is an empty dictionary, accessing `poly[0]` will raise a `KeyError`.
