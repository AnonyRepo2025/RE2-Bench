Let's trace the execution of `_parse_scatter_color_args` with the given inputs.

1. **Initial values:**
   - c = None
   - edgecolors = "r"
   - kwargs = {}
   - xsize = 2
   - get_next_color_func = {} (We don't need the actual function for this analysis)

2. **Inside the function:**
   - `facecolors` is set to None.
   - `edgecolors` remains "r".
   - `kwcolor` is set to None.
   - The condition `kwcolor is not None and c is not None` is false.
   - The condition `kwcolor is not None` is false.
   - The condition `edgecolors is None and (not mpl.rcParams['_internal.classic_mode'])` is false because `edgecolors` is "r".
   - `c_was_none` is set to True.
   - Since `c` is None, the next line sets `c` to `get_next_color_func()`. We don't know the return value of this function, so let's assume it returns a default color, say "b".
   - `c_is_string_or_strings` becomes True because `c` is now "b".

3. **The `if not c_was_none ...` block is skipped** because `c_was_none` is True.

4. **The `if not c_is_mapped` block is entered:**
   - `colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)` is executed. Since `c` is "b", `colors` becomes the RGBA representation of "b".
   - The condition `len(colors) not in (0, 1, xsize)` is checked. Since `colors` represents a single color, its length is 1, which is in (0, 1, 2). So, no exception is raised.

5. **The function returns:**
   - `c = "b"`
   - `colors = RGBA array for "b"`. We don't need the exact value for this problem.
   - `edgecolors = "r"`
