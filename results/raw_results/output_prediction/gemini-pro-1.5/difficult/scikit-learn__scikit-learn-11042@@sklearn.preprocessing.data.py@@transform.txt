1. The `transform` method calls `_transform_selected` with `self._transform`.
2. Inside `_transform`, `X` becomes `[[4 1 1]]`.
3. `n_samples`, `n_features` are 1 and 3 respectively.
4. `indices` is `[0 2 5 9]`.
5. The condition `n_features != indices.shape[0] - 1` (3 != 3) is false, so no error is raised.
6. `mask = (X < self.n_values_).ravel()` evaluates to `[False  True  True]`, since `n_values_` is `[2 3 4]`.
7. Since `handle_unknown` is "ignore", the code proceeds.
8. `column_indices = (X + indices[:-1]).ravel()[mask]` becomes `[1 5]`, because `X + indices[:-1]` is `[[4 3 6]]`, its ravel is `[4 3 6]`, and we select elements at indices 1 and 2 (corresponding to `True` in `mask`).
9. `row_indices = np.repeat(np.arange(n_samples, dtype=np.int32), n_features)[mask]` becomes `[0 0]`.
10. `data = np.ones(np.sum(mask))` becomes `[1. 1.]`.
11. `out` is a sparse matrix constructed with these values. Its shape is (1, 9).
12. Since `n_values` is 'auto', `out = out[:, self.active_features_]` selects columns based on `active_features_ = [0 1 2 4 6 7 8]`.
13. The final `out` is a CSR matrix.
