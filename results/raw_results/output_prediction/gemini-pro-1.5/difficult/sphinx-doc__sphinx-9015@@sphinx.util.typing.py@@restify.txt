1. The function `restify` takes a class `cls` as input.
2. The input shows that `cls` has the attribute `__module__` set to "tests.test_util_typing".
3. The function checks several conditions:
    - `cls` is None: False
    - `cls` is NoneType: False
    - `cls` is Ellipsis: False
    - `cls` is in INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES: False
    - `inspect.isNewType(cls)`: This calls `isNewType` which checks if `__module__` is 'typing' and `__qualname__` is 'NewType.<locals>.new_type'. Both are false in this case, so `isNewType` returns False.
    - `isinstance(cls, types_Union)`: False, as cls is not a Union type.
    - `cls.__module__` in ('__builtin__', 'builtins'): False
    - `sys.version_info >= (3, 7)`: Let's assume this is True for now. Then `_restify_py37(cls)` is called. We don't have the code for this function, but based on the other conditions, it's likely to return a string representing the class.
    - If `sys.version_info >= (3, 7)` is False, then `_restify_py36(cls)` is called. Again, we don't have the code for this function, but it's likely to return a string representing the class.

Since we don't have the code for `_restify_py37` or `_restify_py36`, we can't determine the exact output. However, we know that the `__module__` is "tests.test_util_typing". Assuming the function behaves similarly to the other branches, it's likely to return a string containing this module name.

If we assume the Python version is 3.7 or higher, the code will likely execute the `_restify_py37` branch.  Without the implementation of `_restify_py37`, we can only infer the general structure of the output.  Given the other branches in the `restify` function, it's highly probable that `_restify_py37` will return a string representing the class, likely including the module name.
