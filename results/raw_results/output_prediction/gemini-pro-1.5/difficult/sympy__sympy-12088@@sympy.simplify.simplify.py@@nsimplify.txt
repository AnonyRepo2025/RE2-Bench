The expression `1/4 + "sqrt(5)\"/4` involves a string "sqrt(5)". `sympify` will handle this by creating a symbol `sqrt(5)` instead of interpreting it as a square root.

1. **sympify**: The input expression `1/4 + "sqrt(5)\"/4` is converted to a SymPy expression. Due to the quotes around "sqrt(5)", sympy will treat it as a symbol named `sqrt(5)` rather than a function call.
2. **_real_to_rational**: Since the expression contains a symbol, the function will attempt to convert any floats to rationals.  `1/4` becomes `Rational(1, 4)`. The symbol remains unchanged.
3. **Result**: The final result will be `1/4 + sqrt(5)/4` where `sqrt(5)` is a symbol.
