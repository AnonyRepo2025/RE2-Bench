1. The input number is a large integer.
2. `decimal_sep` is ".".
3. `grouping`, `thousand_sep`, `force_grouping`, `use_l10n`, and `decimal_pos` are not provided, so they take their default values: 0, '', False, None, and None, respectively.
4. Inside the function, `settings.USE_L10N` and `settings.USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` are accessed. These are Django settings, and we don't have information about them. Let's assume they are both False for simplicity.
5. `use_grouping` is evaluated to False.
6. Since the number is an integer, `use_grouping` is False, and `decimal_pos` is None, the function returns the number as a string, prepended with a minus sign.
