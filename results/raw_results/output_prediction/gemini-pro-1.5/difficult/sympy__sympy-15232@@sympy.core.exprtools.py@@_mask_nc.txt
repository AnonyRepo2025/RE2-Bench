Let's trace the execution of `_mask_nc` with the given input.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `expr` is set to `x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n`.
   - `rep`, `nc_obj`, and `nc_syms` are initialized as empty lists/sets.

2. **Preorder Traversal:**
   - The `preorder_traversal` function visits the nodes of the expression tree in preorder.  The important thing here is that non-commutative objects that are not Add, Mul, Pow, or Symbol are added to `nc_obj`. Since all the factors are Symbols, nothing is added to `nc_obj`. The symbols `n`, `m`, `o` are added to `nc_syms` because they appear as part of a non-commutative expression (due to being repeated within the terms). `x` is also added to `nc_syms` because it is part of a non-commutative term.

3. **Conditional Replacement:**
   - The conditions `len(nc_obj) == 1 and (not nc_syms)` and `len(nc_syms) == 1 and (not nc_obj)` are both false.

4. **Non-Commutative Symbol Replacement:**
   - The loop iterates through `nc_obj` (which is empty), so no replacements are made here.

5. **Symbol Substitution:**
   - `expr` remains unchanged: `x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n`.

6. **Sorting and Returning:**
   - `nc_syms` contains `x`, `n`, `m`, `o`. After sorting, it becomes `m`, `n`, `o`, `x`.
   - The function returns a tuple: `(expr, None, nc_syms)`.

Therefore, the output will be:

[OUTPUT]
```

    "output": [
        "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n",
        null,

            "m",
            "n",
            "o",
            "x"
        ]
    ]
}
