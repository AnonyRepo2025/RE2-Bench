Let's trace the execution of the `mrr` function with the given input.

The input `data` is a list containing a single tuple: `([0, 0, 0, 1], 4)`.

Since `data` is a list, the code enters the `if type(data) == list:` block.
The loop iterates only once with `sub_list = [0, 0, 0, 1]` and `total_num = 4`.

Inside the loop:
1. `sub_list` becomes `np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])`.
2. `total_num` is 4, so the `if total_num == 0` block is skipped.
3. `ranking_array` becomes `1.0 / (np.array([0, 1, 2, 3]) + 1)` which is `np.array([1.0, 0.5, 0.333..., 0.25])`.
4. `mr_np` becomes `sub_list * ranking_array` which is `np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25])`.
5. The loop `for team in mr_np:` iterates through `mr_np`.
   - When `team` is 0.0, the condition `team > 0` is false.
   - When `team` is 0.0, the condition `team > 0` is false.
   - When `team` is 0.0, the condition `team > 0` is false.
   - When `team` is 0.25, the condition `team > 0` is true, so `mr` becomes 0.25 and the loop breaks.
6. `separate_result.append(mr)` adds 0.25 to the initially empty list `separate_result`.

After the loop:
- `separate_result` is `[0.25]`.
- The function returns `(np.mean(separate_result), separate_result)`, which is `(0.25, [0.25])`.
