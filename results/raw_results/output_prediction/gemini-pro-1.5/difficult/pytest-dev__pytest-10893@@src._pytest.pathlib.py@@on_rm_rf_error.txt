Let's trace the execution of `on_rm_rf_error` with the given input.

1. **Check excinfo:** The `excinfo` argument is an empty dictionary, which means no exception occurred. Thus, the code inside the first `if` block (handling exceptions) will not be executed.

2. **Return False:** Since no exception is present, the function will directly return `False`.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": false        
}
```
