Here's how `_eval_product` will execute with the given input:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `term` = conjugate(A)*"conjugate(B)"**k
   - `limits` = (k, 3, 3)  (Note: the input `limits` seems to be missing the variable, assuming it's 'k' based on the `term`)

2. **Check if `k` is not in `term.free_symbols`:** This condition is false because 'k' is present in the term.

3. **Check if `a == n`:** This condition is true because `a` and `n` are both 3.

4. **Return `term.subs(k, a)`:** The function substitutes `k` with `a` (which is 3) in the `term`.

5. **Result:** The function returns conjugate(A)*"conjugate(B)"**3

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "conjugate(A)*conjugate(B)**3"
}
```
