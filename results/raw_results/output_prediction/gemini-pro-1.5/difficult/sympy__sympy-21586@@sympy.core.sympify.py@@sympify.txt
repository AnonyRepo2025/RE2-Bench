Let's trace the execution of `sympify` with the given input.

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - `a` is "{2.0, 3}".
   - `is_sympy` checks are negative.
   - No registered converter is found for the type of `a`.
   - `_is_numpy_instance(a)` is false.
   - `_sympy_` attribute check is negative.
   - Strict mode is off (default).
   - `a` is a string, so the string processing path is taken.

2. **String Processing:**
   - The code replaces newline characters in `a`, which has no effect in this case.
   - `parse_expr` is called on "{2.0, 3}".

3. **`parse_expr`:**
   - This function attempts to parse the string as a SymPy expression.
   - The string "{2.0, 3}" is not a valid SymPy expression (it looks like a set literal).
   - A `SympifyError` is raised because of invalid syntax.

Since a `SympifyError` is raised, the function execution stops there.  The `_args_set` will not be populated.  Therefore, the output will reflect that the exception was caught.

{
    "_args_set": null
