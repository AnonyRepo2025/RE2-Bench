Here's how we determine the output of the `to` method given the input:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - `other` is compared to `self.physical_unit`. They are the same object (meter unit).

2. **`to_physical` Call:**
   - The code enters the first `if` block and calls `self.to_physical(value)`.  `self.to_physical` is not provided, but based on the context, it likely converts the given `value` from the function unit to the physical unit.  The function unit has a `_scale` of -2.0.  Let's assume `to_physical` multiplies the value by 10 raised to the power of the scale.  So, `2.5 * 10**(-2.0) = 0.025`.

3. **Return:**
   - The function returns the result of `self.to_physical(value)`, which we calculated as 0.025.
