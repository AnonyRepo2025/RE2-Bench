1. The input `annotation` is not a string, not a `TypeVar`, and `inspect.isNewType(annotation)` returns `False` because the module is `tests.test_util_typing` not `typing`.
2. `annotation` is not `None`, not `NoneType`, not in `INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES`, and not `Ellipsis`.
3. `annotation.__module__` is `tests.test_util_typing`, which is not `builtins`.
4. Thus, the code reaches the last `else` block and calls `_stringify_py36` (since the provided code doesn't specify Python version, we assume it's less than 3.7). However, the implementation of `_stringify_py36` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact output.
5. Since the `annotation` has a `__module__` attribute that is not `builtins`, and it's not a handled special case, the function likely returns a string representation of the annotation.  Given the available information, a reasonable guess would be the fully qualified name.
