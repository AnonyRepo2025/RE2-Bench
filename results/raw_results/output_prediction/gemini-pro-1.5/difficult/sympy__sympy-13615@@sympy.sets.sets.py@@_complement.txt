Let's trace the execution of `_complement` with the given input.

1. **Input Processing:**
   - `self` is an empty dictionary, which means it's likely a `Set` object without any specific elements or ranges defined.  It defaults to the UniversalSet, which in this context behaves like the set of all real numbers (S.Reals).
   - `other` is a `FiniteSet` containing the elements 10 and 15.

2. **Inside `_complement`:**
   - The code enters the `elif isinstance(other, FiniteSet):` block.

3. **Sifting:**
   - The `ternary_sift` function is defined. This function checks if an element `el` is contained in `self`. Since `self` effectively represents S.Reals, `self.contains(el)` will return `True` for any real number.  In our case, both 10 and 15 are real numbers.
   - `sifted = sift(other, ternary_sift)` applies `ternary_sift` to each element of `other` (10 and 15).
   - The result will be a dictionary: `sifted = {True: [10, 15], False: [], None: []}`.

4. **Union and Complement:**
   - `FiniteSet(*sifted[False])` creates a `FiniteSet` from the elements in `sifted[False]`, which is an empty list. This results in an `EmptySet`.
   - `sifted[None]` is also an empty list.  Therefore, the condition `if sifted[None]` is false, and the `Complement` part is not executed.
   - The final result is the `Union` of `EmptySet` and `EmptySet`, which is simply `EmptySet`.

Therefore, the `_elements` of the returned set will be an empty `frozenset`.
