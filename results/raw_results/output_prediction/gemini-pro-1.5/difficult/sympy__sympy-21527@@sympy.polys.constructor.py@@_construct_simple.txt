Let's trace the execution of `_construct_simple` with the given input.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `rationals`, `floats`, `complexes`, `algebraics` are all initialized to `False`.
   - `float_numbers` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **Loop:**
   - The `for` loop is skipped because `coeffs` is `null`.

3. **Post-loop:**
   - `max_prec` is 53 because `float_numbers` is empty.

4. **Conditional:**
   - `algebraics` is `False`.
   - The `else` block is executed.

5. **Nested Conditional:**
   - `floats` and `complexes` are `False`.
   - `rationals` is `False`.
   - `opt.field` defaults to `False` (since `opt` is empty).
   - The `else` block is executed: `domain = ZZ` (integers).

6. **Result:**
   - `result = [domain.from_sympy(coeff) for coeff in coeffs]` is executed, but since `coeffs` is `null`, this will raise a `TypeError`.

Therefore, the function will raise a `TypeError` because it tries to iterate over `null`.
