Here's how we determine the output of `__eq__` given the input:

1. **Initial State:** `self` is an empty dictionary, meaning it's an instance of the `Basic` class with no arguments. `other` is the string "I*x".

2. **`self is other` check:** This is `False` since `self` is a `Basic` instance and `other` is a string.

3. **`type(self) is not type(other)` check:** This is `True`.

4. **Pow special case checks:** These are skipped because neither `self` nor `other` are `Pow` instances.

5. **_sympify(other):** The `_sympify` function is called on "I*x". This converts the string into a SymPy expression representing the product of the imaginary unit `I` and a symbol `x`.

6. **type(self) != type(other) check:** After sympification, `other` is a `Mul` object (representing multiplication), while `self` is still a `Basic` object. Thus, this condition is `True`.

7. **_hashable_content() comparison:** The code reaches the final return statement: `self._hashable_content() == other._hashable_content()`.

8. **_hashable_content() for self:** Since `self` has no arguments (`self._args` is empty), `self._hashable_content()` returns an empty tuple: `()`.

9. **_hashable_content() for other:**  `other` is now a `Mul` object representing `I*x`. Its `_hashable_content()` would be a tuple containing `I` and `x` (the factors of the multiplication).

10. **Final Comparison:** The code compares the empty tuple `()` with the tuple `(I, x)`. This comparison returns `False`.
