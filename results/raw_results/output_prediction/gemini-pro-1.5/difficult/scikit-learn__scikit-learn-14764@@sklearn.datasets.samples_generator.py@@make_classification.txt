Let's trace the execution of `make_classification` with the given inputs.

1. **Initial setup:**
   - `n_samples = 200`, `n_features = 2`, `n_informative = 2`, `n_redundant = 0`, `n_repeated = 0`, `n_classes = 4`, `n_clusters_per_class = 1`, `weights = None`, `flip_y = 0`, `class_sep = 1000000.0`, `hypercube = False`, `shift = 0`, `scale = 1`, `shuffle = False`, `random_state = 0`.
   - `generator` becomes `np.random.RandomState(0)`.
   - `n_useless = n_features - n_informative - n_redundant - n_repeated = 2 - 2 - 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - `n_clusters = n_classes * n_clusters_per_class = 4 * 1 = 4`.
   - `weights` becomes `[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]`.
   - `n_samples_per_cluster` becomes `[50, 50, 50, 50]`.
   - `X` initialized as a 200x2 array of zeros.
   - `y` initialized as a 200-element array of zeros.

2. **Centroid generation:**
   - `centroids = _generate_hypercube(4, 2, generator)`. This will generate a 4x2 array representing the centroids of the clusters. Since `random_state=0`, the output will be deterministic.
   - `centroids *= 2 * class_sep` scales the centroids by 2 * 1000000.0 = 2000000.0.
   - `centroids -= class_sep` shifts the centroids by -1000000.0.
   - Since `hypercube` is False, the centroids are further scaled by random values between 0 and 1.

3. **Data generation:**
   - `X[:, :n_informative]` is filled with random values.
   - The code then iterates through each cluster (k = 0 to 3):
     - Assigns labels to `y` based on `k % n_classes`.
     - Transforms the informative features of `X` for the current cluster using a random matrix `A`.
     - Adds the centroid to the transformed features.

4. **Redundant, repeated, and useless features:**
   - Since `n_redundant`, `n_repeated`, and `n_useless` are all 0, these steps are skipped.

5. **Flipping labels, shifting, and scaling:**
   - Since `flip_y = 0`, `shift = 0`, and `scale = 1`, these steps are skipped.

6. **Shuffling:**
   - Since `shuffle = False`, this step is skipped.

7. **Return:**
   - The function returns `(X, y)`.
