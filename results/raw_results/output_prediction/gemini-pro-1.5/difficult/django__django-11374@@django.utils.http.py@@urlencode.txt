1. The `urlencode` function checks if the input `query` is a `MultiValueDict`. It's not in this case, so it moves to the next check.
2. It checks if `query` has an `items` attribute. It doesn't, so it proceeds to the next block.
3. It initializes an empty list `query_params`.
4. The code iterates through the input `query` which is a list of lists:
   - For `['a', 1]`: `value` is 1, which is not None, a string, or bytes, and `doseq` is False. So, `query_val` becomes 1. `('a', 1)` is appended to `query_params`.
   - For `['b', 2]`: Similarly, `('b', 2)` is appended to `query_params`.
   - For `['c', 3]`: Similarly, `('c', 3)` is appended to `query_params`.
5. Finally, `original_urlencode(query_params, doseq)` is called with `query_params = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]` and `doseq = False`. This will URL-encode the list of tuples.
