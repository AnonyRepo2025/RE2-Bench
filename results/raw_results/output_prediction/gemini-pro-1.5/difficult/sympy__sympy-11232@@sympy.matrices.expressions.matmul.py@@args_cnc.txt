1. `self.as_coeff_matrices()` is called.
2. Inside `as_coeff_matrices()`:
   - `self.args` is empty, so both `scalars` and `matrices` lists will be empty.
   - `coeff` will be `Mul(*[])`, which is `1`.
   - The function returns `(1, [])`.
3. Back in `args_cnc()`:
   - `coeff` is `1`, and `matrices` is `[]`.
   - `coeff.args_cnc()` is called. Since `coeff` is `1`, which is a Number, `args_cnc()` for numbers returns a tuple of the number itself and an empty tuple: `(1, ())`.
   - Thus, `coeff_c` is `1` and `coeff_nc` is `()`.
   - The `if coeff_c == [1]:` condition is not met.
   - The `elif coeff_c == set([1]):` condition is not met.
   - The function returns `([], [] + [])`, which simplifies to `([], [])`.
