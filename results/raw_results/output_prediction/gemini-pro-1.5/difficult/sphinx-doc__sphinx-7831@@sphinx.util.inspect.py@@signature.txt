1. The `signature` function first checks if `_should_unwrap(subject)` is true.
2. `_should_unwrap` checks if the subject's globals are from the `contextlib` module. In this case, the subject doesn't have a `__globals__` attribute, so `_should_unwrap` returns `False`.
3. Since `_should_unwrap` is false, the `signature` function calls `inspect.signature(subject)` without following wrapped functions.
4. Because the input subject has a `__signature__` attribute, `inspect.signature` will use it directly.
5. The rest of the `signature` function deals with annotations and bound methods. Since there are no annotations and `bound_method` is false (default), these parts don't change the signature.
6. The function returns the signature parsed from the `__signature__` attribute, which is `(arg, kwarg=None)`.
