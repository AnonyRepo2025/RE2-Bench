Let's trace the execution of `format_line_html_text` with the given input.

1. **Initialization:** The `HtmlUtil` object is initialized with several marker attributes. These are not directly used in this specific call.

2. **`format_line_html_text` call:** The function receives the HTML string `<ul><li>Item 1</li></ul>`.

3. **`BeautifulSoup` parsing:** The HTML is parsed into a `BeautifulSoup` object.

4. **Code tag handling:** The code searches for `<pre>` and `<blockquote>` tags. Since the input HTML doesn't contain these tags, this part has no effect.

5. **List item handling:** The code finds the `<ul>` tag and its child `<li>` tag.
   - The text inside the `<li>` tag is "Item 1".
   - `li_item_text` becomes "Item 1".
   - The code checks if the last character is punctuation. It's not.
   - The code modifies the `<li>` tag's string to be "[-]Item 1.".

6. **Paragraph handling:** The code searches for `<p>` tags. Since there are none in the input, this part has no effect.

7. **Text extraction and cleaning:** `soup.get_text()` extracts the text from the modified `BeautifulSoup` object, which is now "[-]Item 1.".  `gensim.utils.decode_htmlentities` doesn't change this string as there are no HTML entities.

8. **Line feed formatting:** `__format_line_feed` replaces multiple newlines with single newlines. Since there are no newlines in the text, this part has no effect.

9. **Return:** The function returns the final string "[-]Item 1.".
