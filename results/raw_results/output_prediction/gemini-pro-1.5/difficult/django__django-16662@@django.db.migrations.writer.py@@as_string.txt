Let's trace the execution of the `as_string` method with the given input.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `items = {'replaces_str': '', 'initial_str': ''}`
   - `imports = set()`
   - `operations = []`

2. **Operations Loop:**
   - The `for` loop over `self.migration.operations` is skipped because `self.migration.operations` is `null`.

3. **Dependencies Loop:**
   - The `for` loop over `self.migration.dependencies` is skipped because it's not present in the input.

4. **Migration Imports:**
   - The loop checking for migration imports needing manual copying is skipped because `imports` is empty.

5. **Django Imports:**
   - The code adds `'from django.db import migrations'` to the `imports` set.

6. **Sorted Imports:**
   - `sorted_imports` becomes `['from django.db import migrations']`.
   - `items['imports']` is set to `'from django.db import migrations\n'`

7. **Replaces String:**
   - The `if self.migration.replaces:` block is skipped because `self.migration.replaces` is not present in the input.

8. **Header:**
   - `items['migration_header']` is set to an empty string because `self.include_header` is `false`.

9. **Initial String:**
   - The `if self.migration.initial:` block is skipped because `self.migration.initial` is not present in the input.

10. **Template Formatting:**
    - The `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE` is formatted with the collected `items`.
    - `items['operations']` is an empty string.
    - `items['dependencies']` is an empty string.

Therefore, the final output will be the `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE` filled with the computed values.

    "output": "from django.db import migrations\n\n\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\n\n\n    dependencies = [\n\n    ]\n\n    operations = [\n\n    ]\n"
