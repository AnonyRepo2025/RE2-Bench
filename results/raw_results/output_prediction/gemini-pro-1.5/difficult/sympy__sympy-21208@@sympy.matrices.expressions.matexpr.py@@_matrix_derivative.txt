Let's trace the execution of `_matrix_derivative` with the given input.

1. **_matrix_derivative(expr, x)**
   - `expr` is a MatrixExpr with shape (2, 2).
   - `x` is the symbol 'x'.

2. **expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)**
   - This calls `_eval_derivative(x)` on `expr`.

3. **expr._eval_derivative(x)**
   - This calls `applyfunc(lambda x: x.diff(x))` on `expr`.

4. **expr.applyfunc(lambda x: x.diff(x))**
   - This creates a new matrix with the same shape as `expr` (2x2).
   - Each element of the new matrix is the result of applying the lambda function to the corresponding element of `expr`.
   - Since `expr._mat` is null, we can assume it represents a symbolic matrix. Let's represent the elements of `expr` as `e_ij`, where i is the row index and j is the column index.

5. **lambda x: x.diff(x)**
   - For each element `e_ij` of `expr`, this calculates `e_ij.diff(x)`.
   - If `e_ij` is a function of `x`, the derivative will be computed.
   - If `e_ij` is not a function of `x` (e.g., a constant or a symbol other than `x`), the derivative will be 0.

6. **Creating the new matrix**
   - The new matrix will have elements `e_ij.diff(x)`.
   - Since we don't know the exact elements of `expr`, we can't determine the exact elements of the resulting matrix. However, we know its shape will be the same as `expr`, which is (2, 2).

7. **Return value**
   - The function returns the new 2x2 matrix whose elements are the derivatives of the elements of the input matrix with respect to x.

Since the input matrix `_mat` is `null`, it means the matrix is not initialized with specific values. Therefore, the derivative of each element with respect to 'x' will be calculated symbolically.  The resulting matrix will also be a 2x2 matrix, but we cannot determine the exact elements without knowing the initial symbolic elements of the input matrix.  However, the structure will be maintained.
