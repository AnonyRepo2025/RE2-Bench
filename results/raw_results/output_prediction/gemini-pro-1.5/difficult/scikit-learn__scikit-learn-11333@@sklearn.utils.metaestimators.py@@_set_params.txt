1. The `_set_params` method first checks if `attr` ("_transformers") is in `params`. It is not, so it continues.
2. It gets the current value of `_transformers` (which is `null`).
3. It initializes `names` to an empty list because `items` is `null`.
4. It iterates through the keys of `params` (which is just "n_jobs").
5. Since "n_jobs" doesn't contain "__" and is not in `names`, the `if` condition is false, and it doesn't enter the `_replace_estimator` block.
6. It calls `super().set_params(**params)`, which is `BaseEstimator.set_params`.
7. `BaseEstimator.set_params` sets the "n_jobs" attribute of `self` to 2.
8. The function returns `self`.
