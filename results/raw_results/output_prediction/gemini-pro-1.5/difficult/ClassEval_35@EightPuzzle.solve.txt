The initial state is the same as the goal state.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `open_list` is initialized with the initial state and an empty path: `[([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]], [])]`
   - `closed_list` is initialized as empty: `[]`

2. **Main Loop (First Iteration):**
   - The `while open_list` loop starts.
   - `current_state`, `path` are assigned the first element from `open_list`: `current_state = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]`, `path = []`
   - `current_state` is added to `closed_list`: `closed_list = [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]]`
   - The `if current_state == self.goal_state` condition is checked. Since the initial state is the goal state, this condition is `True`.
   - The function immediately returns `path`, which is `[]`.

Therefore, the output will be an empty list.
