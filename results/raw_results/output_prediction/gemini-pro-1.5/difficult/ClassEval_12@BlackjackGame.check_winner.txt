Let's trace the execution of `check_winner` with the given inputs.

1. **Player hand value:**
   - 2S: 2
   - 4S: 4
   - 5S: 5
   - Total: 2 + 4 + 5 = 11

2. **Dealer hand value:**
   - 2S: 2
   - JS: 10
   - QS: 10
   - Total: 2 + 10 + 10 = 22

3. **Check winner logic:**
   - Player value (11) is not greater than 21.
   - Dealer value (22) is greater than 21.
   - Therefore, the function returns "Player wins".

```
{
    "output": "Player wins"        
}
