Let's trace the execution of `call_command` with the given inputs.

1. **command_name Resolution:** The input `command_name` is "transaction". The `get_commands()` function is called. This function retrieves available Django commands. Let's assume "transaction" is a valid command and maps to the app_name "django.core".

2. **Command Loading:** Since the command is assumed to be valid, `load_command_class("django.core", "transaction")` is called. This imports the `transaction` command's module and instantiates the `Command` class within it.

3. **Parser Creation:** `command.create_parser('', "transaction")` is called. This creates a `CommandParser` instance, adds arguments (including base arguments like `--version`, `--verbosity`, etc.), and then calls `command.add_arguments(parser)` to add command-specific arguments.

4. **Options Handling:** The code then processes the provided `options` ({"stdout": {}, "no_color": True}). It maps option names to their destinations, handles mutually exclusive options, and checks for unknown options.  Since `no_color` is True, the style will be set to `no_style()`.

5. **Argument Parsing:** The `parser.parse_args()` function is called with the combined arguments. This populates the `defaults` dictionary with parsed option values.

6. **Command Execution:** Finally, `command.execute(*args, **defaults)` is called. This executes the `transaction` command with the parsed arguments and options. Since we don't have the actual `transaction` command's code, we can't determine the exact output. However, we know that the command will execute with `no_color` set to True, meaning the output won't be colorized.

Based on the provided information, we can't predict the exact output of the `transaction` command. We can only infer that the command will be executed with the specified options.
