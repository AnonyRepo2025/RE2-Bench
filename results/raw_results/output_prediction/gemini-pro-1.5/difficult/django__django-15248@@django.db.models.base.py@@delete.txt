Here's how the `delete` function unfolds with the given input:

1. **Initial Checks:** The `delete` function first checks if `self.pk` is None. In this case, `self.pk` is equivalent to `self.id`, which is 99998. Since it's not None, the deletion process continues.

2. **Database Routing:** The `using` argument is not provided in `kwargs`, so the `router.db_for_write` function is called. This function determines which database to use for the delete operation. Given that `self._state.db` is "default", the router will likely return "default".

3. **Collector Initialization:** A `Collector` instance is created with the chosen database ("default") and the model instance (`self`) as the origin.

4. **Collector.collect():** This is where the core deletion logic resides. Let's trace its execution:
   - **Fast Delete Check:** The `can_fast_delete` function is called. This checks if the object can be deleted quickly without cascading or signals. Given the complexity of a typical Django model (potential related objects, signals, etc.), it's unlikely that `can_fast_delete` will return True.
   - **Adding to Collector:** The `add` method of the collector adds the instance to its internal data structures.
   - **Parent Collection (if not keep_parents):** The `keep_parents` argument is False (default). The code iterates through the model's parents and recursively calls `collect` on them. This ensures that related parent objects are also deleted (unless they have other children).
   - **Related Object Collection:** The code iterates through related objects and calls the appropriate `on_delete` method for each. This handles cascading deletes, setting related fields to null, etc.  This step is crucial and depends on the `on_delete` settings defined in the model's fields.
   - **Protected Checks:** If any related objects have `on_delete=PROTECT`, a `ProtectedError` is raised, preventing the deletion.
   - **Fast Deletes (if any):**  If any related objects qualified for fast deletion, they are deleted here.
   - **Private Fields:**  Handles any private fields with special deletion logic.
   - **Restricted Checks:** If any related objects have `on_delete=RESTRICT`, a `RestrictedError` is raised, preventing the deletion.

5. **Collector.delete():** After `collect` has gathered all the objects to be deleted, this method performs the actual database queries to delete them.

6. **Return Value:** The `delete` function returns the result of `collector.delete()`, which is a tuple containing two elements:
   - The number of objects deleted.
   - A dictionary mapping object types to the number of deletions for each type.

Given the provided input and the typical structure of Django models, it's highly probable that related objects exist.  Without knowing the exact model definition and its relationships, it's impossible to predict the exact contents of the returned dictionary. However, we can predict the structure.
