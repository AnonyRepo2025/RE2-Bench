1. The `fit` method first validates the estimators and initializes `self.estimators_` and `self.named_estimators_`.
2. Since `self.estimators` is `null`, `self._validate_estimators()` will raise an error, but we are only asked for the values of the attributes after the assignment in the code.
3. `self.weights` and `self.n_jobs` remain unchanged because they are not reassigned in the provided code snippet.
4. `self.estimators_` is assigned the result of `Parallel(n_jobs=self.n_jobs)(...)`, which depends on the estimators. Since `self.estimators` is `null`, this will result in an empty list.
5. `self.named_estimators_` is initialized as an empty `Bunch`.
