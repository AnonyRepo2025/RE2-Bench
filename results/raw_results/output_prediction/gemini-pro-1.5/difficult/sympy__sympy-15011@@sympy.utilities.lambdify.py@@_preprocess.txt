Here's how we determine the output of `_preprocess`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `args` (the input argument list) is empty.
   - `expr` is "x**2".
   - `self._dummify` is `False`.

2. **Loop:** The main loop in `_preprocess` iterates through the `args` list. Since `args` is empty, the loop doesn't execute.

3. **Return:** The function returns a tuple: `(argstrs, expr)`.
   - `argstrs` will be an empty list because the loop never ran.
   - `expr` remains unchanged as "x**2".

Therefore, the output will be:

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [
        [],
        "x**2"
    ]        
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
