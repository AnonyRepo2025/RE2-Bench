Initial state:
```
#####
#O  #  Player at (1, 2)
# X #  Box at (2, 2)
#  G#  Target at (3, 3)
#####
```

1. **move('s')**:
   - `new_player_row = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - `new_player_col = 2`
   - `self.map[2][2] == 'X'` which is not '#'.
   - The new player position (2, 2) contains a box.
   - `new_box_row = 2 + (2 - 1) = 3`
   - `new_box_col = 2 + (2 - 2) = 2`
   - `self.map[3][2] == ' '` which is not '#'.
   - The box is moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2).
   - The player moves to (2, 2).

State after move:
```
#####
#   #
#O X#  Player at (2, 2), Box at (3, 2)
#  G#  Target at (3, 3)
#####
```

2. **check_win()**:
   - `box_on_target_count = 0`
   - The box is at (3, 2), the target is at (3, 3).
   - `box_on_target_count` remains 0.
   - `self.target_count` is 1.
   - The condition `box_on_target_count == self.target_count` is false.
   - `self.is_game_over` remains false.
   - The function returns `False`.
