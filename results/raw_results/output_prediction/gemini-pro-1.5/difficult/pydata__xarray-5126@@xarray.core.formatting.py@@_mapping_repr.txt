Let's trace the execution of `_mapping_repr` with the given inputs.

1. **Initial setup:**
   - `col_width` is calculated using `_calculate_col_width`. The input is `{"foo": "bar"}`, so `max_name_length` becomes `len("foo")` which is 3. `col_width` becomes `max(3, 7) + 6 = 7 + 6 = 13`.
   - `max_rows` is set to `OPTIONS['display_max_rows']`. We don't have the value for this, but it won't affect the output in this case because the mapping has only one item.
   - `summary` is initialized as `["Attributes:"]`.

2. **Mapping is not empty:**
   - The `if mapping:` block is executed.
   - `len_mapping` is 1.
   - `_get_boolean_with_default("display_expand_attrs", default=True)` is called. Assuming `OPTIONS["display_expand_attrs"]` is either not set or set to "default", this returns `True`.
   - The `elif` and `else` blocks inside the `if len_mapping > max_rows` are skipped because `len_mapping` (1) is not greater than `max_rows`.
   - The `else` block associated with `if not _get_boolean_with_default(...)` is also skipped.
   - The loop `for k, v in mapping.items():` runs once with `k = "foo"` and `v = "bar"`.
   - `summarizer(k, v, col_width)` is called. We don't have the implementation of `summarizer` (which is `summarize_attr` in this case), but we know that it's used to format the key-value pair. Let's assume it formats the output as `"foo": "bar"`. The `col_width` argument might add padding, but we don't know for sure without the implementation of `summarize_attr`. However, the example in the docstring suggests that the output will be similar to `"    foo: bar"`.

3. **Final output:**
   - The `else` block associated with `if mapping:` is skipped.
   - `'\n'.join(summary)` joins the elements of `summary` with newlines.

Based on this analysis, the output will be "Attributes:" followed by the representation of the single key-value pair in the mapping.
