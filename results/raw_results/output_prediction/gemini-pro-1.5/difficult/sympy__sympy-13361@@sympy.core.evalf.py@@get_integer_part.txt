Let's trace the execution of `get_integer_part` with the given inputs.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `expr` = 1/2
   - `no` = -1
   - `options` = {}
   - `return_ints` = True

2. **`evalf(expr, assumed_size, options)`:**
   - `evalf` is called with `expr` = 1/2, `prec` = 30, and `options` = {}.
   - `evalf` computes the numerical approximation of 1/2, which is 0.5 with high precision.
   - `ire` will be the mpf representation of 0.5, `iim` will be None, `ire_acc` will be close to 30, and `iim_acc` will be None.

3. **Gap Calculation:**
   - Since only `ire` is present, `gap` = fastlog(ire) - ire_acc. This will be a negative value.

4. **Margin Check and Re-evaluation:**
   - `gap` is negative, so the condition `gap >= -margin` (where margin = 10) is met.
   - `evalf` is called again with higher precision, but the result will still be essentially 0.5 with high accuracy.

5. **`calc_part` calls:**
   - Only `ire` is present, so `calc_part` is called once with `expr` = 1/2 and `nexpr` = `ire` (mpf for 0.5).
   - Inside `calc_part`:
     - `nint` = int(0.5) = 0
     - `is_int` is False.
     - The code enters the `if not is_int` block.
     - `expr` becomes 1/2 - 0 = 1/2.
     - `evalf(expr, 10, options)` returns the mpf for 0.5 with accuracy 10.
     - `check_target` is called and passes.
     - `nint` remains 0 because `no` is -1 and `x` (0.5) is positive, so the condition `mpf_cmp(x, fzero) == no` is false.
     - `calc_part` returns (0, INF).

6. **Return:**
   - `re_` is 0, `im_` is None.
   - Since `return_ints` is true, the function returns `(int(re_), int(im_))` which is `(0, 0)`.
