1. **Initial state:**
   - `self` is an empty MutableSparseMatrix (0x0).
   - `other` is a 2x1 matrix. Although `_mat` is null, we know it's not a SparseMatrix because the input specifies it within "args".

2. **First `if` condition:**
   - `self.rows == 0` is true.
   - `self.cols != other.cols` is true (0 != 1).
   - The code enters the `if` block and recursively calls `col_join`:
     `return self._new(0, other.cols, []).col_join(other)`

3. **Recursive call:**
   - `self._new(0, other.cols, [])` creates a new MutableSparseMatrix named `A` with dimensions 0x1 and an empty `_smat`.
   - `A.col_join(other)` is called.

4. **Inside the recursive `col_join`:**
   - `A.rows == 0` is true.
   - `A.cols == B.cols` is true (1 == 1).
   - The code proceeds to the copying step: `A = A.copy()`. This doesn't change anything since `A` was just created.

5. **The `if not isinstance(B, SparseMatrix)` block is entered:**
   - Since `other` (which is `B` here) is not a SparseMatrix, this block is executed.
   - The code iterates through the rows and columns of `B` (which is `other`). Since we don't have the actual `_mat` data for `other`, we'll assume it's filled with symbolic zeros (consistent with how an empty matrix would behave).
   - The code adds entries to `A._smat` based on the values in `B._mat`. Since we assume `B._mat` contains zeros, and the code only adds entries for non-zero values, `A._smat` remains empty.

6. **After the loops:**
   - `A.rows` becomes `A.rows + B.rows = 0 + 2 = 2`.

7. **Return:**
   - The function returns `A`, which has:
     - `_smat`: {}
     - `rows`: 2
     - `cols`: 1
