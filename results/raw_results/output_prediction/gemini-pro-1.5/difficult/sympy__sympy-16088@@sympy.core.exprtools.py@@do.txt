Here's how we determine the output of the `do` function within `factor_terms`, given the provided input:

1. **Input Processing:** The input expression `expr` is `-("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3) + "sqrt(3)"*I*("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3)`. Notice the strings around sqrt(21) and sqrt(3). These will be treated as symbols. Let's represent sqrt(21) as 'a' and sqrt(3) as 'b' for simplicity in our analysis. So, the expression becomes `-(a + 5)**(1/3) + b*I*(a + 5)**(1/3)`.

2. **Initial Checks:** The code first checks if the expression is an atom or a basic type. Since our expression is neither, it proceeds to the next condition.

3. **Recursive Call:** The code then checks if the expression is a `Pow`, `Function`, iterable, or doesn't have `args_cnc`. Our expression is an `Add`, which has `args_cnc`, so it skips this block.

4. **Sum/Integral Check:** The expression is not a `Sum` or `Integral`, so it moves on.

5. **Content and Primitive:** The `as_content_primitive` function is called. For the given expression, the content is 1 and the primitive is the expression itself.

6. **Add Processing:** The code enters the `elif p.is_Add` block. It iterates through the arguments of the addition: `-(a + 5)**(1/3)` and `b*I*(a + 5)**(1/3)`.

7. **Inner `do` Calls:** The `do` function is called recursively on each argument. Since these arguments are now `Mul` and `Pow`, the recursive calls will eventually return the same arguments unchanged.

8. **Special Handling:** The code checks for special cases where exponents are `Mul`. This doesn't apply to our expression.

9. **gcd_terms:** The `gcd_terms` function is called on the Add expression.  Since there are no common factors between `-(a + 5)**(1/3)` and `b*I*(a + 5)**(1/3)`, the expression remains unchanged.

10. **_keep_coeff:** Finally, `_keep_coeff` is called with the content (1) and the primitive (the original expression). This function essentially reconstructs the expression with the given content and primitive.

Therefore, the `do` function will return the original expression unchanged.
