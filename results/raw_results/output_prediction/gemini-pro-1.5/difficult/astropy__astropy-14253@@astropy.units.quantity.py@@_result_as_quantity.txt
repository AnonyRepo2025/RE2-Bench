The `_result_as_quantity` method checks if the `result` is a tuple or list. In this case, it's a float (11.5), so it goes to the next condition.

Since `out` is `None`, the method checks if `unit` is `None`.  `unit` is *not* `None`, so it calls `self._new_view(result, unit, finalize=False)`.  This creates a new Quantity object (a view in this case because `finalize` is False) with the given `result` and `unit`. The `_new_view` method (not shown) will create a new Quantity object with the provided numerical value and unit.

Therefore, the output will be a Quantity object with a value of 11.5 and a unit of meter.  The structure provided wants the `_unit` attribute of this returned Quantity.  This will be the same as the input `unit`.
