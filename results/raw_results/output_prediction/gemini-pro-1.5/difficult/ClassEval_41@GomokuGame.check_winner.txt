The `check_winner` function checks if there are five consecutive identical symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

1. **Outer loops:** The code iterates through each cell of the 10x10 board.

2. **Inner loop:** For each cell, it checks all four directions: horizontal (0, 1), vertical (1, 0), diagonal (1, 1), and anti-diagonal (1, -1).

3. **_check_five_in_a_row:** This function checks if there are five consecutive identical symbols starting from the current cell (row, col) in the given direction (dx, dy).

Let's trace the execution for the given input:

- **First row:** The first row has five 'O's in a row. Starting from (0, 0), the horizontal check will find five 'O's and return 'O'.

Therefore, the function will return 'O'.
