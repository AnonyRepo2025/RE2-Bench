1. The `_build_repr` function aims to create a string representation of an object, similar to what `repr()` would do.
2. It first gets the class and its initializer.
3. It then extracts the parameter names from the initializer's signature, excluding 'self' and *kwargs. In this case, the `self` object has an attribute `n_groups`, but it's not a parameter of `__init__`.
4. It initializes an empty dictionary `params`.
5. The code iterates through the parameter names (which is empty in this case).
6. Inside the loop, it tries to get the value of each parameter from the object. If the parameter is not found, it checks `self.cvargs`.
7. If a DeprecationWarning is raised while getting the attribute, the parameter is skipped.
8. Finally, it formats the class name and the parameters into a string.

Since `args` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `params` will remain empty. Therefore, the output will be the class name followed by empty parentheses. Since the input doesn't specify the class name, let's assume the class name is `MyClass`.
