The `create_method` function takes a name and a method as input and returns a new function called `manager_method`. The returned function is decorated with `@wraps(method)`, which means the metadata of the original `method` is copied to `manager_method`.  The important part for this question is that the `__wrapped__` attribute of the returned function will be set to the original `method`. Since the input provides an empty dictionary `{}` for `method`, the `__wrapped__` attribute of the returned function will also be `{}`.

```
{
    "__wrapped__": {}
}
