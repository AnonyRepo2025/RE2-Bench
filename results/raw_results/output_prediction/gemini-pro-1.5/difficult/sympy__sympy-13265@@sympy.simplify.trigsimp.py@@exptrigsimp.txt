Here's how `exptrigsimp` simplifies the given expression:

1. **Initial Expression:** The input expression is `(1 + exp(2))/(y*(-1 + exp(2)))`.

2. **bottom_up with exp_trig:** The `bottom_up` function traverses the expression tree. The `exp_trig` function attempts to rewrite parts of the expression in terms of `exp`, `cos`, or keep the original form, choosing the one with the fewest operations. In this case, exp(2) remains as it is.

3. **bottom_up with f:** The second `bottom_up` call uses the function `f` to attempt further simplification.  The function `f` checks for patterns involving exponentials and tries to rewrite them using hyperbolic or trigonometric functions. However, the given expression doesn't match those patterns. The expression remains unchanged.

4. **hyper_as_trig and TR2i:** Since the expression doesn't contain hyperbolic functions, these steps don't change the expression.

5. **TR2i (second call):** This step also doesn't modify the expression as it doesn't contain trigonometric functions.

6. **Final Result:** The function returns the original expression because none of the simplification steps could modify it.
