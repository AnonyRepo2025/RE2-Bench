1. The function starts by checking if `kernel_params` is None. In this case, it is, so it initializes an empty dictionary `params = {}`.
2. It then checks if the kernel is callable or 'precomputed'. The kernel is "polynomial", which is neither.
3. It iterates through the `KERNEL_PARAMS` for the given kernel. `KERNEL_PARAMS["polynomial"]` is `['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree']`.
4. For each parameter in the list above, it checks if the corresponding attribute of `self` is not None.
5. `self.gamma` is None, so it's skipped.
6. `self.coef0` is 0.1, so it's added to `params`: `params['coef0'] = 0.1`.
7. `self.degree` is 3.1, so it's added to `params`: `params['degree'] = 3.1`.
8. The function returns the `params` dictionary.
