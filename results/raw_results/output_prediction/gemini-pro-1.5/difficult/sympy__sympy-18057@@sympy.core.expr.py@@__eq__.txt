1. **`__eq__(self, other)` is called:** The input `other` is the string "picoweber".

2. **`_sympify(other)` is called:** This attempts to convert the string "picoweber" into a SymPy object.

3. **`sympify(a, strict=True)` is called:** Inside `sympify`, it checks if "picoweber" is a known SymPy object or a number. It is neither.

4. **Parsing "picoweber":**  `sympify` then tries to parse "picoweber" as a symbol. Since "picoweber" is a valid symbol name, it creates a `Symbol` object named "picoweber".

5. **Type comparison:** The original `self` is an `Expr` object (since no specific class is given in the input, it defaults to the base class). The `other` is now a `Symbol` object. Since the types are different, and neither are numbers, the function immediately returns `False`.
