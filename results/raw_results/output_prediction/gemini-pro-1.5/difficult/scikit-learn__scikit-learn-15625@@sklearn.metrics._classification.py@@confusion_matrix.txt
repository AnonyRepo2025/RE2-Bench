1. **_check_targets**: `y_true` and `y_pred` are both strings, but will be converted to 1D numpy arrays. Both are multiclass.
2. **unique_labels**: Since `labels` is None, it will be computed as the unique values in `y_true` and `y_pred`, which are [0, 1, 2].
3. **label_to_ind**: This dictionary maps labels to indices: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}.
4. **y_true and y_pred conversion**: Both `y_true` and `y_pred` are converted to numpy arrays using the `label_to_ind` mapping. Values not in the mapping would be assigned index 3, but since all values are present in the mapping, this doesn't happen here.
5. **Filtering**: The `ind` variable selects elements where both `y_true` and `y_pred` are less than `n_labels` (which is 3). This condition is true for all elements in this case, so no filtering occurs.
6. **Confusion matrix creation**: A coo_matrix is created and then converted to a dense array. The shape is (3, 3) because there are 3 unique labels. The matrix is populated based on the counts of (y_true, y_pred) pairs.
7. **Normalization**: `normalize` is None, so no normalization is performed.
8. **Return**: The function returns the confusion matrix `cm`.

Based on the above reasoning, the confusion matrix will be:

```
[[40  0  0]
 [20 40  0]
 [ 0  0  4]]
```

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [[40, 0, 0], [20, 40, 0], [0, 0, 4]]
}
```
