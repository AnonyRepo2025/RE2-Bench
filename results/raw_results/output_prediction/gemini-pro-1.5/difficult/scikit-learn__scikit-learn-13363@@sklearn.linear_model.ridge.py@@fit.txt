Here's how we determine the output of the `fit` method given the input:

1. **Input Processing:**
   - X and y are converted to numpy arrays. `sample_weight` is a scalar.
   - `check_X_y` confirms compatibility and consistent lengths.  Since `solver="auto"`, `dtype` will be inferred as float64 for both X and y.
   - `_preprocess_data` centers and scales X and y based on `fit_intercept` and `normalize` (both determined by `self`). Since `sample_weight` is provided, it's used in the scaling process.

2. **Core Logic:**
   - The `if` condition `sparse.issparse(X)` is false because X is dense.
   - The `else` block is executed.
   - `_ridge_regression` is called with `X`, `y`, `alpha`, `sample_weight`, `solver`, etc.  Since `solver` is 'auto', the function will select the appropriate solver for dense input and provided parameters (likely 'cholesky', 'svd', or others depending on the sklearn version).
   - `_ridge_regression` returns the calculated coefficients (`coef_`) and the number of iterations (`n_iter_`).
   - `_set_intercept` calculates and sets the intercept based on preprocessed data.

3. **Output:**
   - The `fit` method returns `self`. The relevant attributes of `self` are modified in place: `coef_`, `n_iter_`, and `intercept_`.

Therefore, the output will be the `self` object with updated `coef_`, `n_iter_`, and `intercept_`.  The other attributes remain unchanged.
