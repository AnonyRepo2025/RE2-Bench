The `__repr__` method calls `_build_repr(self)`.  Since the definition of `_build_repr` is not provided, and no other information about the class is given other than it inherits from `ABCMeta` (which doesn't define a `__repr__`), we can't determine the exact output.  However, a reasonable guess is that it will output a representation of the object including the provided attributes.

    "output": "PredefinedSplit(test_fold=[1 1 2 2], unique_folds=[1 2])"
}
