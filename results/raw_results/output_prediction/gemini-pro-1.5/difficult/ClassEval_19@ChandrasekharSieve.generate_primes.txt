Let's trace the execution of `generate_primes(self)` with `self.n = 15`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `sieve` is initialized as `[True] * 16`.
   - `p` is initialized to 2.

2. **Outer loop (while p * p <= n):**
   - **p = 2:**
     - `sieve[p]` is True.
     - Inner loop iterates from 4 to 15 with a step of 2, setting `sieve[4]`, `sieve[6]`, `sieve[8]`, `sieve[10]`, `sieve[12]`, and `sieve[14]` to False.
   - **p = 3:**
     - `sieve[p]` is True.
     - Inner loop iterates from 9 to 15 with a step of 3, setting `sieve[9]`, `sieve[12]`, and `sieve[15]` to False.
   - **p = 4:**
     - `sieve[p]` is False (already marked in the previous iteration).
   - **p = 5:**
     - `sieve[p]` is True.
     - Inner loop iterates from 25 to 15 with a step of 5. This loop doesn't execute as 25 > 15.

3. **Collecting primes:**
   - The code iterates from 2 to 15.
   - `primes` will contain indices where `sieve[i]` is True: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

Therefore, the function returns `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`.
