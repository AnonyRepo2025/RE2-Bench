Here's how `check_balanced_brackets` executes with the given input:

1. **`clear_expr()`:** The `expr` is already just brackets, so this function doesn't change it. `expr` remains "[(){}"

2. **Loop:**
   - `[`:  `[` is in `left_brackets`. `stack` becomes `["["]`.
   - `(`: `(` is in `left_brackets`. `stack` becomes `["[", "("]`.
   - `)`: `)` is in `right_brackets`. `Current_Brkt` becomes `(` (popped from `stack`). The if condition `Current_Brkt == '(' and Brkt != ')'` is false, so execution continues. `stack` is now `["["]`.
   - `{`: `{` is in `left_brackets`. `stack` becomes `["[", "{"]`.
   - `}`: `}` is in `right_brackets`. `Current_Brkt` becomes `{` (popped from `stack`). The if condition `Current_Brkt == '{' and Brkt != '}'` is false, so execution continues. `stack` is now `["["]`.

3. **After the loop:** `stack` is `["["]`, which is not empty. Therefore, the function returns `False`.
