Let's trace the execution of `_eval_subs` with the given input.

1. **Initial Check:** The function first checks if `self` is the same as `old`. In this case, `self` is an `Application` instance and `old` is a `FunctionClass` instance. They are not the same, so the code proceeds.

2. **_eval_subs Call:** The function calls `self._eval_subs(old, new)`. The `Application` class's `_eval_subs` method is called. This method returns `None` by default.

3. **Fallback Function:** Since `_eval_subs` returned `None`, the `fallback` function is executed.

4. **Iteration through Arguments:** The `fallback` function iterates through the arguments of `self`. In this case, `self` has no arguments (`self.args` is an empty tuple). Therefore, the loop does not execute.

5. **No Changes:** Since the loop didn't execute, the `hit` variable remains `False`.

6. **Return self:** Because `hit` is `False`, the `fallback` function returns `self` unchanged.

Therefore, the output of `_eval_subs` is the original `self` object.
