1. The `urlencode` function checks if the input `query` is a `MultiValueDict`. It's not in this case, so it moves to the next check.
2. It checks if `query` has an `items` method. It doesn't, so it proceeds to the next block.
3. The code iterates through the `query` list of lists.
4. Inside the loop, for each `(key, value)` pair, it checks if `value` is `None`. It's not in any of the cases.
5. It then checks if `doseq` is false or if `value` is a string or bytes. `doseq` is false (default value), so the `else` block is skipped.
6. `query_params` becomes a list of tuples: `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`.
7. Finally, `original_urlencode` is called with `query_params` and `doseq=False`. This will URL-encode the list of tuples.
