Here's how `factor_terms(R3 + R4 + 4050)` evaluates, along with the reasoning:

1. **sympify(expr):** The input expression "R3 + R4 + 4050" is converted into a SymPy expression.  Assuming R3 and R4 are symbols, this becomes `Add(Symbol('R3'), Symbol('R4'), Integer(4050))`.

2. **do(expr):**
   - The expression is an Add instance, so it goes into the `if p.is_Add` block.
   - `list_args` becomes `[R3, R4, 4050]` after each argument is recursively processed by `do`.
   - The `all` condition checks if all terms can be multiplied by -1. This is false.
   - `special` remains empty.
   - `p` remains `Add(R3, R4, 4050)`.
   - `gcd_terms(p, isprimitive=True, clear=clear, fraction=fraction)` is called. Since there are no common factors (other than 1) among the terms, this returns the original expression `Add(R3, R4, 4050)`.
   - `rv = _keep_coeff(cont, p, clear=clear, sign=sign)` is called with `cont=1` and `p=Add(R3, R4, 4050)`. This simply returns `Add(R3, R4, 4050)`.

3. **Return:** The function returns the simplified expression, which is the same as the input in this case.
