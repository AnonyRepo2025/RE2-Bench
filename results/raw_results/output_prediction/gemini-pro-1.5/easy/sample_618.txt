Here's how the execution unfolds:

1. **`fill[:n]`**: This slices the `fill` string from the beginning up to index `n`. In our case, `fill` is "8" and `n` is 2. Since the string "8" only has one character, slicing up to index 2 will return the entire string "8".

2. **`fill[:n] + match`**: This concatenates the result of the slice with the `match` string. So, "8" + "9" results in "89".
