Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Initial values:**
   - `txt` = "i like you"
   - `sep` = " "
   - `sep_count` = -1
   - `o` = ""

2. **`while` loop condition:**
   - The condition `sep_count > 0` is `False` from the start because `sep_count` is -1.
   - Therefore, the `while` loop never executes.

3. **Return statement:**
   - The code directly proceeds to the `return o + txt` statement.
   - Since `o` is "" and `txt` is "i like you", the function returns "i like you".
