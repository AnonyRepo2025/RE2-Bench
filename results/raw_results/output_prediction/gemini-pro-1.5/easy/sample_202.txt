1. The function `f` takes `array` and `list` as input.
2. `array.extend(list)` modifies `array` in-place by appending elements from `list` to it. So, `array` becomes `[2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1]`.
3. `[e for e in array if e % 2 == 0]` creates a new list containing only even numbers from `array`. This new list is not assigned to any variable, so it doesn't affect the original `array`.
4. `return [e for e in array if e >= 10]` creates a new list containing elements from `array` that are greater than or equal to 10 and returns this list.

Therefore, the function will return `[15, 15, 15]`.
