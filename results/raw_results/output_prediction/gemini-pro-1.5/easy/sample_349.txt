Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given input dictionary.

1. **Initial dictionary:**
   ```
   {
       "noeohqhk": 623,
       "1049": 55
   }
   ```

2. **`dictionary[1049] = 55`:** This line assigns the value 55 to the key "1049". Since the key "1049" already exists with the value 55, this line doesn't change the dictionary.

3. **`key, value = dictionary.popitem()`:** This line removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary. Let's assume "1049": 55 is removed (although it could be the other one, the final result will be the same because of the next step). The dictionary becomes:
   ```
   {
       "noeohqhk": 623
   }
   ```
   And `key` will be "1049", `value` will be 55.

4. **`dictionary[key] = value`:** This line adds the popped key-value pair back into the dictionary. So, the dictionary becomes:
   ```
   {
       "noeohqhk": 623,
       "1049": 55
   }
   ```

5. **`return dictionary`:** The function returns the modified dictionary.

Therefore, the final dictionary will be:
```
{
    "noeohqhk": 623,
    "1049": 55
}
```

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "noeohqhk": 623,
    "1049": 55
}
