Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Initial values:** `s = "@@@ff"` and `ch = "@"`
2. **`if ch in s:`:** This condition is true since "@" is present in "@@@ff".
3. **`sl = s.lstrip(ch)`:** This removes leading occurrences of `ch` ("@") from `s`.  `sl` becomes "ff".
4. **`if len(sl) == 0:`:** This condition is false since the length of "ff" is 2.
5. **`return sl`:** The function returns the value of `sl`, which is "ff".
