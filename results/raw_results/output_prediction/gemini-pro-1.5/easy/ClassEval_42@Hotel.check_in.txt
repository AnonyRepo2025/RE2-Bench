Here's how the `check_in` method execution flows with the given input:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `self.name`: "Test Hotel"
   - `self.available_rooms`: {"single": 1, "double": 2}
   - `self.booked_rooms`: {"single": {}}

2. **`check_in("single", 2, "guest 1")`**

3. **`if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():`**:  `room_type` is "single", which *is* a key in `self.booked_rooms`, so this condition is false. The code proceeds to the next block.

4. **`if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:`**: `name` is "guest 1". `self.booked_rooms[room_type]` is `self.booked_rooms["single"]`, which is an empty dictionary `{}`.  "guest 1" is *not* in this empty dictionary. Therefore, this condition is false.

5. **Return False:** Since the second `if` condition is false, no further code is executed within the function. The function returns `False`.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": false
