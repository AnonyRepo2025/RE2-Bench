Here's how the function `f` executes with the given inputs:

1. **Initial values:**
   - `line = "$78"`
   - `char = "$"`

2. **Count occurrences:**
   - `count = line.count(char)` which results in `count = 1`.

3. **Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `count + 1` (which is 2) down to 1 (exclusive of 0), with a step of -1.

   - **Iteration 1: `i = 2`**
     - `line = line.center(len(line) + i // len(char), char)`
     - `len(line)` is 3.
     - `i // len(char)` is `2 // 1 = 2`.
     - So, `line.center(3 + 2, char)` becomes `line.center(5, "$")`.
     - `"$78"` centered in a string of length 5 with `"$"` as padding becomes `"$78$"`.
     - `line` is now `"$78$"`.

   - **Iteration 2: `i = 1`**
     - `line = line.center(len(line) + i // len(char), char)`
     - `len(line)` is 4.
     - `i // len(char)` is `1 // 1 = 1`.
     - So, `line.center(4 + 1, char)` becomes `line.center(5, "$")`.
     - `"$78$"` centered in a string of length 5 with `"$"` as padding becomes `"$78$"` (no change as it's already centered).
     - `line` remains `"$78$"`.

4. **Return:**
   - The function returns the final value of `line`, which is `"$78$"`.
