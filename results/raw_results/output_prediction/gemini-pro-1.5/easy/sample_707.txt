Here's how the code executes with the given input:

1. **`text = "undbs l"`** and **`position = 1`**.
2. **`length = len(text)`**: `length` becomes 7.
3. **`index = position % (length + 1)`**: `index` becomes `1 % (7 + 1)` which is `1 % 8`, resulting in `1`.
4. The `if` condition checks if `position < 0` or `index < 0`. Since neither is true (position is 1 and index is 1), the code inside the `if` block is skipped.
5. **`new_text = list(text)`**: `new_text` becomes `['u', 'n', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l']`.
6. **`new_text.pop(index)`**: This removes the element at index 1 (the second element) from `new_text`. So 'n' is removed, and `new_text` becomes `['u', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l']`.
7. **`return ''.join(new_text)`**: This joins the characters in `new_text` back into a string. The returned string is "udbs l".
