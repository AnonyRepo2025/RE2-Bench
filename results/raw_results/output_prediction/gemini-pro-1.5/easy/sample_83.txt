Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given input "qq0tt".

1. **l = text.rpartition('0')**: This partitions the string `text` into three parts based on the last occurrence of '0'.
   - `l[0]` becomes the part before the last '0': "qq"
   - `l[1]` becomes the separator itself: "0"
   - `l[2]` becomes the part after the last '0': "tt"

2. **if l[2] == '':**: This condition checks if the part after the last '0' is empty. In our case, `l[2]` is "tt", which is not empty. So, the `if` block is skipped.

3. **return f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find('0') + 1}'**: This line calculates the length of `l[0]` (which is 2) and finds the index of the first '0' in `l[2]`. Since '0' is not present in "tt", `l[2].find('0')` returns -1. Adding 1 to it gives 0. The function then returns the string "2:0".
