The function `truncate_number` takes a float `number` as input and returns the result of the modulo operation `number % 1.0`. The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of a division. In this case, it will return the fractional part of the number.

Given the input `number = 3.5`, the operation `3.5 % 1.0` will return the remainder when 3.5 is divided by 1.0.  Since 3.5 divided by 1.0 is 3 with a remainder of 0.5, the function will return 0.5.
