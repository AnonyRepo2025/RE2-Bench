Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given input `nums = []`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `asc` is initialized as a copy of `nums`, so `asc = []`.
   - `desc` is initialized as an empty list, so `desc = []`.

2. **Reversal:**
   - `asc.reverse()` reverses `asc` in-place. Since `asc` is empty, reversing it has no effect. `asc` remains `[]`.

3. **Slicing:**
   - `desc = asc[:len(asc) // 2]` assigns the first half of `asc` to `desc`. Since `asc` is empty, `len(asc)` is 0, and `len(asc) // 2` is also 0. Thus, `desc` becomes an empty list `[]`.

4. **Concatenation:**
   - The function returns `desc + asc + desc`. This is equivalent to concatenating three empty lists: `[] + [] + []`. The result is an empty list `[]`.
