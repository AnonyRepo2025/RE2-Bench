Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given inputs.

1. **Initial values:**
   - `text = "0 t 1cos "`
   - `froms = "st 0\t\n  "`

2. **`text.lstrip(froms)`:**
   The `lstrip()` method removes leading characters from `text` that are present in `froms`.
   - `froms` contains " ", "0", "s", "t", "\t", and "\n".
   - The leading characters "0", " ", "\t" are removed from `text`.
   - `text` becomes "t 1cos ".

3. **`text.rstrip(froms)`:**
   The `rstrip()` method removes trailing characters from `text` that are present in `froms`.
   - The trailing character " " is removed from `text`.
   - `text` becomes "t 1cos".

4. **Return:**
   The function returns the modified `text`, which is "t 1cos".
