The function `f` iterates through the input string `text` character by character. If a character is a digit, it's kept as is; otherwise, it's replaced by an asterisk '*'.

1. **Input:** "5f83u23saa"

2. **Iteration 1:** '5' is a digit. `new_text` becomes ['5']
3. **Iteration 2:** 'f' is not a digit. `new_text` becomes ['5', '*']
4. **Iteration 3:** '8' is a digit. `new_text` becomes ['5', '*', '8']
5. **Iteration 4:** '3' is a digit. `new_text` becomes ['5', '*', '8', '3']
6. **Iteration 5:** 'u' is not a digit. `new_text` becomes ['5', '*', '8', '3', '*']
7. **Iteration 6:** '2' is a digit. `new_text` becomes ['5', '*', '8', '3', '*', '2']
8. **Iteration 7:** '3' is a digit. `new_text` becomes ['5', '*', '8', '3', '*', '2', '3']
9. **Iteration 8:** 's' is not a digit. `new_text` becomes ['5', '*', '8', '3', '*', '2', '3', '*']
10. **Iteration 9:** 'a' is not a digit. `new_text` becomes ['5', '*', '8', '3', '*', '2', '3', '*', '*']
11. **Iteration 10:** 'a' is not a digit. `new_text` becomes ['5', '*', '8', '3', '*', '2', '3', '*', '*', '*']

Finally, ''.join(new_text) concatenates the list elements into a single string: "5*83*23***".
