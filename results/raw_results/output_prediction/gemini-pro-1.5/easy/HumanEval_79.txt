The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `decimal` as input and returns a string representing the binary equivalent of the decimal number, prefixed and suffixed with "db".

1. The input decimal is 103.
2. `bin(103)` converts 103 to its binary representation, which is '0b1100111'.
3. `bin(103)[2:]` slices the string from the 3rd character onwards, removing the "0b" prefix. This results in '1100111'.
4. 'db' is prepended and appended to the binary string, resulting in 'db1100111db'.
