Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Initial values:**
   - `num = "1"`
   - `l = 3`
   - `t = ""`

2. **Loop 1:**
   - `l` (3) > `len(num)` (1) is true.
   - `t += "0"`  `t` becomes "0"
   - `l -= 1`  `l` becomes 2

3. **Loop 2:**
   - `l` (2) > `len(num)` (1) is true.
   - `t += "0"`  `t` becomes "00"
   - `l -= 1`  `l` becomes 1

4. **Loop 3:**
   - `l` (1) > `len(num)` (1) is false. The loop terminates.

5. **Return:**
   - The function returns `t + num`, which is "00" + "1" = "001".
