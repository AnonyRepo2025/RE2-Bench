The `write_excel` function takes a list of lists (representing rows of data) and a file name as input. It creates an Excel file with the given name and writes the data to it.

The function uses the `openpyxl` library to create and manipulate Excel files.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Create Workbook and Sheet:**
   - `workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()` creates a new Excel workbook.
   - `sheet = workbook.active` gets the currently active sheet in the workbook.

2. **Iterate through Data:**
   - The code iterates through each row in the `data` list: `for row in data:`

3. **Append Rows to Sheet:**
   - Inside the loop, `sheet.append(row)` adds each row to the active sheet.

4. **Save and Close Workbook:**
   - `workbook.save(file_name)` saves the workbook to the specified file name ("test_data_process.xlsx").
   - `workbook.close()` closes the workbook.

5. **Return 1 on Success:**
   - If the process completes without any errors, the function returns 1.

6. **Return 0 on Failure:**
   - If any exception occurs during the process (e.g., file write error), the function returns 0.

In this case, the provided data is a list of lists representing rows of data with headers. The function will create an Excel file named "test_data_process.xlsx" and write the data to it. Since the input is valid and no errors are expected, the function will return 1.
