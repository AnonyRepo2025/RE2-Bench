Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the input "99".

1. **Loop 1:** The first character `c` is '9'. `'9'.isnumeric()` returns `True`. The `if` condition is `not True`, which is `False`. So, the code inside the `if` block is skipped.
2. **Loop 2:** The second character `c` is '9'. `'9'.isnumeric()` returns `True`. The `if` condition is `not True`, which is `False`. So, the code inside the `if` block is skipped.
3. **After the loop:** The loop completes without returning `False`. The function reaches the line `return bool(text)`. Since `text` is "99", which is a non-empty string, `bool("99")` evaluates to `True`.

Therefore, the function returns `True`.
