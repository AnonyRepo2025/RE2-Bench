The `rindex()` method returns the highest index in the string where the substring sub is found, such that sub is contained within s[start:end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. It raises ValueError when the substring sub is not found.

In our case, the string is "breakfast" and the character we are looking for is "e".
"breakfast" has two "e" characters. The first "e" is at index 1 and the second "e" is at index 2.
The `rindex()` method will return the index of the last occurrence of "e", which is 2.
