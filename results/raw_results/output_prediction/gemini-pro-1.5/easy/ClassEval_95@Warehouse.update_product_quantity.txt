Initially, `self.inventory` is `{"1": {"name": "product 3", "quantity": 9}}`.
The function `update_product_quantity` takes `product_id` as 1 and `quantity` as -1.
Inside the function, the code checks if `product_id` is in `self.inventory`.
Since 1 is a key in `self.inventory` (although as a string "1"), the code enters the `if` block.
The quantity of the product with id "1" is updated as follows:
`self.inventory["1"]['quantity'] += quantity`
`self.inventory["1"]['quantity'] += -1`
So, the quantity becomes 9 + (-1) = 8.
The function doesn't return anything explicitly, so it implicitly returns `None`.
