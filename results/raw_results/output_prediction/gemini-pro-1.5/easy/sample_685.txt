The function `f` takes an array and an element as input. It returns the number of times the element appears in the array plus the element itself.

In this case, the array is `[1, 1, 1]` and the element is `-2`.

The element `-2` appears 0 times in the array.

Therefore, the function returns 0 + (-2) = -2.
