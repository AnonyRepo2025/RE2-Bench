Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given inputs.

1. **Input:** `text` is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2", and `chars` is "0123456789-".

2. **Conditional Check:** Since `chars` is not empty, the code inside the `if` block is executed.

3. **rstrip():** `text.rstrip(chars)` removes any trailing characters that are present in the `chars` string. In this case, the trailing characters are " - " (a space, a hyphen, and another space). The hyphen and the spaces are present in `chars`, so they are removed. The resulting `text` becomes "new-medium-performing-application".

4. **Conditional Check:** The updated `text` is not empty.

5. **Return:** The function returns the modified `text`.
