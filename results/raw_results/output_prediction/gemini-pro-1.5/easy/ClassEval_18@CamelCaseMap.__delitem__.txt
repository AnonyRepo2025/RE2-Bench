Here's how `__delitem__` will execute:

1. **`__delitem__(self, key="first_name")` is called.**
2. **Inside `__delitem__`, `del self._data[self._convert_key(key)]` is executed.** This attempts to delete the entry in `self._data` with the key returned by `self._convert_key("first_name")`.
3. **`self._convert_key("first_name")` is called.**
4. **Inside `_convert_key`, `isinstance(key, str)` evaluates to `True`.**
5. **`self._to_camel_case("first_name")` is called.** Although the implementation of `_to_camel_case` isn't provided, its name suggests it converts snake_case to camelCase.  Therefore, we can assume it will return "firstName".
6. **Back in `__delitem__`, `del self._data["firstName"]` is executed.** Since `self._data` is an empty dictionary, this will raise a `KeyError`.
