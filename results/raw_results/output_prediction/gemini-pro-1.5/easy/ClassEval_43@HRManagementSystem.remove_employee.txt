The `remove_employee` method checks if the given `employee_id` exists as a key in the `self.employees` dictionary. In this case, `employee_id` is 2, and the dictionary contains only the key "1". Since 2 is not in the dictionary, the `if` condition is false, the `else` block is executed, and the method returns `False`.
