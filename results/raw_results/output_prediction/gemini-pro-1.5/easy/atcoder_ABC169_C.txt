Let's trace the execution with the given input "1 0.01":

1. `a, b = input().split()` splits the input string into two parts based on spaces. So, `a` becomes "1" and `b` becomes "0.01".

2. `b = b[0] + b[2:]` takes the first character of `b` (which is "0") and concatenates it with the characters of `b` starting from the third character (which is an empty string since `b` has only three characters). So, `b` becomes "0".

3. `a = int(a)` converts `a` to an integer. So, `a` becomes 1.

4. `b = int(b)` converts `b` to an integer. So, `b` becomes 0.

5. `print(a * b // 100)` calculates `1 * 0 // 100`. This simplifies to `0 // 100`, which is 0.

Therefore, the output is 0.
