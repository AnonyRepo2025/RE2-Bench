The `list_employees` method iterates through the `self.employees` dictionary and constructs a new dictionary `employee_data` with the same structure, but adds an `employee_ID` key to each employee's information.

In this case, `self.employees` has one entry with key "1" and the corresponding employee information. The loop will iterate once, and the following will happen:

1. `employee_id` will be "1".
2. `employee_info` will be the dictionary `{"name": "John", "position": "Manager", "department": "Sales", "salary": 100000}`.
3. `employee_details` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
4. `employee_details['employee_ID'] = employee_id` adds the key "employee_ID" with value "1" to `employee_details`.
5. The inner loop iterates through the `employee_info` dictionary:
   - `key` and `value` take on the following pairs:
     - "name", "John"
     - "position", "Manager"
     - "department", "Sales"
     - "salary", 100000
   - For each pair, `employee_details[key] = value` adds the key-value pair to `employee_details`.
6. Finally, `employee_data[employee_id] = employee_details` adds the `employee_details` dictionary to `employee_data` with the key "1".

Therefore, the final `employee_data` dictionary will be:

```
{
    "1": {
        "employee_ID": "1",
        "name": "John",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 100000
    }
}
```

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "1": {
        "employee_ID": "1",
        "name": "John",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 100000
    }
}
```
