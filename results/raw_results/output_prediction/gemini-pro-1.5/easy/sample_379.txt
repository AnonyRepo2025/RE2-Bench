Let's trace the execution of the function `f(nums)` with `nums = []`.

1. **`for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -3):`**:
   - `len(nums)` is 0.
   - `len(nums) - 1` is -1.
   - The `range` function with arguments `(start=-1, stop=-1, step=-3)` will not execute any iterations. The loop condition is checked before each iteration. Since the start value (-1) is already less than the stop value (-1) when using a negative step, the loop terminates immediately.

2. Since the loop doesn't execute, the `if nums[i] == 0:` condition is never checked, and `nums.clear()` is never called.

3. The function returns the original `nums` list, which is `[]`.
