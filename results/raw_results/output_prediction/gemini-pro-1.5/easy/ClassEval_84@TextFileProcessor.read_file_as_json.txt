The `read_file_as_json` method attempts to open the file specified by `file_path`, which is "test_2.txt", and parse its contents as JSON.  We don't have the contents of "test_2.txt", so we can't determine the exact output.  We need the content of the file to provide the output.

Assuming "test_2.txt" contains:

```json
{"key1": "value1", "key2": 123}
```

Then the output would be:

```json
{"output": {"key1": "value1", "key2": 123}}
```

Assuming "test_2.txt" contains invalid JSON, like:

```
This is not valid JSON
```

Then a `json.JSONDecodeError` would be raised.


Since we don't have the file content, I'll assume a valid JSON file with the following content:

```json
{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```
[/THOUGHT]

[OUTPUT]
```json
{
    "output": {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
