Let's trace the execution of the function `f(s, p)` with `s = "qqqqq"` and `p = "qqq"`.

1. **`arr = s.partition(p)`**: This partitions the string `s` into three parts based on the separator `p`.
   - `arr[0]` will be the part of `s` before the first occurrence of `p`. In this case, it's an empty string "".
   - `arr[1]` will be the separator `p` itself, which is "qqq".
   - `arr[2]` will be the part of `s` after the first occurrence of `p`. In this case, it's "qq".

2. **`part_one, part_two, part_three = (len(arr[0]), len(arr[1]), len(arr[2]))`**: This calculates the lengths of the three parts.
   - `part_one = len("") = 0`
   - `part_two = len("qqq") = 3`
   - `part_three = len("qq") = 2`

3. **`if part_one >= 2 and part_two <= 2 and part_three >= 2`**: This condition checks if `part_one` is greater than or equal to 2, `part_two` is less than or equal to 2, and `part_three` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - The condition evaluates to `0 >= 2 and 3 <= 2 and 2 >= 2`, which simplifies to `False and False and True`, resulting in `False`.

4. Since the condition is false, the `else` block is executed, which returns `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]`.
   - This is equivalent to "" + "qqq" + "qq", which results in "qqqqq".

Therefore, the function will return "qqqqq".
