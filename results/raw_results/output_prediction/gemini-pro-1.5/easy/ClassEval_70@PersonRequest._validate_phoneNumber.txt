The `_validate_phoneNumber` method checks if the provided phone number is valid.

1. It checks if the `phoneNumber` is empty. If it is, it returns `None`.
2. It checks if the length of the `phoneNumber` is 11 and if it contains only digits. If either of these conditions is false, it returns `None`.
3. If both conditions are true, it returns the `phoneNumber`.

In this case, the input `phoneNumber` is "jgdjrj".

- The `phoneNumber` is not empty.
- The length of the `phoneNumber` is 6, which is not equal to 11.
- The `phoneNumber` does not contain only digits.

Therefore, the method will return `None`.
