The `splitlines()` method splits a string into a list of strings, using newline characters as delimiters. Let's trace the execution:

1. `text = "145\n\n12fjkjg"`
2. `s = text.splitlines()` splits the string into a list of strings: `s = ["145", "", "12fjkjg"]`.
3. `len(s)` returns the number of elements in the list `s`, which is 3.
