The function `f` takes a dictionary `student_marks` and a string `name` as input. It checks if the given `name` exists as a key in the `student_marks` dictionary.

1. **Input:**
   - `student_marks` is `{"882afmfp": 56}`.
   - `name` is `"6f53p"`.

2. **Execution:**
   - The code checks if `"6f53p"` is a key in `{"882afmfp": 56}`.
   - Since `"6f53p"` is not a key in the dictionary, the condition `name in student_marks` evaluates to `False`.
   - The code then executes the `return 'Name unknown'` statement.

Therefore, the output will be "Name unknown".
