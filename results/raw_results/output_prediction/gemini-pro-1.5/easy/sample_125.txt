Here's how the function `f` executes with the given input:

1. **Initial values:**
   - `text` = "\"Leap and the net will appear"
   - `res` = 123

2. **Loop 1: `c = '*'`**
   - `text` = "\"Leap and the net will appear" (no change as '*' is not present)

3. **Loop 2: `c = '\n'`**
   - `text` = "\"Leap and the net will appear" (no change as '\n' is not present)

4. **Loop 3: `c = '"'`**
   - `text` = "!123Leap and the net will appear" (double quote at the beginning is replaced)

5. **`startswith('!')` check:**
   - The condition `text.startswith('!')` is true.

6. **Substring removal:**
   - `text` = "Leap and the net will appear" (the "!123" at the beginning is removed because `len(str(res))` which is `len(str(123))` is 3, and we remove the first 3+1=4 characters)

7. **Return:**
   - The function returns "Leap and the net will appear".
