The function `f` reverses the input string `text`.

1. The input string is "was,".
2. The code iterates through the string from the last character to the first.
3. In each iteration, it appends the current character to the `result` string.
4. The loop runs for indices 3, 2, 1, and 0.
5. The characters are appended in the following order: ',', 's', 'a', 'w'.
6. The final reversed string is ",saw".
