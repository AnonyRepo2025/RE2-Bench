The `insert_into_database` method inserts data into a specified table in the SQLite database. Let's trace its execution:

1. **Connection and Cursor:** It establishes a connection to the database "test.db" and creates a cursor object.
2. **Looping through Data:** The code iterates through the provided `data` list, which contains two dictionaries, one for John and one for Alice.
3. **Insert Query:** Inside the loop, it constructs an SQL INSERT query.  For John, the query will be: `INSERT INTO test_table (name, age) VALUES ('John', 25)` and for Alice: `INSERT INTO test_table (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 30)`.
4. **Execution:** The `cursor.execute()` method executes the generated SQL query, inserting the data into the "test_table".
5. **Commit and Close:** After inserting both records, `conn.commit()` saves the changes to the database, and `conn.close()` closes the connection.

The function doesn't return any value explicitly, so it implicitly returns `None`.
