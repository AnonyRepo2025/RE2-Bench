Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given inputs.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `arr` is initialized to `["b", "vzjmc", "f", "ae", "0"]`.
   - `d` is initialized to `{"vzjmc": "b", "ae": "f"}`.

2. **Loop 1:**
   - `i = 1`
   - `d.update({arr[1]: arr[0]})` which translates to `d.update({"vzjmc": "b"})`. Since the key "vzjmc" already exists in `d` with the value "b", this update doesn't change the dictionary.

3. **Loop 2:**
   - `i = 3`
   - `d.update({arr[3]: arr[2]})` which translates to `d.update({"ae": "f"})`. Similar to the previous step, the key "ae" already exists with the value "f", so this update also doesn't change the dictionary.

4. **Return:**
   - The function returns the dictionary `d`, which remains unchanged after the loop.

Therefore, the final state of the dictionary `d` is `{"vzjmc": "b", "ae": "f"}`.
