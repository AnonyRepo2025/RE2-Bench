The `mean` function calculates the average of the numbers in the input list `data`.

1. The sum of the numbers in `data` is 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 25.
2. The length of `data` is 6.
3. The average is 25 / 6 = 4.166666...
4. The `round` function rounds the average to two decimal places, which is 4.17.
