Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Initial values:**
   - `text` = "uzlwaqiaj"
   - `char` = "u"

2. **`char in text` check:**
   - 'u' is present in "uzlwaqiaj", so the `if` condition is met.

3. **`partition(char)`:**
   - `text.partition('u')` splits the string into three parts:
     - `suff` = ""
     - `char` = "u"
     - `pref` = "zlwaqiaj"

4. **`pref` recalculation:**
   - `suff[:-len(char)]` evaluates to "", as `suff` is empty.
   - `suff[len(char):]` also evaluates to "", as `suff` is empty.
   - Therefore, `pref` becomes "" + "" + "u" + "zlwaqiaj" = "uzlwaqiaj"

5. **Return value:**
   - The function returns `suff + char + pref`, which is "" + "u" + "uzlwaqiaj" = "uuzlwaqiaj"
