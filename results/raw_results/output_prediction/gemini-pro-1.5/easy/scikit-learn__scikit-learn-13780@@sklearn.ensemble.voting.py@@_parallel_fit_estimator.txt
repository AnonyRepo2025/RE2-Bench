1. The `_parallel_fit_estimator` function takes an estimator, X, y, and optionally sample_weight as input. In this case, sample_weight is None.
2. The function then calls `estimator.fit(X, y)`.
3. The estimator is a `LogisticRegression` object with the specified parameters.
4. The `solver` parameter is 'warn', which defaults to 'liblinear'.
5. The `multi_class` parameter is 'warn', which defaults to 'ovr' since the solver is 'liblinear'.
6. The `fit` method of `LogisticRegression` is called with X and y.
7. `check_X_y` converts X and y to numpy arrays. X becomes a 2D array of shape (150, 2) and y becomes a 1D array of shape (150,).
8. `_fit_liblinear` is called since the solver is 'liblinear'. This function trains the logistic regression model and returns the coefficients, intercept, and number of iterations.
