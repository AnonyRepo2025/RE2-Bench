Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given inputs.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `list` is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`
   - `operation` is a lambda function (not explicitly defined, but we'll assume it modifies the list in-place).
2. **Copying the list:**
   - `new_list = list[:]` creates a *copy* of the original list. So, `new_list` becomes `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.  This is important because modifications to `new_list` will not affect the original `list`.
3. **Sorting the copy:**
   - `new_list.sort()` sorts `new_list` in-place. `new_list` becomes `[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`.
4. **Applying the operation:**
   - `operation(new_list)` calls the lambda function with `new_list` as an argument. Since the lambda function is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to `new_list`. However, it's crucial to understand that this operation modifies `new_list`, not the original `list`.
5. **Returning the original list:**
   - The function returns the original `list`, which remains unchanged throughout the process.

Therefore, the output will be the original, unsorted list.
