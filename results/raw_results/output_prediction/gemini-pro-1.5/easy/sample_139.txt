Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Length Check:** The function first checks if the length of both `first` and `second` is less than 10. In this case, `len(first)` is 3 and `len(second)` is 3. Both are less than 10.
2. **Return 'no':** Since the condition in the `if` statement is met (at least one list has length less than 10), the function immediately returns 'no'.
