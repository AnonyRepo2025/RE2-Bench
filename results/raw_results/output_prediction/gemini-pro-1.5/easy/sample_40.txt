The `ljust` function pads the string on the right with a given character (in this case, '#') until it reaches a specified length. The specified length here is `len(text) + 1`.

The input string `text` is "the cow goes moo". Its length is 16. Therefore, the `ljust` function will pad the string with '#' until it reaches a length of 16 + 1 = 17. Since the string already has a length of 16, only one '#' will be added at the end.

{
    "output": "the cow goes moo#"        
}
