The `isascii()` method checks if all characters in a string are ASCII characters. ASCII characters have code points in the range 0-127.

The input string "wW\uc758IV]HDJjhgK[dGIUlVO@Ess$coZkBqu[Ct" contains the character '\uc758'. This character represents "Ïùò" in Unicode (Hangul Syllables), and its code point is outside the ASCII range. Therefore, the `isascii()` method will return False.
