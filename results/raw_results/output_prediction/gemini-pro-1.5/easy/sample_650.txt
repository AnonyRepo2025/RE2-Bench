Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Initial values:**
   - `string` = ""
   - `substring` = "A"

2. **Loop condition:** `string.startswith(substring)`
   - The empty string "" does not start with "A". So, the loop condition is false, and the loop body is not executed.

3. **Return:** The function returns the original value of `string`, which is "".
