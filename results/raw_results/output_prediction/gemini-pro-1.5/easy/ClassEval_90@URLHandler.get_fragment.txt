The `get_fragment` method searches for the '#' character in the URL and returns the part of the URL after it.

1. The URL is "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#aaa".
2. `self.url.find('#')` will return the index of '#', which is 46.
3. `fragment_start` will be 46.
4. The condition `fragment_start != -1` is true.
5. The method returns `self.url[fragment_start + 1:]`, which is the substring starting from index 47.
6. The substring from index 47 is "aaa".

Therefore, the output will be "aaa".
