Let's trace the execution of the `extract_file` method with the given inputs.

1. **Initialization:** A `ZipFileProcessor` object is created with `self.file_name` set to "example.zip".

2. **`extract_file` call:** The `extract_file` method is called with `file_name` as "example5.txt" and `output_path` as "output_directory".

3. **Inside `extract_file`:**
   - It attempts to open "example.zip" in read mode (`'r'`).
   - If the file exists and is a valid zip file, it proceeds. Otherwise, it goes to the `except` block.
   - **`zip_file.extract(file_name, output_path)`:** This attempts to extract a file named "example5.txt" from the zip archive to the "output_directory".  If "example5.txt" exists within the zip file, it will be extracted. If not, an exception (specifically `KeyError`) will be raised, causing the code to jump to the `except` block.
   - If the extraction is successful, the method returns `True`.
   - If any exception occurs during the process (e.g., the zip file doesn't exist, the file to extract isn't found, or there's a problem writing to the output directory), the `except` block is executed, and the method returns `False`.

Since the problem description doesn't specify the contents of "example.zip", we have to consider two cases:

**Case 1: "example.zip" contains "example5.txt"**
In this case, the extraction will be successful, and the function will return `True`.

**Case 2: "example.zip" does not contain "example5.txt"**
In this case, a `KeyError` will be raised during the `extract` call, and the function will return `False`.

Since we don't have information about the zip file's contents, we'll assume the general case where the file might not exist and return `False`.
