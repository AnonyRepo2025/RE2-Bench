Here's how we determine the output:

1. **`sublist = text[s:e]`**: This line extracts a sublist from the input `text`. In our case, `text` is "happy", `s` is 0, and `e` is 3. So, `sublist` becomes "hap".

2. **`if not sublist:`**: This condition checks if the `sublist` is empty.  Since `sublist` is "hap", this condition is false, and we move to the next line.

3. **`return sublist.index(min(sublist))`**: This line finds the minimum character in `sublist` and returns its index.
   - `min(sublist)`: The minimum character in "hap" is 'a'.
   - `sublist.index('a')`: The index of 'a' in "hap" is 1.

Therefore, the function returns 1.
