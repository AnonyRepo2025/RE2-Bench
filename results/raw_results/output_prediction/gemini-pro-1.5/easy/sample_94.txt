The function `f(a, b)` merges two dictionaries `a` and `b`. If there are common keys, the values from dictionary `b` will overwrite the values from dictionary `a`.

In this case, `a` is `{"w": 5, "wi": 10}` and `b` is `{"w": 3}`.

The result of merging these two dictionaries will be `{"w": 3, "wi": 10}`. The value of "w" is overwritten by the value in `b`, while "wi" remains unchanged.

{
    "w": 3,
    "wi": 10
