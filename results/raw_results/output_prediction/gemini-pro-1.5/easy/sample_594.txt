The function `f` takes a string `file` as input and returns the index of the first newline character (`\n`) in the string.

The input string is "n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n.\n".
The first newline character appears at the end of the string.

Let's count the characters before the newline:
"n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n." has 33 characters.

Therefore, the index of the first newline character is 33.
