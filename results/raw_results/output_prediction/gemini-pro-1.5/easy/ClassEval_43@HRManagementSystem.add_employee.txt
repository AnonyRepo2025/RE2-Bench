Initially, `self.employees` is `{"1": {"name": "John Doe", "position": "Manager", "department": "HR", "salary": 5000}}`.
The `add_employee` function checks if the given `employee_id` is already present in `self.employees`.
In this case, `employee_id` is 1. Since `"1"` is a key in `self.employees`, the condition `employee_id in self.employees` evaluates to `True`.
Therefore, the function returns `False`.
