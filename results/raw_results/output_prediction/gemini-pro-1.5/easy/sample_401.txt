Here's how the code executes with the given input:

1. **`if suffix and text.endswith(suffix):`**: This condition checks two things:
   - **`suffix`**:  `suffix` is "example", which evaluates to `True` in a boolean context (since it's a non-empty string).
   - **`text.endswith(suffix)`**: `text` is "mathematics".  "mathematics" does *not* end with "example". So, this part of the condition is `False`.

2. Since the combined condition (`True and False`) is `False`, the code inside the `if` block is skipped.

3. **`return text`**: The function returns the original `text` unchanged.

Therefore, the output will be "mathematics".
