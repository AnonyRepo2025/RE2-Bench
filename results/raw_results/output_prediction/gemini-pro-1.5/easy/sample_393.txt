Here's how the code executes with the input "scala":

1. **Reverse the string:** `ls = text[::-1]` becomes `ls = "alacs"`.

2. **Initialize an empty string:** `text2 = ''`

3. **Loop through the reversed string:** The loop `for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3)` iterates as follows:
   - `len(ls)` is 5.
   - `len(ls) - 3` is 2.
   - The loop goes from 2 down to (but not including) 0, with a step of -3.
   - So, the loop runs only once with `i = 2`.

4. **Inside the loop:**
   - `ls[i:i + 3]` becomes `ls[2:5]`, which is `"acs"`.
   - `'---'.join("acs")` becomes `"a---c---s"`.
   - `text2 += '---'.join(ls[i:i + 3]) + '---'` becomes `text2 += "a---c---s---"`.

5. **Return the result:**
   - `return text2[:-3]` removes the last three characters ("---"), resulting in `"a---c---s"`.
