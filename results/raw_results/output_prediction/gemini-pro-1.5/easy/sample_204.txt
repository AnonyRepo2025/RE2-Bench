Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given input.

1. The input `name` is "master. ".

2. `name[0]` accesses the first character of the string, which is 'm'.

3. `name[1]` accesses the second character of the string, which is 'a'.

4. `name[1][::-1]` reverses the substring `name[1]`, which is just 'a' in this case, so the reversed string is still 'a'.

5. `name[1][::-1][0]` accesses the first character of the reversed string, which is 'a'.

6. The function returns a list containing 'm' and 'a'.
