Let's trace the execution of the `add` function with the given input `lst = [4, 4, 6, 8]`.

The function calculates the sum of even-indexed elements (starting from index 1) that are even.

1. **Initialization:** `sum = 0` (implicitly)
2. **Loop 1:**
   - `i = 1`
   - `lst[1] = 4`
   - `lst[1] % 2 == 0` is true (4 is even)
   - `sum += 4` (sum becomes 4)
3. **Loop 2:**
   - `i = 3`
   - `lst[3] = 8`
   - `lst[3] % 2 == 0` is true (8 is even)
   - `sum += 8` (sum becomes 12)

Therefore, the function returns 12.
