Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Initial values:**
   - n = "x"
   - m = "$"
   - text = "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"

2. **Condition Check:** `text.strip()` is not empty, so the code inside the `if` block is skipped.

3. **String Splitting:**
   - head = "2"
   - mid = "xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri"
   - tail = "s"

4. **Replacements and Joining:**
   - `head.replace(n, m)`: "2" (no "x" to replace)
   - `mid.replace(n, m)`: "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri" (replaces "x" with "$")
   - `tail.replace(n, m)`: "s" (no "x" to replace)
   - `joined`: "2" + "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri" + "s" = "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"

5. **Return:** The function returns the `joined` string.
