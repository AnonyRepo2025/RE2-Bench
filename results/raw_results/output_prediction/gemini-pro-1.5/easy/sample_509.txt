Here's how the execution flows:

1. **value = 5** and **width = 1** are extracted from the input.
2. The first condition `value >= 0` is met (5 >= 0).
3. Inside the `if` block, `str(value)` converts the integer 5 to the string "5".
4. `.zfill(width)` pads the string with leading zeros until it reaches the specified width. In this case, width is 1, and the string "5" already has a length of 1, so no padding is added.
5. The function returns "5".
