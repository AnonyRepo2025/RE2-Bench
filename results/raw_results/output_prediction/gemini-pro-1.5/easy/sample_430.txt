Let's trace the execution of the function `f(arr1, arr2)` with the given inputs.

1. `new_arr = arr1.copy()`: This creates a new list `new_arr` which is a copy of `arr1`. So, `new_arr` initially contains `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]`.

2. `new_arr.extend(arr2)`: This extends `new_arr` by appending all the elements of `arr2` to it.  `arr2` is `["", 0, -1, []]`.

Therefore, the final `new_arr` will be `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.

The function returns `new_arr`.
