The function `f` searches for the `target` element within the `items` list. If found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of the `target`. Otherwise, it returns -1.

In this case, `items` is `["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]` and `target` is `"**"`.

The `target` "**" is present in the `items` list at index 3.
