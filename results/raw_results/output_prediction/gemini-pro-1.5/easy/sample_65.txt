Here's how the execution flows:

1. **nums[index] % 42:** `nums[index]` accesses the element at the given `index`. In this case, `index` is 3, so `nums[3]` is 7. Then, `7 % 42` is calculated, which results in 7.

2. **nums.pop(index):** The `pop()` method removes the element at the specified `index` and returns it. So, `nums.pop(3)` removes 7 from the list and returns it. The `nums` list is now `[3, 2, 0]`.

3. **... * 2:** The popped value (7) is then multiplied by 2, resulting in 14.

4. **... + ...:** Finally, the result of the modulo operation (7) is added to the result of the multiplication (14), giving us 7 + 14 = 21.
