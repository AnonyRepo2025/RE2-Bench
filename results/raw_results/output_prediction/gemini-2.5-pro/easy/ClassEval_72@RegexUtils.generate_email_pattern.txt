[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to predict the output of the `generate_email_pattern` method from the `RegexUtils` class.

2.  **Examine the Input:** The input specifies that the method is called on an instance of `RegexUtils` with no arguments.
    *   `self`: An instance of `RegexUtils`.
    *   `args`: Empty dictionary, meaning no positional arguments are passed.
    *   `kwargs`: Empty dictionary, meaning no keyword arguments are passed.

3.  **Step-by-Step Execution of `generate_email_pattern`:**
    *   The method is called.
    *   Inside the method, a local variable `pattern` is created.
    *   It is assigned the literal string value: `'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`.
    *   The method does not perform any calculations or modifications. It doesn't use `self` or any input arguments.
    *   The `return` statement is executed, which returns the value of the `pattern` variable.

4.  **Determine the Final Output:** The function will return the string it defined internally. The returned value is `'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`.

5.  **Format the Output:** I need to place this string into the `XXX` placeholder in the provided JSON structure. The backslashes in the Python string literal are already escaped, so they will be represented correctly in the final JSON string.
