Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` with the given input.

1.  **Function Call**: The function `f` is called with the dictionary `dct = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}`.

2.  **Initialization**: Inside the function, an empty list `lst` is created: `lst = []`.

3.  **Looping**: The code enters a `for` loop: `for key in sorted(dct):`.
    *   `dct` is `{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}`.
    *   `sorted(dct)` sorts the keys of the dictionary. The keys are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. When sorted alphabetically, they become `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
    *   The loop will iterate three times, with the `key` variable taking the values 'a', 'b', and 'c' in that order.

4.  **First Iteration (key = 'a')**:
    *   The line `lst.append((key, dct[key]))` is executed.
    *   `key` is 'a'.
    *   `dct[key]` is `dct['a']`, which is `1`.
    *   A tuple `('a', 1)` is created.
    *   This tuple is appended to `lst`. `lst` is now `[('a', 1)]`.

5.  **Second Iteration (key = 'b')**:
    *   The line `lst.append((key, dct[key]))` is executed again.
    *   `key` is 'b'.
    *   `dct[key]` is `dct['b']`, which is `2`.
    *   A tuple `('b', 2)` is created.
    *   This tuple is appended to `lst`. `lst` is now `[('a', 1), ('b', 2)]`.

6.  **Third Iteration (key = 'c')**:
    *   The line `lst.append((key, dct[key]))` is executed for the last time.
    *   `key` is 'c'.
    *   `dct[key]` is `dct['c']`, which is `3`.
    *   A tuple `('c', 3)` is created.
    *   This tuple is appended to `lst`. `lst` is now `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`.

7.  **End of Loop**: The loop finishes as there are no more keys to iterate over.

8.  **Return Value**: The function returns the final value of `lst`, which is `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`.

9.  **JSON Formatting**: The output needs to be in JSON format. A Python list of tuples is represented as a JSON array of arrays.
    *   `('a', 1)` becomes `["a", 1]`
    *   `('b', 2)` becomes `["b", 2]`
    *   `('c', 3)` becomes `["c", 3]`
    *   The entire list becomes `[["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]`.

Therefore, the final output will be `[["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]`.
