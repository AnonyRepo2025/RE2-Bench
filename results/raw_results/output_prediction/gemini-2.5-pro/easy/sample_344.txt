[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` step by step.

1.  **Function Definition**:
    ```python
    def f(list, operation):
        new_list = list[:]
        new_list.sort()
        operation(new_list)
        return list
    ```

2.  **Function Call**:
    The function `f` is called with two arguments:
    - `list`: `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`
    - `operation`: A lambda function. The specific action of this lambda is not provided, but we will see that it doesn't affect the final result.

3.  **Inside the function `f`**:
    - **`new_list = list[:]`**: This line creates a *shallow copy* of the input `list`.
        - The original `list` is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
        - `new_list` becomes a new list object with the same elements: `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
        - Crucially, `new_list` and `list` are now two separate objects in memory. Modifying one will not affect the other.

    - **`new_list.sort()`**: This method sorts the `new_list` *in-place*.
        - `new_list` was `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
        - After sorting, `new_list` becomes `[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`.
        - The original `list` remains unchanged: `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.

    - **`operation(new_list)`**: The `operation` (the lambda function) is called with the sorted `new_list` (`[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`) as its argument.
        - Whatever this lambda function does (e.g., modify the list, print it, etc.), it operates on `new_list`.
        - Since `new_list` is a separate copy, any modifications made by the `operation` will *not* affect the original `list`.

    - **`return list`**: The function returns the value of the `list` variable. This is the original, unmodified list that was passed into the function.

4.  **Final Output**:
    The value returned is the original `list`, which is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
