[THOUGHT]
1.  The user wants me to predict the output of the `__len__` method of the `CamelCaseMap` class.
2.  The `__len__` method is defined as `return len(self._data)`.
3.  The input provides the state of the `self` object.
4.  In the input, `self._data` is `{"firstName": "John"}`.
5.  The `len()` function, when called on a dictionary, returns the number of key-value pairs.
6.  The dictionary `{"firstName": "John"}` has one key-value pair.
7.  Therefore, `len(self._data)` will evaluate to `len({"firstName": "John"})`, which is `1`.
8.  The function will return `1`.
9.  I will place this value into the provided JSON structure.
