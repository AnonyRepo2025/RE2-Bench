[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `write_excel` method.

1.  **Function:** `ExcelProcessor.write_excel`
2.  **Inputs:**
    *   `self`: An instance of `ExcelProcessor`. The `__init__` is empty, so no state is involved.
    *   `data`: A list of lists containing strings and integers. This is a valid format for `openpyxl`.
    *   `file_name`: A string `"test_data_process.xlsx"`. This is a valid file name.
3.  **Execution Analysis:**
    *   The method is wrapped in a `try...except` block. It returns `1` on success and `0` on failure.
    *   `workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()`: This creates a new, empty workbook in memory. This operation should succeed.
    *   `sheet = workbook.active`: This gets the default active sheet. This should succeed.
    *   `for row in data:`: The code iterates through the input `data`.
        *   `sheet.append(row)`: For each sublist (`row`) in `data`, this method appends it as a new row to the worksheet. The `openpyxl` library can handle mixed data types like strings and integers in a row. All the provided rows are valid. This loop will execute without error.
    *   `workbook.save(file_name)`: This attempts to save the workbook to the file `"test_data_process.xlsx"`. Assuming the environment has write permissions to the current directory, this operation will succeed.
    *   `workbook.close()`: This closes the workbook object, releasing resources. This will succeed.
    *   `return 1`: Since no exceptions were raised during the process, the `try` block completes successfully, and the function returns `1`.
4.  **Conclusion:** The function will execute all steps within the `try` block without raising an exception. Therefore, it will return the value `1`.
