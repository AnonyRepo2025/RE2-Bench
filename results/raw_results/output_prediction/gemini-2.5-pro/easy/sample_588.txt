[THOUGHT]
1.  The function `f` is called with `items = ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]` and `target = "**"`.
2.  The first line of the function is an `if` statement: `if target in items:`.
3.  This checks if the value of `target`, which is `"**"`, is present in the list `items`.
4.  Looking at the `items` list: `["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]`. The element `"**"` is indeed in the list.
5.  Therefore, the condition `target in items` evaluates to `True`.
6.  The code inside the `if` block is executed: `return items.index(target)`.
7.  The `list.index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value.
8.  We need to find the index of `"**"` in `["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]`.
9.  The indices are as follows:
    - `items[0]` is `"1"`
    - `items[1]` is `"+"`
    - `items[2]` is `"-"`
    - `items[3]` is `"**"`
10. The `index()` method finds `"**"` at index `3`.
11. The function returns the value `3`.
12. The `return -1` statement is not reached.
13. The final output will be `3`.
