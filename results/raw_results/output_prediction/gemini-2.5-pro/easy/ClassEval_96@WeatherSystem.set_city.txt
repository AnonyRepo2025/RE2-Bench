[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the function:** The user wants me to predict the output of the `set_city` method in the `WeatherSystem` class.
2.  **Function signature:** `def set_city(self, city):`. It takes `self` (the instance of the class) and a `city` string as arguments.
3.  **Function body:** The only line of code inside the method is `self.city = city`. This line updates the `city` attribute of the `self` instance to the new value passed in the `city` argument.
4.  **Return value:** The function does not have an explicit `return` statement. In Python, functions that don't explicitly return a value implicitly return `None`.
5.  **Analyze the input:**
    *   `self`: An instance of `WeatherSystem` with `self.city` initially set to `"New York"`.
    *   `args`: The positional arguments. The `city` argument is provided with the value `"Beijing"`.
6.  **Simulate execution:**
    *   The `set_city` method is called on the provided `self` instance.
    *   The `city` parameter inside the method is assigned the value `"Beijing"`.
    *   The line `self.city = city` is executed. The instance's `city` attribute is changed from `"New York"` to `"Beijing"`.
    *   The method finishes.
    *   Since there's no `return` statement, the method returns `None`.
7.  **Format the output:**
    *   The required output structure is `{"output": XXX}`.
    *   The return value is `None`.
    *   In JSON, `None` is represented as `null`.
    *   Therefore, the final output will be `{"output": null}`.
