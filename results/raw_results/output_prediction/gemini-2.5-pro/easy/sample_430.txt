[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1.  The function `f` is called with two arguments, `arr1` and `arr2`.
2.  `arr1` is initialized to the list `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]`.
3.  `arr2` is initialized to the list `["", 0, -1, []]`.
4.  Inside the function, `new_arr = arr1.copy()` creates a shallow copy of `arr1`. So, `new_arr` becomes `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]`. The original `arr1` is not modified by subsequent operations on `new_arr`.
5.  `new_arr.extend(arr2)` is called. The `extend()` method appends all the elements from the iterable `arr2` to the end of the list `new_arr`.
6.  The elements of `arr2` are `""`, `0`, `-1`, and `[]`.
7.  After the `extend` operation, `new_arr` will be `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.
8.  Finally, the function returns the modified `new_arr`.
9.  The return value is the list `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.
