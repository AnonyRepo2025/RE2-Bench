[THOUGHT]
1.  The user wants me to execute the Python function `truncate_number` with the given input.
2.  The function is defined as `def truncate_number(number: float) -> float: return number % 1.0`.
3.  The input provided for the `number` argument is `3.5`.
4.  The function's body consists of a single return statement: `return number % 1.0`.
5.  This statement calculates the modulo of the input `number` with `1.0`.
6.  The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division.
7.  In this case, the operation is `3.5 % 1.0`.
8.  When we divide `3.5` by `1.0`, the integer part of the quotient is `3`.
9.  The remainder is calculated as `3.5 - (1.0 * 3)`, which is `3.5 - 3.0`.
10. The result of the subtraction is `0.5`.
11. Therefore, the function will return the float value `0.5`.
12. The output structure is `{"output": XXX}`. I need to replace `XXX` with the returned value.
13. The final output will be `{"output": 0.5}`.
