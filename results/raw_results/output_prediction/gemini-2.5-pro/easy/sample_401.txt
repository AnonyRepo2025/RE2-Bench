[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with `text = "mathematics"` and `suffix = "example"`.
2. The `if` statement checks the condition `suffix and text.endswith(suffix)`.
3. The first part of the condition is `suffix`. The value of `suffix` is "example", which is a non-empty string, so it evaluates to `True` in a boolean context.
4. The second part of the condition is `text.endswith(suffix)`. This checks if the string "mathematics" ends with the string "example".
5. "mathematics" does not end with "example". Therefore, `text.endswith(suffix)` evaluates to `False`.
6. The full condition is `True and False`, which results in `False`.
7. Since the condition is `False`, the code block inside the `if` statement is skipped.
8. The function proceeds to the `return text` statement.
9. The value of `text` is "mathematics".
10. The function returns the string "mathematics".
