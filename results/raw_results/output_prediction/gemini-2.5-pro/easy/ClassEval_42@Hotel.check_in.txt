[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `check_in` method.

1.  **Initialize the `Hotel` object:**
    - `self.name` = "Test Hotel"
    - `self.available_rooms` = `{"single": 1, "double": 2}`
    - `self.booked_rooms` = `{"single": {}}`

2.  **Call the `check_in` method with the given arguments:**
    - `room_type` = "single"
    - `room_number` = 2
    - `name` = "guest 1"

3.  **Execute the `check_in` method step-by-step:**
    - `if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():`
        - `self.booked_rooms.keys()` is `dict_keys(['single'])`.
        - `room_type` ("single") is in the keys.
        - The condition `"single" not in ['single']` is `False`.
        - The code block is skipped.

    - `if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:`
        - `self.booked_rooms[room_type]` is `self.booked_rooms["single"]`, which is the empty dictionary `{}`.
        - `name` ("guest 1") is not a key in the empty dictionary `{}`.
        - The condition `"guest 1" in {}` is `False`.
        - The entire `if/elif/else` block is skipped.

4.  **Determine the return value:**
    - The method finishes execution without encountering any `return` statement.
    - In Python, a function that does not have an explicit `return` statement implicitly returns `None`.

5.  **Format the output:**
    - The structure is `{"output": XXX}`.
    - The predicted output value is `None`.
    - The JSON representation of `None` is `null`.
    - Therefore, the final output will be `{"output": null}`.
