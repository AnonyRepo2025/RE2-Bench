Let's trace the execution of the Python function `f` with the input `text = "scala"`.

1.  **`ls = text[::-1]`**:
    *   The input `text` is "scala".
    *   `[::-1]` is a slicing notation that reverses the string.
    *   `ls` becomes "alacs".

2.  **`text2 = ''`**:
    *   An empty string `text2` is initialized. This variable will accumulate the result.

3.  **`for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3):`**:
    *   Let's determine the parameters for the `range` function.
    *   `len(ls)` is the length of "alacs", which is 5.
    *   The `start` value is `len(ls) - 3`, which is `5 - 3 = 2`.
    *   The `stop` value is `0`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0.
    *   The `step` value is `-3`.
    *   The sequence of `i` generated by this range will be just `2`. The next value would be `2 - 3 = -1`, which is not greater than the stop value `0`, so the loop will execute only once.

4.  **Inside the loop (first and only iteration, `i = 2`):**
    *   **`ls[i:i + 3]`**: This creates a slice of the `ls` string.
        *   `i` is 2.
        *   The slice is `ls[2:2 + 3]`, which is `ls[2:5]`.
        *   `ls` is "alacs".
        *   The characters from index 2 up to (but not including) index 5 are 'a' (index 2), 'c' (index 3), 's' (index 4).
        *   The slice is "acs".
    *   **`'---'.join(ls[i:i + 3])`**: This joins the characters of the string "acs" with the separator "---".
        *   The result is `'a' + '---' + 'c' + '---' + 's'`, which is "a---c---s".
    *   **`text2 += ... + '---'`**: This appends the joined string and another "---" to `text2`.
        *   `text2` is currently `''`.
        *   `text2` becomes `"a---c---s" + "---"`, which is `"a---c---s---"`.

5.  **After the loop:**
    *   The loop finishes. The final value of `text2` is `"a---c---s---"`.

6.  **`return text2[:-3]`**:
    *   This returns a slice of `text2`, excluding the last 3 characters.
    *   `text2` is `"a---c---s---"`.
    *   The last 3 characters are "---".
    *   Removing them results in `"a---c---s"`.

7.  **Final Output**: The function returns the string `"a---c---s"`.
