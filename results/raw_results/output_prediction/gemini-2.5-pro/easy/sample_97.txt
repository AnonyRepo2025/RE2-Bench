[THOUGHT]
1.  The function `f` is called with the argument `lst` being an empty list `[]`.
2.  The first line inside the function is `lst.clear()`. This method removes all elements from the list `lst`. Since `lst` is already empty, it remains empty `[]`.
3.  The next line is a `for` loop: `for i in lst:`. This loop attempts to iterate over the elements of `lst`.
4.  Because `lst` is empty, the loop has no items to iterate over. Therefore, the body of the loop (the `if` statement) is never executed.
5.  The `for` loop has an `else` block. In Python, the `else` block of a `for` loop is executed if the loop completes its full iteration without being terminated by a `break` statement. Since the loop finished (by having nothing to iterate over) without any `break` (or `return` in this case), the `else` block is executed.
6.  Inside the `else` block, the statement `return True` is executed.
7.  The function `f` returns the boolean value `True`.
