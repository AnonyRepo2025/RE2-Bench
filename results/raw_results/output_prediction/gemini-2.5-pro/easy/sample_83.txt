Let's execute the code step by step with the given input `text = "qq0tt"`.

1.  **`l = text.rpartition('0')`**:
    *   The function `rpartition('0')` is called on the input string `text`, which is "qq0tt".
    *   `rpartition` searches for the last occurrence of the separator '0' and splits the string into a 3-part tuple.
    *   The separator '0' is found at index 2.
    *   The part before the separator is "qq".
    *   The separator itself is "0".
    *   The part after the separator is "tt".
    *   So, the variable `l` is assigned the tuple `('qq', '0', 'tt')`.

2.  **`if l[2] == '':`**:
    *   This line checks if the third element of the tuple `l` is an empty string.
    *   `l[2]` is "tt".
    *   The condition `"tt" == ''` is `False`.
    *   Therefore, the code block inside the `if` statement is skipped.

3.  **`return f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find('0') + 1}'`**:
    *   Since the `if` condition was false, this `return` statement is executed.
    *   It constructs a formatted string (f-string). Let's evaluate the expressions inside it:
        *   `len(l[0])`: `l[0]` is "qq". `len("qq")` is 2.
        *   `l[2].find('0')`: `l[2]` is "tt". The `find('0')` method is called on "tt". Since '0' is not found in "tt", `find` returns -1.
        *   `l[2].find('0') + 1`: This expression becomes `-1 + 1`, which evaluates to 0.
    *   The f-string combines these two results with a colon in between.
    *   The final string is `f'2:0'`, which is "2:0".

4.  **Conclusion**: The function `f` returns the string "2:0".
