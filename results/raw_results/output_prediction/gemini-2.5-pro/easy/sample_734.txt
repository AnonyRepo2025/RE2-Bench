[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` with the given input `nums = [5, 3, 3, 7]`.

1.  **Function Call:** The function `f` is called with the list `nums = [5, 3, 3, 7]`.

2.  **Loop Initialization:** The `for` loop starts. Let's determine the range of the loop.
    *   `len(nums)` is 4.
    *   The `range` is `range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1)`, which translates to `range(4 - 2, -1, -1)`, or `range(2, -1, -1)`.
    *   This means the loop will iterate with the index `i` taking the values 2, 1, and 0, in that order.

3.  **First Iteration (i = 2):**
    *   The current index `i` is 2.
    *   The element at this index is `nums[2]`, which is 3.
    *   The condition `if nums[i] % 2 == 0` is checked.
    *   `3 % 2` is 1.
    *   The condition `1 == 0` is `False`.
    *   The code inside the `if` block is skipped. The list `nums` remains `[5, 3, 3, 7]`.

4.  **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
    *   The current index `i` is 1.
    *   The element at this index is `nums[1]`, which is 3.
    *   The condition `if nums[i] % 2 == 0` is checked.
    *   `3 % 2` is 1.
    *   The condition `1 == 0` is `False`.
    *   The code inside the `if` block is skipped. The list `nums` remains `[5, 3, 3, 7]`.

5.  **Third Iteration (i = 0):**
    *   The current index `i` is 0.
    *   The element at this index is `nums[0]`, which is 5.
    *   The condition `if nums[i] % 2 == 0` is checked.
    *   `5 % 2` is 1.
    *   The condition `1 == 0` is `False`.
    *   The code inside the `if` block is skipped. The list `nums` remains `[5, 3, 3, 7]`.

6.  **End of Loop:** The loop has finished all its iterations.

7.  **Return Statement:** The function returns the final state of the `nums` list. Since no elements were removed, the list is unchanged.

8.  **Final Output:** The function returns `[5, 3, 3, 7]`.
