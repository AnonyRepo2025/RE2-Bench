Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with two arguments: `num` and `name`.
2. From the input, `num` is `23` and `name` is `"Cornareti"`.
3. Inside the function, a string variable `f_str` is initialized to `'quiz leader = {}, count = {}'`.
4. The `format()` method is called on this string: `f_str.format(name, num)`.
5. The `format()` method replaces the placeholders `{}` with the provided arguments in order.
6. The first placeholder `{}` is replaced by the value of the first argument, `name`, which is `"Cornareti"`.
7. The second placeholder `{}` is replaced by the value of the second argument, `num`, which is `23`.
8. The resulting string is `'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'`.
9. The function returns this new string.
