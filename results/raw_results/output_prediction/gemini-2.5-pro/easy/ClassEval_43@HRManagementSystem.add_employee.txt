1.  **Analyze the initial state:** The `HRManagementSystem` instance (`self`) is initialized with an `employees` dictionary. The input shows this dictionary is `{"1": {"name": "John Doe", ...}}`. The key for the existing employee is the string `"1"`.

2.  **Analyze the method call:** The `add_employee` method is called with the following arguments:
    *   `employee_id`: `1` (an integer)
    *   `name`: `"John Doe"`
    *   `position`: `"Manager"`
    *   `department`: `"HR"`
    *   `salary`: `5000`

3.  **Step-by-step execution of `add_employee`:**
    *   The first line inside the method is `if employee_id in self.employees:`.
    *   The value of `employee_id` is the integer `1`.
    *   The keys in `self.employees` are the strings present in the dictionary `{"1": ...}`. The only key is the string `"1"`.
    *   The condition becomes `if 1 in {"1": ...}:`.
    *   In Python, the integer `1` is not equal to the string `"1"`. Therefore, the `in` operator will evaluate to `False`.
    *   Since the condition is `False`, the code inside the `if` block is skipped, and the `else` block is executed.
    *   Inside the `else` block, a new employee is added to the `self.employees` dictionary: `self.employees[employee_id] = {'name': name, ...}`. The key used will be the integer `1`.
    *   After adding the new employee, the method returns `True`.

4.  **Determine the final output:** The method returns the boolean value `True`.

5.  **Format the output:** The required output structure is `{"output": XXX}`. Replacing `XXX` with the return value `True` gives the final JSON.
