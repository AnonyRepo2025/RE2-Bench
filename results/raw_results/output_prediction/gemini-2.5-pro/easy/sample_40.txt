[THOUGHT]
1.  The function `f` is called with the input `text = "the cow goes moo"`.
2.  Inside the function, the expression `len(text)` is evaluated. The length of the string "the cow goes moo" is 16.
3.  The expression `len(text) + 1` is evaluated, which is `16 + 1 = 17`.
4.  The method `text.ljust(17, '#')` is called.
5.  `ljust(width, fillchar)` returns a new string of length `width` by left-aligning the original string and padding the right side with `fillchar`.
6.  In this case, the original string is "the cow goes moo" (length 16).
7.  The target `width` is 17.
8.  The `fillchar` is '#'.
9.  The method will add `17 - 16 = 1` padding character ('#') to the right of the original string.
10. The resulting string is "the cow goes moo#".
11. The function returns this new string.
