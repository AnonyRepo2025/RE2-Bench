[THOUGHT]
1.  The function `f` is called with two arguments: `array` and `elem`.
2.  From the input, `array` is `[6, 2, 7, 1]` and `elem` is `6`.
3.  The first line of the function is `if elem in array:`.
4.  This checks if the value of `elem` (which is `6`) is present in the list `array` (`[6, 2, 7, 1]`).
5.  The number `6` is the first element of the list, so the condition `6 in [6, 2, 7, 1]` evaluates to `True`.
6.  Because the condition is `True`, the code inside the `if` block is executed: `return array.index(elem)`.
7.  `array.index(elem)` is called, which is equivalent to `[6, 2, 7, 1].index(6)`.
8.  The `.index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in the list.
9.  The element `6` is at the first position in the list, which corresponds to index `0`.
10. The function returns the value `0`.
11. The `return -1` statement is never reached.
12. The final output is `0`.
