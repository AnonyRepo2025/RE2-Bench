Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `triangle_area` is called with two arguments, `a` and `h`.
2. From the input, the value of `a` is `10`.
3. From the input, the value of `h` is `8`.
4. The function calculates the expression `a * h / 2.0`.
5. Substituting the values, the expression becomes `10 * 8 / 2.0`.
6. The multiplication `10 * 8` is performed first, resulting in `80`.
7. The expression is now `80 / 2.0`.
8. The division is performed. Since `2.0` is a float, the result will also be a float. `80 / 2.0` equals `40.0`.
9. The function returns the value `40.0`.
