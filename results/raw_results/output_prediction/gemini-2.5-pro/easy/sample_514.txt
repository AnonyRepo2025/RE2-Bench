[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` with the given input `text = "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.

1.  **`text.split()`**: The function first calls `text.split()`. Without any arguments, `split()` splits the string by any sequence of whitespace. In the input string `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`, there is a single space between "in" and "soup-.-".
    *   `text.split()` will produce the list: `['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-']`.

2.  **`for item in text.split():`**: The code now iterates through this list. The list `['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-']` is created once before the loop starts and does not change during the loop's execution.

3.  **First Iteration**:
    *   `item` is `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in'`.
    *   The `text` variable inside the loop is still the original string: `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.
    *   The first `replace` call is `text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ')`. This becomes `text.replace('--stew---corn-and-beans-in', ' ')`. The substring `'--stew---corn-and-beans-in'` is not found in the current `text`. So, `text` remains unchanged.
    *   The second `replace` call is `text.replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')`. This becomes `text.replace('-stew---corn-and-beans-in-', ' ')`. The substring `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in-'` is also not found in the current `text`. So, `text` remains unchanged.
    *   At the end of the first iteration, `text` is still `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.

4.  **Second Iteration**:
    *   `item` is `'soup-.-'`.
    *   The `text` variable is still `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.
    *   The first `replace` call is `text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ')`. This becomes `text.replace('-soup-.-', ' ')`. The substring `'-soup-.-'` is not found in `text` because there is a space before "soup". So, `text` remains unchanged.
    *   The second `replace` call is `text.replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')`. This becomes `text.replace('soup-.- -', ' ')`. The substring `'soup-.- -'` is not found in `text`. So, `text` remains unchanged.
    *   At the end of the second iteration, `text` is still `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.

5.  **End of Loop**: The loop finishes. The `text` variable was not modified during the loop.

6.  **`return text.strip('-')`**: The function returns the value of `text.strip('-')`.
    *   The current value of `text` is `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.
    *   The `.strip('-')` method removes any leading and trailing hyphens (`-`) from the string.
    *   It removes the single hyphen at the beginning.
    *   It removes the single hyphen at the end.
    *   The hyphens in the middle of the string (`---` between "stew" and "corn", and `-` between other words) are not affected.
    *   The resulting string is `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."`.

7.  **Final Output**: The function will return `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."`.
