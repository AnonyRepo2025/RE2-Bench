[THOUGHT]
1.  The user wants me to execute the Python function `f` with the given inputs and predict the output.
2.  The function is `def f(text, char): return text.rindex(char)`.
3.  The inputs are `text = "breakfast"` and `char = "e"`.
4.  The function calls the `rindex()` method on the `text` string.
5.  `rindex(sub)` returns the highest index in the string where substring `sub` is found. It's similar to `rfind()`, but raises a `ValueError` if the substring is not found, whereas `rfind()` returns -1.
6.  The string is "breakfast". Let's write it down with its indices:
    b r e a k f a s t
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
7.  The character to search for is "e".
8.  The character "e" appears only once in the string "breakfast".
9.  It is located at index 2.
10. Therefore, `text.rindex(char)` which is `"breakfast".rindex("e")` will return `2`.
11. The function returns this value.
12. The final output is the integer `2`.
