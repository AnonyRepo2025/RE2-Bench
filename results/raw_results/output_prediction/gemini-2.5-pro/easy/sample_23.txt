[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to execute a Python function `f` with the given inputs and predict the output.

**Function:**
```python
def f(text, chars):
    if chars:
        text = text.rstrip(chars)
    else:
        text = text.rstrip(' ')
    if text == '':
        return '-'
    return text
```

**Inputs:**
- `text`: "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"
- `chars`: "0123456789-"

**Step-by-step execution simulation:**

1.  The function `f` is called with `text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"` and `chars = "0123456789-"`.
2.  The first `if` statement checks `if chars:`. The `chars` variable is a non-empty string `"0123456789-"`, which evaluates to `True` in a boolean context.
3.  The code inside the `if` block is executed: `text = text.rstrip(chars)`.
4.  The `rstrip(chars)` method removes trailing characters from the `text` string that are present in the `chars` string.
5.  The `text` string is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"`.
6.  The `chars` string is `"0123456789-"`.
7.  Let's examine the end of the `text` string. The last character is '2'.
8.  Is '2' in `chars`? Yes. It is removed. The string conceptually becomes `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
9.  The new last character is '.'. Is '.' in `chars`? No. The stripping process stops here.
10. The result of `text.rstrip(chars)` is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
11. This result is assigned back to the `text` variable. So, `text` is now `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
12. The `else` block is skipped.
13. The next `if` statement checks `if text == '':`. The current value of `text` is not an empty string, so this condition is `False`.
14. The `return '-'` statement is skipped.
15. The function proceeds to the final line: `return text`.
16. The function returns the current value of `text`, which is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.

The final output will be the string `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
