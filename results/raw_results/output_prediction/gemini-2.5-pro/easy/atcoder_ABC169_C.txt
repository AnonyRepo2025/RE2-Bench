[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the execution of the Python code step by step with the given input.

1.  **`a, b = input().split()`**:
    *   The `input()` function reads the provided input string, which is `"1 0.01"`.
    *   The `.split()` method is called on this string. It splits the string by whitespace.
    *   The resulting list is `['1', '0.01']`.
    *   The first element, `'1'`, is assigned to the variable `a`.
    *   The second element, `'0.01'`, is assigned to the variable `b`.
    *   So, `a` is the string `"1"` and `b` is the string `"0.01"`.

2.  **`b = b[0] + b[2:]`**:
    *   This line modifies the string `b`.
    *   `b` is currently `"0.01"`.
    *   `b[0]` is the character at index 0, which is `"0"`.
    *   `b[2:]` is the slice of the string starting from index 2 to the end. This is `"01"`.
    *   The line concatenates `b[0]` and `b[2:]`. So, `"0" + "01"` results in `"001"`.
    *   The variable `b` is now updated to the string `"001"`.

3.  **`a = int(a)`**:
    *   The string `a` (`"1"`) is converted to an integer.
    *   `a` becomes the integer `1`.

4.  **`b = int(b)`**:
    *   The string `b` (`"001"`) is converted to an integer.
    *   `b` becomes the integer `1`.

5.  **`print(a * b // 100)`**:
    *   The expression inside the `print` function is evaluated.
    *   `a * b` is `1 * 1`, which equals `1`.
    *   `1 // 100` performs integer division (floor division). `1` divided by `100` is `0` with a remainder of `1`. The result of the integer division is `0`.
    *   The `print()` function will then output the value `0` to standard output.

The final output printed to the console will be `0`.
