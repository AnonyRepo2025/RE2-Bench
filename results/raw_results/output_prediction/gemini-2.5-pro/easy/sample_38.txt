[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` step by step.

1.  **Function Definition:**
    ```python
    def f(string):
        return string.title().replace(' ', '')
    ```
    The function takes one argument, `string`. It first applies the `.title()` method to this string and then applies the `.replace(' ', '')` method to the result of `.title()`.

2.  **Input:**
    The function is called with `string = "1oE-err bzz-bmm"`.

3.  **Step 1: `string.title()`**
    The `.title()` method is called on the input string `"1oE-err bzz-bmm"`.
    This method converts the string to title case. In title case, every word starts with an uppercase letter, and all other letters in the word are lowercase. A "word" is generally considered a sequence of letters separated by non-letter characters (like spaces, hyphens, numbers).
    - Let's analyze the first part: `"1oE-err"`.
        - `1` is not a letter, so it remains unchanged.
        - `o` is the first letter after a non-letter character (`1`), so it becomes uppercase: `O`.
        - `E` follows `o` in the same word, so it becomes lowercase: `e`.
        - `-` is not a letter, so it remains unchanged.
        - `e` is the first letter after a non-letter character (`-`), so it becomes uppercase: `E`.
        - `rr` follow `e` in the same word, so they remain lowercase.
        - So, `"1oE-err"` becomes `"1Oe-Err"`.
    - Now let's analyze the second part: `"bzz-bmm"`.
        - `b` is the first letter of a word (preceded by a space), so it becomes uppercase: `B`.
        - `zz` follow `b`, so they remain lowercase.
        - `-` is not a letter, so it remains unchanged.
        - `b` is the first letter after a non-letter character (`-`), so it becomes uppercase: `B`.
        - `mm` follow `b`, so they remain lowercase.
        - So, `"bzz-bmm"` becomes `"Bzz-Bmm"`.
    - Combining these parts, the result of `"1oE-err bzz-bmm".title()` is `"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm"`.

4.  **Step 2: `.replace(' ', '')`**
    This method is called on the result from the previous step, which is `"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm"`.
    The method `replace(' ', '')` finds all occurrences of a space character (`' '`) and replaces them with an empty string (`''`), effectively removing them.
    - The string `"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm"` has one space character between `Err` and `Bzz`.
    - Removing this space results in the string `"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"`.

5.  **Return Value:**
    The function returns the final string `"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"`.
