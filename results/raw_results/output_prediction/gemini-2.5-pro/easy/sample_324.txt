[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step with the given input.

1.  **Function Call**: The function `f` is called with `nums = []`.

2.  **`asc, desc = (nums.copy(), [])`**:
    *   `nums.copy()` is called on `[]`. This creates a shallow copy, which is also `[]`.
    *   `asc` is assigned the value `[]`.
    *   `desc` is assigned the value `[]`.
    *   After this line, `asc` is `[]` and `desc` is `[]`.

3.  **`asc.reverse()`**:
    *   The `reverse()` method is called on the list `asc`.
    *   `asc` is `[]`. Reversing an empty list results in the same empty list.
    *   `asc` remains `[]`.

4.  **`desc = asc[:len(asc) // 2]`**:
    *   `len(asc)` is `len([])`, which is `0`.
    *   The integer division `0 // 2` results in `0`.
    *   The expression becomes `desc = asc[:0]`.
    *   This is a slice of the list `asc` from the beginning up to index 0. For an empty list, this slice is also an empty list.
    *   `desc` is reassigned the value `[]`.

5.  **`return desc + asc + desc`**:
    *   The function returns the concatenation of the three lists.
    *   `desc` is `[]`.
    *   `asc` is `[]`.
    *   `desc` is `[]`.
    *   The operation is `[] + [] + []`.
    *   Concatenating empty lists results in a single empty list `[]`.

6.  **Final Result**: The function returns `[]`.
