[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step with the given inputs.

1.  **Function `f` is called with `text = "undbs l"` and `position = 1`.**

2.  **`length = len(text)`**:
    *   The input `text` is "undbs l".
    *   The length of this string is 7.
    *   So, `length` is assigned the value 7.

3.  **`index = position % (length + 1)`**:
    *   `position` is 1.
    *   `length + 1` is 7 + 1 = 8.
    *   The expression becomes `index = 1 % 8`.
    *   The modulo operation `1 % 8` results in 1.
    *   So, `index` is assigned the value 1.

4.  **`if position < 0 or index < 0:`**:
    *   `position` is 1, which is not less than 0.
    *   `index` is 1, which is not less than 0.
    *   The condition `1 < 0 or 1 < 0` evaluates to `False`.
    *   The code block inside the `if` statement is skipped.

5.  **`new_text = list(text)`**:
    *   The string `text` ("undbs l") is converted into a list of its characters.
    *   `new_text` becomes `['u', 'n', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l']`.

6.  **`new_text.pop(index)`**:
    *   `index` is 1.
    *   The `pop(1)` method is called on the `new_text` list. This removes the element at index 1.
    *   The element at index 1 is 'n'.
    *   After removal, `new_text` becomes `['u', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l']`.

7.  **`return ''.join(new_text)`**:
    *   The `join` method is called on an empty string `''`. It concatenates all the elements of the `new_text` list.
    *   The list `['u', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l']` is joined to form the string "udbs l".
    *   The function returns this string.

8.  **Final result**: The function returns "udbs l".
