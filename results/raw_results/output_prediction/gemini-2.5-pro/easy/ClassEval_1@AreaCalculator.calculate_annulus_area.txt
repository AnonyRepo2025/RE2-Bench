[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the function call:** The user wants to predict the output of the `calculate_annulus_area` method of the `AreaCalculator` class.
2.  **Examine the inputs:**
    *   `self`: An instance of `AreaCalculator` is created. Its `radius` attribute is set to `2000` by the `__init__` method.
    *   `args`: The positional arguments passed to the method are `inner_radius = 0` and `outer_radius = 1`.
    *   `kwargs`: There are no keyword arguments.
3.  **Step-by-step execution of `calculate_annulus_area`:**
    *   The method is called with `inner_radius = 0` and `outer_radius = 1`.
    *   The `self.radius` attribute (which is 2000) is not used within this specific method.
    *   The method calculates the return value using the formula: `math.pi * (outer_radius ** 2 - inner_radius ** 2)`.
    *   Substitute the argument values into the formula: `math.pi * (1 ** 2 - 0 ** 2)`.
    *   Calculate the squares: `1 ** 2` is `1`, and `0 ** 2` is `0`.
    *   The expression becomes: `math.pi * (1 - 0)`.
    *   Calculate the subtraction: `1 - 0` is `1`.
    *   The expression simplifies to: `math.pi * 1`.
    *   The final result is `math.pi`.
    *   The value of `math.pi` in Python is `3.141592653589793`.
4.  **Format the output:** The calculated value `3.141592653589793` needs to be placed in the `XXX` placeholder of the provided JSON structure.
