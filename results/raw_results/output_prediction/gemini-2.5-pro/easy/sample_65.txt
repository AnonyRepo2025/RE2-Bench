[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the execution of the function `f(nums, index)` step by step.

1.  **Function Call:** The function `f` is called with `nums = [3, 2, 0, 7]` and `index = 3`.

2.  **Return Statement:** The function will return the result of the expression `nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2`.

3.  **Order of Operations:** In Python, for the `+` operator, the left operand is evaluated before the right operand.

4.  **Evaluate Left Operand:** The left operand is `nums[index] % 42`.
    *   `index` is `3`.
    *   `nums[index]` is `nums[3]`, which accesses the element at index 3 in the list `[3, 2, 0, 7]`. This element is `7`.
    *   The expression becomes `7 % 42`.
    *   The modulo operator (`%`) gives the remainder of a division. `7` divided by `42` is `0` with a remainder of `7`.
    *   So, the result of the left operand is `7`.

5.  **Evaluate Right Operand:** The right operand is `nums.pop(index) * 2`.
    *   `index` is `3`.
    *   The expression is `nums.pop(3) * 2`.
    *   `nums.pop(3)` is executed. This method does two things:
        a. It removes the element at index 3 from the list `nums`. At this point, `nums` is still `[3, 2, 0, 7]`. The element at index 3 is `7`. After the pop operation, the list `nums` is modified to `[3, 2, 0]`.
        b. It returns the removed element, which is `7`.
    *   The expression becomes `7 * 2`.
    *   `7 * 2` equals `14`.
    *   So, the result of the right operand is `14`.

6.  **Final Calculation:** Now, the results of the left and right operands are added together.
    *   `7 + 14`
    *   The sum is `21`.

7.  **Return Value:** The function returns `21`.
