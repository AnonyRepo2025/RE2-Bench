[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of a given Python script with a specific input.

**Code Execution Analysis:**

1.  **`n = int(input())`**: The script reads the input string `"10"` and converts it to an integer. The variable `n` is assigned the value `10`.
2.  **`i, j = (1, n * n)`**: Two variables, `i` and `j`, are initialized.
    *   `i` is set to `1`.
    *   `j` is set to `n * n`, which is `10 * 10 = 100`.
    *   So, at the start, `i = 1` and `j = 100`.
3.  **`while i < j:`**: The script enters a `while` loop. The loop will continue as long as the value of `i` is less than the value of `j`. The initial condition `1 < 100` is true.
4.  **Inside the loop:**
    *   **`print(i, j)`**: Prints the current values of `i` and `j`, separated by a space, followed by a newline.
    *   **`i += 1`**: Increments `i` by 1.
    *   **`j -= 1`**: Decrements `j` by 1.

**Step-by-step simulation:**

*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   Condition: `1 < 100` is `True`.
    *   `print(1, 100)`. Output: `1 100`
    *   `i` becomes `2`.
    *   `j` becomes `99`.
*   **Iteration 2:**
    *   Condition: `2 < 99` is `True`.
    *   `print(2, 99)`. Output: `2 99`
    *   `i` becomes `3`.
    *   `j` becomes `98`.
*   **... (The loop continues) ...**
*   The loop continues with `i` increasing and `j` decreasing. We need to find the last iteration where `i < j`.
*   In each iteration, the difference `j - i` decreases by 2. The loop will stop when `i` becomes equal to or greater than `j`.
*   Let's find the meeting point. If they were to meet, `1 + k = 100 - k`, which gives `2k = 99`, so `k = 49.5`. This means they don't meet at an integer value. They will cross.
*   **Let's check the state when `i` is 50:**
    *   This happens after 49 iterations (since `i` starts at 1).
    *   `i` will be `1 + 49 = 50`.
    *   `j` will be `100 - 49 = 51`.
    *   Condition: `50 < 51` is `True`.
    *   `print(50, 51)`. Output: `50 51`
    *   `i` becomes `51`.
    *   `j` becomes `50`.
*   **Next iteration check:**
    *   Condition: `51 < 50` is `False`.
    *   The loop terminates.

**Final Output:**
The script will print pairs of numbers on new lines, starting from `1 100` and ending with `50 51`. The final output will be a multi-line string.

```
1 100
2 99
3 98
...
49 52
50 51
```
I will represent this as a single string with `\n` as the newline character.
