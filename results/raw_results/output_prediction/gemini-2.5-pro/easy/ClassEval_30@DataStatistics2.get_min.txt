[THOUGHT]
1.  **Initialization**: An instance of the `DataStatistics2` class is created. The `__init__` method is called with `data = "[ 0 -1 -3  2]"`.
2.  **`__init__` method execution**:
    -   The input `data` is a string: `"[ 0 -1 -3  2]"`.
    -   The line `self.data = np.array(data)` is executed.
    -   When `np.array()` is called with a single string as its argument, it does not parse the string to extract numbers. Instead, it creates a NumPy array containing that single string as its only element.
    -   So, `self.data` becomes a 0-dimensional array: `array('[ 0 -1 -3  2]', dtype='<U13')`.
3.  **`get_min` method call**: The `get_min` method is called on this instance.
4.  **`get_min` method execution**:
    -   The line `return np.min(self.data)` is executed.
    -   `np.min` is called on the array `array('[ 0 -1 -3  2]', dtype='<U13')`.
    -   Since this array contains only one element (the string `"[ 0 -1 -3  2]"`), the minimum value in the array is that element itself.
    -   Therefore, the function will return the string `"[ 0 -1 -3  2]"`.
