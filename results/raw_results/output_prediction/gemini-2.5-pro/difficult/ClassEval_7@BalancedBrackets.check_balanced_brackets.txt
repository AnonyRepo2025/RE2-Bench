[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `check_balanced_brackets` method.

**1. Initial State:**
- `self.stack` = `["["]`
- `self.left_brackets` = `['(', '{', '[']`
- `self.right_brackets` = `[')', '}', ']']`
- `self.expr` = `"[(){}"`

**2. Method Execution: `check_balanced_brackets()`**

- **`self.clear_expr()` is called first.**
    - This method filters `self.expr` to keep only characters present in `self.left_brackets` or `self.right_brackets`.
    - The original `self.expr` is `"[(){}"`. All characters are brackets.
    - So, `self.expr` remains `"[(){}"`.

- **The `for` loop begins: `for Brkt in self.expr:`**
    - The loop will iterate through the characters: `[`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`.
    - The stack at the start of the loop is `["["]`.

    - **`Brkt` = `'['`:**
        - `'['` is in `self.left_brackets`.
        - `self.stack.append('[')`.
        - `self.stack` is now `['[', '[']`.

    - **`Brkt` = `'('`:**
        - `'('` is in `self.left_brackets`.
        - `self.stack.append('(')`.
        - `self.stack` is now `['[', '[', '(']`.

    - **`Brkt` = `')'`:**
        - `')'` is not in `self.left_brackets`, so the `else` block is executed.
        - `Current_Brkt = self.stack.pop()`. This pops `'('` from the stack.
        - `Current_Brkt` is `'('`.
        - `self.stack` is now `['[', '[']`.
        - The condition `if Current_Brkt == '(':` is true.
        - The inner condition `if Brkt != ')'` is `')' != ')'`, which is false. Nothing happens.

    - **`Brkt` = `'{'`:**
        - `'{'` is in `self.left_brackets`.
        - `self.stack.append('{')`.
        - `self.stack` is now `['[', '[', '{']`.

    - **`Brkt` = `'}'`:**
        - `'}'` is not in `self.left_brackets`, so the `else` block is executed.
        - `Current_Brkt = self.stack.pop()`. This pops `'{'` from the stack.
        - `Current_Brkt` is `'{'`.
        - `self.stack` is now `['[', '[']`.
        - The condition `if Current_Brkt == '{':` is true.
        - The inner condition `if Brkt != '}'` is `'}' != '}'`, which is false. Nothing happens.

- **The `for` loop finishes.**

- **Final check: `if self.stack:`**
    - At this point, `self.stack` is `['[', '[']`.
    - The list is not empty, so the condition is true.
    - The function executes `return False`.

**3. Conclusion:**
The method will return `False`.
