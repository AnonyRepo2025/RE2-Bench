[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `_expand_partial_derivative` method on an instance of the `PartialDerivative` class.

**1. Analyze the input:**
The provided input is:
```json
{
    "self": {
        "_indices": null,
        "_free": null,
        "_dum": null
    },
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
This input defines the state of the `self` object before the method call. However, it's missing the crucial `self.args` attribute, which contains the expression and the variables of the partial derivative (`self.expr` and `self.variables`). The `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` attributes are `null`, which is their state before being computed. The method `_expand_partial_derivative` will compute them.

Since `self.args` is not provided, I must assume a representative input that makes sense in the context of the `PartialDerivative` class, which is part of a tensor module. A simple case would be a derivative of a scalar symbol, but that wouldn't exercise the tensor-specific logic in the code. A more representative case is the derivative of one tensor with respect to another.

Let's assume `self` is an instance representing the partial derivative of a tensor `A(i)` with respect to another tensor `B(j)`.
- `self.expr` would be `A(i)`, a `Tensor` with one free index `i`.
- `self.variables` would be `(B(j),)`, a tuple containing a `Tensor` with one free index `j`.
- `i` and `j` are `TensorIndex` objects.

**2. Step-by-step simulation of `_expand_partial_derivative`:**

The method starts by calling `_contract_indices_for_derivative`.
```python
args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)
```
Let's trace `_contract_indices_for_derivative(A(i), (B(j),))`:

- `expr` is `A(i)`.
- `variables` is `(B(j),)`.
- The method iterates through `variables`. The variable `B(j)` is a `Tensor`. The code creates a version with opposite valence for its free indices: `B(-j)`.
- `variables_opposite_valence` becomes `[B(-j)]`.
- It then calls `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices([A(i), B(-j)], replace_indices=True)`.
    - The arguments to this function are the expression `A(i)` and the modified variable `B(-j)`.
    - It first gets the indices of the arguments: `get_indices(A(i))` is `(i,)` and `get_indices(B(-j))` is `(-j,)`. So `args_indices` is `[(i,), (-j,)]`.
    - It then calls `TensMul._indices_to_free_dum([(i,), (-j,)])`. This function analyzes the indices to find free and dummy (contracted) indices.
        - The index `i` appears once (covariant). It's a free index.
        - The index `j` appears once (contravariant, as `-j`). It's also a free index.
        - There are no repeated indices for contraction.
        - `_indices_to_free_dum` will return:
            - `indices`: `[i, -j]` (a flat list of all indices).
            - `free`: `[(i, 0), (-j, 1)]` (a list of (index, position) tuples for free indices).
            - `free_names`: `['i', 'j']`.
            - `dummy_data`: `[]` (since there are no contractions).
    - Back in `_tensMul_contract_indices`, since `dummy_data` is empty, no index replacement occurs.
    - It returns the results:
        - `args`: `[A(i), B(-j)]`
        - `indices`: `[i, -j]`
        - `free`: `[(i, 0), (-j, 1)]`
        - `dum`: `()` (an empty tuple, as there are no dummy indices).
- Back in `_contract_indices_for_derivative`, there's a final loop that reverts the valence change on the variables in the returned `args` list. `B(-j)` is changed back to `B(j)`. Note that this does *not* affect the `indices`, `free`, or `dum` variables that have already been computed.
- `_contract_indices_for_derivative` returns `([A(i), B(j)], [i, -j], [(i, 0), (-j, 1)], ())`.

Now, back in `_expand_partial_derivative`:
- `args` = `[A(i), B(j)]`
- `indices` = `[i, -j]`
- `free` = `[(i, 0), (-j, 1)]`
- `dum` = `()`
- A new object `obj` is created: `obj = self.func(*args)`, which is `PartialDerivative(A(i), B(j))`.
- The computed index information is assigned to this new object:
    - `obj._indices = [i, -j]`
    - `obj._free = [(i, 0), (-j, 1)]`
    - `obj._dum = ()`
- `result` is set to `obj`.
- The code then checks the type of the expression `obj.expr`, which is `A(i)`.
- `A(i)` is a `Tensor`, not a `TensAdd` or `TensMul`. The `if/elif` conditions are false.
- The method returns the `result` object.

**3. Predict the output:**
The function returns the `result` object. The question asks for the values of the `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` attributes of this returned object. Based on the simulation:
- `_indices` is the list of `TensorIndex` objects `[i, -j]`.
- `_free` is the list of tuples `[(i, 0), (-j, 1)]`.
- `_dum` is the empty tuple `()`.

To format this as JSON, I will represent the `TensorIndex` objects by their string representations (`'i'`, `'-j'`) and tuples/lists as JSON arrays.
- `_indices` -> `["i", "-j"]`
- `_free` -> `[["i", 0], ["-j", 1]]`
- `_dum` -> `[]`

This gives the final JSON output.
