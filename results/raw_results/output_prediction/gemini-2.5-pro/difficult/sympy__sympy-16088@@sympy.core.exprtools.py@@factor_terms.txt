[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `factor_terms` function from the `sympy` library.

**Input:**
- `expr`: `"R3 + R4 + 4050"`
- `kwargs`: `{}` (so default values for `radical`, `clear`, `fraction`, `sign` are used)

**Execution Analysis:**

1.  **`factor_terms(expr, ...)`:** The main function is called with the string `"R3 + R4 + 4050"`.
2.  **`expr = sympify(expr)`:** The first step inside `factor_terms` is to convert the input string into a SymPy expression.
    *   `sympify("R3 + R4 + 4050")` will parse the string.
    *   It recognizes `R3` and `R4` as symbols and `4050` as an integer.
    *   The result is a SymPy `Add` object, equivalent to `Symbol('R3') + Symbol('R4') + Integer(4050)`.
3.  **`return do(expr)`:** The internal helper function `do` is called with the `Add` object.
4.  **`do(R3 + R4 + 4050)`:**
    *   The expression `expr` is an `Add` instance, so it's not an `Atom`, `Pow`, or `Function`.
    *   The condition `isinstance(expr, (Sum, Integral))` is false.
    *   The code proceeds to `cont, p = expr.as_content_primitive(radical=radical, clear=clear)`.
        *   `as_content_primitive` on an `Add` expression finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integer coefficients of its terms.
        *   The terms are `1*R3`, `1*R4`, and `4050`.
        *   The coefficients are `1`, `1`, and `4050`.
        *   The GCD of `(1, 1, 4050)` is `1`.
        *   So, `cont` becomes `Integer(1)` and `p` (the primitive part) remains `R3 + R4 + 4050`.
    *   The condition `if p.is_Add:` is true.
    *   `list_args = [do(a) for a in Add.make_args(p)]`:
        *   `Add.make_args(p)` returns `(R3, R4, 4050)`.
        *   `do` is called recursively on each term.
        *   `do(R3)`: `R3` is an `Atom`, so it returns `R3`.
        *   `do(R4)`: `R4` is an `Atom`, so it returns `R4`.
        *   `do(4050)`: `4050` is an `Atom`, so it returns `4050`.
        *   `list_args` becomes `[R3, R4, 4050]`.
    *   The next `if` block checks if all terms are negative. They are not, so it's skipped.
    *   The `special` dictionary logic for complex powers is not triggered.
    *   `p = Add._from_args(list_args)`: `p` is reconstructed as `R3 + R4 + 4050`.
    *   `p = gcd_terms(p, ...)`:
        *   `gcd_terms` attempts to find and factor out the greatest common divisor of the terms in the `Add` expression.
        *   The terms are `R3`, `R4`, and `4050`.
        *   There are no common symbolic factors. The numerical GCD is 1.
        *   Therefore, `gcd_terms` returns the expression unchanged: `R3 + R4 + 4050`.
    *   `rv = _keep_coeff(cont, p, ...)`:
        *   This is called with `cont=1` and `p=R3 + R4 + 4050`.
        *   The result is `1 * (R3 + R4 + 4050)`, which is simply `R3 + R4 + 4050`.
    *   The `do` function returns this result.
5.  **Final Result:** The `factor_terms` function returns the result from `do`, which is the SymPy expression `R3 + R4 + 4050`.

The function's purpose is to factor out common terms. Since there are no common terms in the input expression, it is returned as is. The output will be the string representation of this SymPy object.

**Predicted output:** The string representation of `R3 + R4 + 4050`.
The JSON structure requires this string to be the value for the "output" key.
```json
{
    "output": "R3 + R4 + 4050"
}
```
This seems correct.
