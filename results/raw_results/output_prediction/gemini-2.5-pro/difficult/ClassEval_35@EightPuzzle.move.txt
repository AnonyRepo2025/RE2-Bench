[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `move` method in the `EightPuzzle` class.

1.  **Function:** `move(self, state, direction)`
2.  **Inputs:**
    *   `self`: An instance of `EightPuzzle`. Its attributes are not directly used in the `move` logic, except for calling the `find_blank` method.
    *   `state`: `[[1, 6, 2], [7, 8, 0], [4, 5, 3]]`
    *   `direction`: `"left"`
3.  **Execution Analysis:**
    *   The `move` method is called.
    *   `i, j = self.find_blank(state)`: The `find_blank` method is called with the provided `state`. It iterates through the 2D list to find the coordinates of the number `0`.
        *   `state[0]` is `[1, 6, 2]`. No `0`.
        *   `state[1]` is `[7, 8, 0]`. The `0` is at index `2`.
        *   So, `find_blank` returns `(1, 2)`.
        *   `i` is set to `1`, and `j` is set to `2`.
    *   `new_state = [row[:] for row in state]`: A deep copy of the `state` is created. `new_state` is now `[[1, 6, 2], [7, 8, 0], [4, 5, 3]]`.
    *   The code checks the `direction`. It is `'left'`.
    *   The `elif direction == 'left':` block is executed.
    *   `new_state[i][j], new_state[i][j - 1] = (new_state[i][j - 1], new_state[i][j])`: This line swaps the blank space with the element to its left.
        *   `i` is `1`, `j` is `2`.
        *   `new_state[i][j]` is `new_state[1][2]`, which is `0`.
        *   `new_state[i][j - 1]` is `new_state[1][1]`, which is `8`.
        *   The values are swapped. `new_state[1][2]` becomes `8`, and `new_state[1][1]` becomes `0`.
    *   The `new_state` is now `[[1, 6, 2], [7, 0, 8], [4, 5, 3]]`.
    *   `return new_state`: The function returns the modified `new_state`.
4.  **Final Output:** The returned value is the list `[[1, 6, 2], [7, 0, 8], [4, 5, 3]]`. This needs to be formatted into the specified JSON structure.
