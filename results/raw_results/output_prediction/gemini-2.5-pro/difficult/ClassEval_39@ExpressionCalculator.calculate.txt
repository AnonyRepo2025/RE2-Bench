[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `calculate` method for the given input expression "2 + 4 / 4".

Let's trace the execution of the `ExpressionCalculator.calculate` method step by step.

1.  **`calculate("2 + 4 / 4")` is called.**
    -   Inside `calculate`, the first call is to `self.transform("2 + 4 / 4")`.

2.  **`transform(expression)` execution:**
    -   `expression` = "2 + 4 / 4"
    -   `re.sub('\\s+', '', expression)` removes all whitespace. `expression` becomes "2+4/4".
    -   `re.sub('=$', '', expression)` removes a trailing '=' if present. No change.
    -   The code then converts the string to a list `arr = ['2', '+', '4', '/', '4']`.
    -   It iterates through `arr` to find '-' characters that represent negative numbers and replace them with '~'. The expression "2+4/4" has no '-' characters, so `arr` remains unchanged.
    -   The final `if` condition `arr[0] == '~'` is false.
    -   The method returns `''.join(arr)`, which is "2+4/4".

3.  **Back in `calculate`, `self.prepare("2+4/4")` is called.**
    -   This method converts the infix expression to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) and stores it in `self.postfix_stack`.
    -   Initialization: `op_stack = deque([','])`, `self.postfix_stack = deque([])`, `arr = ['2', '+', '4', '/', '4']`.
    -   The code iterates through `arr`:
        -   **'2'**: It's a number. `count` becomes 1.
        -   **'+'**: It's an operator.
            -   The number '2' (from `arr[0:1]`) is appended to `postfix_stack`. `postfix_stack` is now `deque(['2'])`.
            -   The code compares the current operator '+' with the top of `op_stack` (which is ','). Assuming a standard precedence comparison (which the missing `compare` method would do), '+' has higher precedence than the sentinel ','.
            -   '+' is pushed onto `op_stack`. `op_stack` is now `deque([',', '+'])`.
        -   **'4'**: It's a number. `count` becomes 1.
        -   **'/'**: It's an operator.
            -   The number '4' (from `arr[2:3]`) is appended to `postfix_stack`. `postfix_stack` is now `deque(['2', '4'])`.
            -   The code compares '/' with the top of `op_stack` ('+'). '/' has higher precedence than '+'.
            -   '/' is pushed onto `op_stack`. `op_stack` is now `deque([',', '+', '/'])`.
        -   **'4'**: It's a number. `count` becomes 1.
    -   After the loop, the last number '4' (from `arr[4:5]`) is appended to `postfix_stack`. `postfix_stack` is now `deque(['2', '4', '4'])`.
    -   Finally, the remaining operators are popped from `op_stack` and appended to `postfix_stack`.
        -   Pop '/', append to `postfix_stack`. `postfix_stack` is `deque(['2', '4', '4', '/'])`.
        -   Pop '+', append to `postfix_stack`. `postfix_stack` is `deque(['2', '4', '4', '/', '+'])`.
    -   The `prepare` method finishes. The postfix expression is `2 4 4 / +`.

4.  **Back in `calculate`, the postfix evaluation begins.**
    -   `self.postfix_stack` is `deque(['2', '4', '4', '/', '+'])`.
    -   `self.postfix_stack.reverse()` is called. `postfix_stack` becomes `deque(['+', '/', '4', '4', '2'])`.
    -   `result_stack = deque([])`.
    -   The code enters a `while` loop to process the reversed postfix stack.
        -   `pop '2'`: It's a number. Push '2' to `result_stack`. `result_stack` is `deque(['2'])`.
        -   `pop '4'`: It's a number. Push '4' to `result_stack`. `result_stack` is `deque(['2', '4'])`.
        -   `pop '4'`: It's a number. Push '4' to `result_stack`. `result_stack` is `deque(['2', '4', '4'])`.
        -   `pop '/'`: It's an operator.
            -   Pop '4' from `result_stack` (`second_value`).
            -   Pop '4' from `result_stack` (`first_value`).
            -   Call `_calculate('4', '4', '/')`. This returns `Decimal('4') / Decimal('4')` which is `Decimal('1.0')`.
            -   Push the result '1.0' to `result_stack`. `result_stack` is `deque(['2', '1.0'])`.
        -   `pop '+'`: It's an operator.
            -   Pop '1.0' from `result_stack` (`second_value`).
            -   Pop '2' from `result_stack` (`first_value`).
            -   Call `_calculate('2', '1.0', '+')`. This returns `Decimal('2') + Decimal('1.0')` which is `Decimal('3.0')`.
            -   Push the result '3.0' to `result_stack`. `result_stack` is `deque(['3.0'])`.
    -   The loop finishes as `postfix_stack` is now empty.

5.  **Final return statement:**
    -   `return float(eval('*'.join(result_stack)))`
    -   `result_stack` contains `['3.0']`.
    -   `'*'.join(result_stack)` results in the string `'3.0'`.
    -   `eval('3.0')` evaluates to the float `3.0`.
    -   `float(3.0)` is `3.0`.

The function will return `3.0`.
