[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `restify` function.

**Input:**
- `cls` = `null`, which translates to `None` in Python.

**Function `restify` execution trace:**

1.  The function `restify` is called with `cls=None`.
2.  The `try` block is entered.
3.  The first condition is checked: `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`.
4.  Since `cls` is `None`, the condition `cls is None` evaluates to `True`.
5.  The code inside this `if` block is executed.
6.  The function returns the string `':py:obj:`None``.
7.  The execution of the function stops here.

The predicted output is the string `':py:obj:`None``. I will place this value into the provided JSON structure.
