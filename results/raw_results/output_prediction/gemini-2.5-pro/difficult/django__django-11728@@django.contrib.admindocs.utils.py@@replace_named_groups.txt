`replace_named_groups` function.

**Input:**
- `pattern`: "admin/password_change/done/"

**Execution Analysis:**

1.  The function is designed to find and replace named capturing groups in a regular expression pattern string. A named group looks like `(?P<name>...)`.
2.  The first step is `named_group_indices = [(m.start(0), m.end(0), m.group(1)) for m in named_group_matcher.finditer(pattern)]`.
3.  The `named_group_matcher` regex is `\(\?P(<\w+>)`, which searches for the start of a named group, like `(?P<group_name>`.
4.  The input `pattern` is `"admin/password_change/done/"`.
5.  The `named_group_matcher.finditer()` call will search for occurrences of the regex in the input string.
6.  The input string `"admin/password_change/done/"` does not contain any substrings that match the `named_group_matcher` regex.
7.  Therefore, `finditer` will return an empty iterator, and the list comprehension will produce an empty list: `named_group_indices = []`.
8.  The subsequent `for` loop, `for start, end, group_name in named_group_indices:`, will not execute because its iterable is empty.
9.  The next `for` loop, `for group_pattern, group_name in group_pattern_and_name:`, will also not execute because `group_pattern_and_name` is an empty list.
10. Finally, the function executes `return pattern`. Since the `pattern` variable was never modified, the function returns the original input string.

**Predicted output:**
The function will return the input string "admin/password_change/done/" as is.
