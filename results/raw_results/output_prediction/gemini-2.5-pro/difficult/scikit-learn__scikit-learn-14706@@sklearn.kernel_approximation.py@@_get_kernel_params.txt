The user wants me to predict the output of the `_get_kernel_params` method.

Let's trace the execution of the `_get_kernel_params` method with the given `self` object.

1.  `params = self.kernel_params`: `self.kernel_params` is `null` (which is `None` in Python). So, `params` is set to `None`.
2.  `if params is None:`: This condition is `True`.
3.  `params = {}`: `params` is now an empty dictionary.
4.  `if not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed':`:
    *   `self.kernel` is the string `"polynomial"`.
    *   `callable("polynomial")` is `False`, so `not callable(...)` is `True`.
    *   `"polynomial" != 'precomputed'` is `True`.
    *   The entire condition is `True and True`, which is `True`. The code enters this block.
5.  `for param in KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]:`:
    *   The `KERNEL_PARAMS` dictionary (imported from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`) contains the valid parameters for each kernel. For the `"polynomial"` kernel, `KERNEL_PARAMS['polynomial']` is `('gamma', 'degree', 'coef0')`.
    *   The loop will iterate over these three strings.
6.  **First iteration:** `param` is `'gamma'`.
    *   `if getattr(self, param) is not None:`: This checks if `self.gamma` is not `None`.
    *   `self.gamma` is `null` (`None`), so the condition is `False`.
7.  **Second iteration:** `param` is `'degree'`.
    *   `if getattr(self, param) is not None:`: This checks if `self.degree` is not `None`.
    *   `self.degree` is `3.1`, which is not `None`. The condition is `True`.
    *   `params[param] = getattr(self, param)`: This executes `params['degree'] = 3.1`.
    *   `params` is now `{'degree': 3.1}`.
8.  **Third iteration:** `param` is `'coef0'`.
    *   `if getattr(self, param) is not None:`: This checks if `self.coef0` is not `None`.
    *   `self.coef0` is `0.1`, which is not `None`. The condition is `True`.
    *   `params[param] = getattr(self, param)`: This executes `params['coef0'] = 0.1`.
    *   `params` is now `{'degree': 3.1, 'coef0': 0.1}`.
9.  The `for` loop finishes.
10. The `elif` block is skipped because the preceding `if` was `True`.
11. `return params`: The function returns the `params` dictionary, which is `{'degree': 3.1, 'coef0': 0.1}`.

The output structure requires values for `coef0` and `degree`.
- `coef0` will be `0.1`.
- `degree` will be `3.1`.
