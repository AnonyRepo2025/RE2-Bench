`_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` with the following parameters:
- `self`: An instance of `OneHotEncoder` where `_infrequent_enabled` is `False`.
- `feature_idx`: `2`
- `drop_idx`: `"1"`

The execution flow of the `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` function is as follows:

1.  The function starts by checking the value of `self._infrequent_enabled`.
2.  The first line is `if not self._infrequent_enabled:`.
3.  From the input, `self._infrequent_enabled` is `False`.
4.  The condition `not False` evaluates to `True`.
5.  The code block inside the `if` statement is executed.
6.  This block contains a single statement: `return drop_idx`.
7.  The value of the `drop_idx` argument is `"1"`.
8.  The function immediately returns the value `"1"` and terminates. The rest of the function is not executed.

Therefore, the output of the function is the value of `drop_idx`.
