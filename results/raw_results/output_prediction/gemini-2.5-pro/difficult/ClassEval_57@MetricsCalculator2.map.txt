[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `map` static method from the `MetricsCalculator2` class.

**Input:**
- `data`: `[]` (an empty list)

**Step-by-step execution of the `map` method:**

1.  The method is called with `data = []`.
2.  The first `if` condition is `if type(data) != list and type(data) != tuple:`.
    - `type(data)` is `list`.
    - The condition `False and True` evaluates to `False`. The `raise Exception` is not executed.
3.  The next `if` condition is `if len(data) == 0:`.
    - `len([])` is `0`.
    - The condition `0 == 0` evaluates to `True`.
4.  The code inside this `if` block is executed: `return (0.0, [0.0])`.
5.  The function terminates and returns the tuple `(0.0, [0.0])`.

**Final Output:**
The function returns the tuple `(0.0, [0.0])`. I need to format this as JSON within the provided structure. A Python tuple is represented as a JSON array.

Therefore, the output will be `[0.0, [0.0]]`.
