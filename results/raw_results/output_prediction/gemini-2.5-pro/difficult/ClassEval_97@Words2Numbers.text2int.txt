[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to execute the `text2int` method of the `Words2Numbers` class with the given input.

**Function:** `text2int`
**Input `textnum`:** `"thirty-two"`

**Step-by-step execution:**

1.  **`__init__`**: The `self` object is already initialized as per the input JSON. It contains dictionaries mapping number words to their values (`numwords`), lists of units, tens, scales, and configurations for ordinal numbers.

2.  **`text2int("thirty-two")` is called.**

3.  **`textnum = textnum.replace('-', ' ')`**:
    -   The input `textnum` is "thirty-two".
    -   It becomes "thirty two".

4.  **Variable Initialization**:
    -   `current = 0`
    -   `result = 0`
    -   `curstring = ''`
    -   `onnumber = False`

5.  **`for word in textnum.split():`**:
    -   `textnum.split()` results in the list `['thirty', 'two']`.
    -   The loop will execute twice.

6.  **First Iteration: `word = "thirty"`**
    -   `if word in self.ordinal_words`: "thirty" is not in `self.ordinal_words`. The condition is false.
    -   The `else` block is executed.
    -   The inner loop for `ordinal_endings` does nothing as "thirty" doesn't end with "ieth" or "th".
    -   `if word not in self.numwords`: "thirty" is in `self.numwords` (key: "thirty", value: `[1, 30]`). The condition is false.
    -   The final `else` block is executed:
        -   `scale, increment = self.numwords[word]`: `scale` becomes `1`, `increment` becomes `30`.
        -   `current = current * scale + increment`: `current = 0 * 1 + 30` -> `current` is now `30`.
        -   `if scale > 100`: `1 > 100` is false.
        -   `onnumber = True`.

7.  **Second Iteration: `word = "two"`**
    -   `if word in self.ordinal_words`: "two" is not in `self.ordinal_words`. The condition is false.
    -   The `else` block is executed.
    -   The inner loop for `ordinal_endings` does nothing.
    -   `if word not in self.numwords`: "two" is in `self.numwords` (key: "two", value: `[1, 2]`). The condition is false.
    -   The final `else` block is executed:
        -   `scale, increment = self.numwords[word]`: `scale` becomes `1`, `increment` becomes `2`.
        -   `current = current * scale + increment`: `current = 30 * 1 + 2` -> `current` is now `32`.
        -   `if scale > 100`: `1 > 100` is false.
        -   `onnumber = True`.

8.  **End of the loop.**

9.  **`if onnumber:`**: The condition is `True`.
    -   `curstring += repr(result + current)`:
        -   `result + current` is `0 + 32 = 32`.
        -   `repr(32)` returns the string representation `'32'`.
        -   `curstring` becomes `'32'`.

10. **`return curstring`**: The function returns the value of `curstring`, which is `'32'`.

The final output is the string "32".
