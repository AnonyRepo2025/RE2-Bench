The user wants me to predict the output of a given Python script with a specific input.

**Step-by-step execution simulation:**

1.  **`x = int(input())`**: The script reads the input string "32" and converts it to an integer. So, `x` becomes `32`.

2.  **`l = factorization(x)`**: The `factorization` function is called with `n = 32`.
    *   `arr = []`
    *   `temp = 32`
    *   The `for` loop iterates from `i = 2` up to `int(-(-32**0.5 // 1)) + 1`.
        *   `32**0.5` is approximately `5.656`.
        *   `-(-5.656 // 1)` is `int(6.0)`, which is `6`.
        *   The loop range is `range(2, 7)`, so `i` will be `2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.
    *   **`i = 2`**:
        *   `temp % i == 0` (i.e., `32 % 2 == 0`) is true.
        *   `cnt` is initialized to `0`.
        *   The `while` loop starts:
            *   `cnt = 1`, `temp = 32 // 2 = 16`.
            *   `cnt = 2`, `temp = 16 // 2 = 8`.
            *   `cnt = 3`, `temp = 8 // 2 = 4`.
            *   `cnt = 4`, `temp = 4 // 2 = 2`.
            *   `cnt = 5`, `temp = 2 // 2 = 1`.
        *   The `while` loop terminates as `temp` is now `1`.
        *   `arr.append([2, 5])`. `arr` is now `[[2, 5]]`.
    *   **`i = 3`**: `temp % i == 0` (i.e., `1 % 3 == 0`) is false.
    *   **`i = 4`**: `temp % i == 0` (i.e., `1 % 4 == 0`) is false.
    *   **`i = 5`**: `temp % i == 0` (i.e., `1 % 5 == 0`) is false.
    *   **`i = 6`**: `temp % i == 0` (i.e., `1 % 6 == 0`) is false.
    *   The `for` loop finishes.
    *   `if temp != 1` (i.e., `1 != 1`) is false.
    *   `if arr == []` (i.e., `[[2, 5]] == []`) is false.
    *   The function returns `arr`, which is `[[2, 5]]`.
    *   So, `l` is assigned the value `[[2, 5]]`.

3.  **`l = sorted(l)`**: `l` is already sorted, so it remains `[[2, 5]]`.

4.  **`ans = 0`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `0`.

5.  **`for i in range(len(l))`**: The loop will run once for `i = 0` since `len(l)` is 1.
    *   **`i = 0`**:
        *   `l[i]` is `[2, 5]`.
        *   `if l[i][0] == 1` (i.e., `2 == 1`) is false.
        *   The `else` block is executed.
        *   `s = 0`.
        *   `num = l[i][1]`, so `num` becomes `5`.
        *   `if num == 1` (i.e., `5 == 1`) is false.
        *   The inner `else` block is executed.
        *   `for j in range(1, num)`: This is `for j in range(1, 5)`, so `j` will iterate through `1, 2, 3, 4`.
            *   **`j = 1`**:
                *   `s += j` -> `s` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
                *   `if s == num` (`1 == 5`) is false.
                *   `elif s > num` (`1 > 5`) is false.
            *   **`j = 2`**:
                *   `s += j` -> `s` becomes `1 + 2 = 3`.
                *   `if s == num` (`3 == 5`) is false.
                *   `elif s > num` (`3 > 5`) is false.
            *   **`j = 3`**:
                *   `s += j` -> `s` becomes `3 + 3 = 6`.
                *   `if s == num` (`6 == 5`) is false.
                *   `elif s > num` (`6 > 5`) is true.
                    *   `j -= 1` -> `j` becomes `2`.
                    *   `break`. The inner `for` loop terminates.
        *   The value of `j` after the loop is `2`.
        *   `ans += j` -> `ans` becomes `0 + 2 = 2`.

6.  The outer `for` loop finishes.

7.  **`print(ans)`**: The script prints the final value of `ans`.

The final value of `ans` is `2`. The output will be `2`.
