[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the final state of an `IncrementalPCA` object after calling its `fit` method.

**Function:** `IncrementalPCA.fit(self, X, y=None)`

**Inputs:**
- `self`: An `IncrementalPCA` instance with `n_components=None`, `whiten=False`, `copy=True`, `batch_size="38"`.
- `X`: A NumPy array of shape (100, 3).

**Step-by-step execution simulation:**

1.  **Initialization:** The `fit` method starts by resetting several attributes of the `self` object: `components_`, `n_samples_seen_`, `mean_`, `var_`, `singular_values_`, etc., are set to `None` or `0`.

2.  **Input Validation:** `X` is passed to `check_array`. Since `copy=True`, a copy of `X` is made. The shape is determined: `n_samples = 100`, `n_features = 3`.

3.  **Batch Size Setup:**
    - `self.batch_size` is not `None`; it's `"38"`.
    - The code will treat this string as an integer. `self.batch_size_` is set to `38`.

4.  **Batch Loop:** The code iterates over batches of `X`.
    - `gen_batches(n=100, batch_size=38, min_batch_size=0)` is called.
    - This will generate three batches:
        - Batch 1: `X[0:38]` (38 samples)
        - Batch 2: `X[38:76]` (38 samples)
        - Batch 3: `X[76:100]` (24 samples)
    - For each batch, `self.partial_fit(X_batch)` is called.

**`partial_fit` - Batch 1 (samples 0-38):**

1.  **State:** `n_samples_seen_` is 0, `components_` is `None`.
2.  **`n_components_` determination:** Since `self.n_components` is `None` and this is the first call, `self.n_components_` is set to `min(n_samples, n_features)`, which is `min(38, 3) = 3`.
3.  **Mean and Variance:** `_incremental_mean_and_var` is called with `last_sample_count=0`. It calculates the mean (`col_mean`) and variance (`col_var`) of this first batch. `n_total_samples` becomes 38.
4.  **Centering:** The batch data `X_batch` is centered by subtracting its own mean (`col_mean`).
5.  **SVD:** `linalg.svd` is performed on the centered `X_batch`. This yields `U`, `S`, and `V`.
6.  **Attribute Update:**
    - `self.n_samples_seen_` becomes 38.
    - `self.mean_` is set to `col_mean` of the first batch.
    - `self.var_` is set to `col_var` of the first batch.
    - `self.components_` is set to `V` (shape (3, 3)).
    - `self.singular_values_` is set to `S` (shape (3,)).
    - `self.explained_variance_` and `self.explained_variance_ratio_` are calculated based on `S`, `col_var`, and `n_total_samples`.
    - `self.noise_variance_` is set to `0.0` because `n_components_` (3) is not less than `n_features` (3).

**`partial_fit` - Batch 2 (samples 38-76):**

1.  **State:** `n_samples_seen_` is 38, `components_` is the result from the first batch.
2.  **Mean and Variance:** `_incremental_mean_and_var` is called again. It combines the stats from the first 38 samples (`self.mean_`, `self.var_`, `self.n_samples_seen_`) with the new batch of 38 samples. The new `col_mean`, `col_var` now represent the first 76 samples. `n_total_samples` becomes 76.
3.  **Data Augmentation:**
    - The current batch `X_batch` is centered using its *own* mean.
    - A `mean_correction` term is calculated.
    - A new matrix is constructed for SVD by stacking three parts:
        1.  The previous components scaled by the previous singular values (`self.singular_values_.reshape((-1, 1)) * self.components_`). This is a (3, 3) matrix.
        2.  The current centered batch `X_batch`. This is a (38, 3) matrix.
        3.  The `mean_correction` vector. This is a (1, 3) matrix.
    - The resulting matrix for SVD has a shape of (3 + 38 + 1, 3) = (42, 3).
4.  **SVD:** `linalg.svd` is performed on this new (42, 3) matrix.
5.  **Attribute Update:** All attributes (`mean_`, `var_`, `components_`, etc.) are updated with the new values calculated from the combined data of 76 samples. `self.n_samples_seen_` becomes 76.

**`partial_fit` - Batch 3 (samples 76-100):**

1.  **State:** `n_samples_seen_` is 76.
2.  **Mean and Variance:** The process repeats. `_incremental_mean_and_var` calculates the final mean and variance for all 100 samples. `n_total_samples` becomes 100.
3.  **Data Augmentation:**
    - The current batch `X_batch` (24 samples) is centered.
    - A new matrix is constructed for SVD:
        1.  Previous scaled components (3, 3).
        2.  Current centered batch (24, 3).
        3.  `mean_correction` vector (1, 3).
    - The resulting matrix for SVD has a shape of (3 + 24 + 1, 3) = (28, 3).
4.  **SVD:** `linalg.svd` is performed on this (28, 3) matrix.
5.  **Final Attribute Update:** The attributes are updated for the last time. These will be the final values after the `fit` method completes.
    - `self.n_samples_seen_` will be 100.
    - `self.mean_`, `self.var_`, `self.components_`, etc., will hold the final computed values for the entire dataset.

**Final Values Calculation:**
By running the simulation with the provided data, we get the following final values for the object's attributes.

-   **`n_components`**: `null` (unchanged from input)
-   **`whiten`**: `false` (unchanged from input)
-   **`copy`**: `true` (unchanged from input)
-   **`batch_size`**: `"38"` (unchanged from input)
-   **`components_`**: The principal axes in feature space. A (3, 3) array.
-   **`n_samples_seen_`**: `100`
-   **`mean_`**: The per-feature empirical mean over all 100 samples. A (3,) array.
-   **`var_`**: The per-feature empirical variance over all 100 samples. A (3,) array.
-   **`singular_values_`**: The singular values corresponding to each of the selected components. A (3,) array.
-   **`explained_variance_`**: The amount of variance explained by each of the selected components. A (3,) array.
-   **`explained_variance_ratio_`**: Percentage of variance explained by each of the selected components. A (3,) array.
-   **`noise_variance_`**: `0.0` (since `n_components_ == n_features`)
-   **`batch_size_`**: `38` (set during `fit`)
-   **`n_components_`**: `3` (determined during the first `partial_fit`)

The exact numerical values are calculated and formatted into the final JSON output.
