[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `Expr.__eq__` method.

**Function:** `Expr.__eq__(self, other)`
**Inputs:**
- `self`: An instance of the `Expr` class. The input shows `{}` which implies a default-constructed instance.
- `other`: The string `"picoweber"`.

Let's trace the execution step-by-step:

1.  The `__eq__` method of the `Expr` class is called with `self` being an `Expr` instance and `other` being the string `"picoweber"`.

2.  The first line inside the method is a `try...except` block: `try: other = _sympify(other)`.

3.  The function `_sympify("picoweber")` is called.

4.  Inside `_sympify(a)`, it calls `sympify(a, strict=True)`. So, `sympify("picoweber", strict=True)` is executed.

5.  Let's trace `sympify(a="picoweber", strict=True)`:
    *   `a` is a string, so it doesn't have a `__sympy__` attribute.
    *   It's not an instance of `CantSympify`.
    *   The `converter` dictionary does not have an entry for the `str` type.
    *   The `getmro` loop for `str` also won't find a converter.
    *   `a` is not `None`.
    *   `evaluate` defaults to `True`.
    *   `a` is not a numpy type.
    *   `a` does not have a `_sympy_` method.
    *   The `if not strict:` block is skipped because `strict` is `True`.
    *   The code proceeds. `isinstance(a, string_types)` is `True`. The `for coerce in (float, int):` loop is skipped because the code for strings comes later.
    *   The next check is `if strict: raise SympifyError(a)`. Since `strict` is `True`, and the string `"picoweber"` has not been converted yet, a `SympifyError` is raised with the expression `"picoweber"`. The parsing logic at the end of `sympify` is only reachable if `strict` is `False`.

6.  Back in the `Expr.__eq__` method, the `try` block catches this `SympifyError`.

7.  The `except (SympifyError, SyntaxError):` block is executed.

8.  Inside the `except` block, the statement `return False` is executed.

Therefore, the function `Expr.__eq__` returns `False`. The string `"picoweber"` cannot be "sympified" in strict mode, so it is considered not equal to any `Expr` object.
