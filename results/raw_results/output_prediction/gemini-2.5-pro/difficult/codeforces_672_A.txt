[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the given Python script for a specific input.

**Code Execution Analysis:**

1.  **Initialization:** An empty list `li` is created.
2.  **Loop (1 to 370):** The code iterates through numbers from `i = 1` to `i = 370`.
3.  **List Population:** Inside the loop, the code determines the number of digits in `i`.
    *   If `i` has 1 digit (1-9), the number `i` itself is appended to `li`.
    *   If `i` has 2 digits (10-99), the digits of `i` are extracted and appended to `li` in order. For example, for `i=12`, `1` and `2` are appended.
    *   If `i` has 3 digits (100-370), the digits of `i` are extracted and appended to `li` in order. For example, for `i=123`, `1`, `2`, and `3` are appended.
4.  **Resulting List `li` (before pops):** After the loop finishes, `li` will contain a sequence of digits formed by concatenating the numbers 1 through 370.
    *   `li` will look like: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, ..., 3, 6, 9, 3, 7, 0]`
5.  **`li.pop()` calls:**
    *   The first `li.pop()` removes the last element, which is `0` (from the number 370).
    *   The second `li.pop()` removes the new last element, which is `7` (from the number 370).
    *   The list `li` now ends with `..., 3, 6, 9, 3`.
6.  **Input:** The script reads an integer from the input. The provided input is `423`. So, `n` becomes `423`.
7.  **Output:** The script prints the element at index `n - 1` of the list `li`. This is `li[423 - 1]`, which is `li[422]`.

**Finding the element at index 422:**

I need to determine what the 423rd element (at index 422) of the generated sequence is.

*   **1-digit numbers (1-9):** These contribute 9 numbers, taking up indices 0 to 8.
    *   `422 > 8`, so the element is not in this range.
    *   Digits so far: 9.

*   **2-digit numbers (10-99):** There are 90 such numbers. Each contributes 2 digits.
    *   Total digits from this range: `90 * 2 = 180`.
    *   Total digits from 1- and 2-digit numbers: `9 + 180 = 189`.
    *   These digits occupy indices 0 to 188.
    *   `422 > 188`, so the element is not in this range either.

*   **3-digit numbers (100 onwards):** The element we are looking for is in this range.
    *   Let's find the index relative to the start of the 3-digit numbers. The 3-digit numbers start at index 189.
    *   `relative_index = 422 - 189 = 233`.
    *   We need to find the 234th digit (since `relative_index` is 0-based) in the sequence of digits from numbers 100, 101, 102, ...
    *   Each number contributes 3 digits. To find which number contains our target digit, we can divide the relative index by 3.
    *   `number_offset = 233 // 3 = 77`. This means our digit is in the number that is 77 positions after the first 3-digit number (100).
    *   The number is `100 + 77 = 177`.
    *   To find which digit within the number 177 it is, we use the modulo operator.
    *   `digit_index = 233 % 3 = 2`.
    *   This means we need the digit at index 2 (the 3rd digit) of the number 177.
    *   The digits of 177 are `1`, `7`, `7`.
    *   The digit at index 2 is `7`.

Therefore, `li[422]` is `7`. The script will print `7`.
The `pop` operations do not affect this result, as they remove elements from the very end of the list, and we are accessing an element much earlier in the list (index 422). The total length of the list before popping is `9 + 180 + (271 * 3) = 1002`.
