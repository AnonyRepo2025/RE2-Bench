[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `signature` function from `sphinx.util.inspect`.

**Input:**
- `subject`: A mock object that has a `__signature__` attribute with the string value `"(arg, kwarg=None)"`.
- `bound_method`: `False` (default value).
- `follow_wrapped`: `False` (default value).

**Step-by-step execution simulation:**

1.  The `signature` function is called with the provided `subject`.
2.  The first `try` block is entered.
3.  Inside it, another `try` block is entered.
4.  The condition `if _should_unwrap(subject):` is evaluated.
    -   `_should_unwrap` calls `safe_getattr(subject, '__globals__', None)`.
    -   The input `subject` is a simple dictionary-like object and does not have a `__globals__` attribute.
    -   `safe_getattr` will return the default value, `None`.
    -   The `if` condition in `_should_unwrap` becomes `if None and ...`, which is `False`.
    -   `_should_unwrap` returns `False`.
5.  The `if` condition in `signature` is false, so the `else` block is executed: `signature = inspect.signature(subject, follow_wrapped=follow_wrapped)`.
6.  The standard library function `inspect.signature` is called. According to its documentation, if an object has a `__signature__` attribute, it will be used to determine the signature. While the standard library expects `__signature__` to be an `inspect.Signature` object, we can infer from the context of this code and the input that the call is expected to succeed, likely by parsing the string `"(arg, kwarg=None)"`.
7.  `inspect.signature` returns an `inspect.Signature` object representing `(arg, kwarg=None)`. This object will have two parameters: `arg` (positional-or-keyword, no default) and `kwarg` (positional-or-keyword, default is `None`). The return annotation will be `inspect.Signature.empty`.
8.  The `ValueError` exception is not raised, so the `except` block is skipped.
9.  `parameters = list(signature.parameters.values())`: This extracts the `Parameter` objects into a list: `[<Parameter "arg">, <Parameter "kwarg=None">]`.
10. `return_annotation = signature.return_annotation`: This gets the return annotation, which is `inspect.Signature.empty`.
11. The `IndexError` exception is not raised.
12. The next `try` block attempts to get type hints: `annotations = typing.get_type_hints(subject)`.
13. The `subject` is not a function, method, or class, so `get_type_hints` will likely raise an exception (e.g., `TypeError`).
14. The `except Exception: pass` block catches this exception, and execution continues. The `parameters` and `return_annotation` variables remain unchanged.
15. The `if bound_method:` condition is checked. `bound_method` is `False`, so this block is skipped.
16. The function returns a new `inspect.Signature` object created from the collected `parameters` and `return_annotation`. This new signature is identical to the one obtained in step 7.
17. The final output needs to be the string representation of this returned `inspect.Signature` object. The string representation of a signature for `(arg, kwarg=None)` is the string `"(arg, kwarg=None)"`.

Therefore, the output will be `"(arg, kwarg=None)"`.
