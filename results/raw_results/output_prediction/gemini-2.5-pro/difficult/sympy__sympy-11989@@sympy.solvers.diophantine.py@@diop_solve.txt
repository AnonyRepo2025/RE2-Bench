[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the `diop_solve` function call:**
    The function `diop_solve` is called with `eq="2*x - 3*y - 5"`. The `param` argument defaults to `t = symbols('t', integer=True)`.

2.  **Trace `diop_solve` execution:**
    *   The first step inside `diop_solve` is to call `classify_diop(eq, _dict=False)`.
    *   The input `eq` is a string. SymPy functions typically operate on SymPy expressions. It's standard for them to implicitly call `sympify` on string inputs. So, `eq` becomes the expression `2*x - 3*y - 5`.

3.  **Trace `classify_diop(2*x - 3*y - 5, _dict=False)`:**
    *   `var = list(eq.free_symbols)`: The free symbols in the expression are `x` and `y`. `eq.free_symbols` returns `{x, y}`. `var` becomes a list, e.g., `[x, y]` or `[y, x]`.
    *   `var.sort(key=default_sort_key)`: The variables are sorted. Alphabetically, `x` comes before `y`. So, `var` is `[x, y]`.
    *   `eq = eq.expand(force=True)`: The expression is already expanded, so it remains `2*x - 3*y - 5`.
    *   `coeff = eq.as_coefficients_dict()`: This extracts the coefficients of the terms. The result is a dictionary: `{x: 2, y: -3, 1: -5}`.
    *   `total_degree = Poly(eq).total_degree()`: The polynomial is `2*x - 3*y - 5`. The highest degree of any term is 1. So, `total_degree` is 1.
    *   `if total_degree == 1:`: This condition is true.
    *   `diop_type = 'linear'`.
    *   The function returns the tuple `(var, coeff, diop_type)`, which is `([x, y], {x: 2, y: -3, 1: -5}, 'linear')`. Note that `_dict=False` means `coeff` is a `defaultdict`, but its contents are the same.

4.  **Resume `diop_solve` execution:**
    *   `var` is `[x, y]`.
    *   `coeff` is `{x: 2, y: -3, 1: -5}`.
    *   `eq_type` is `'linear'`.
    *   The code checks `if eq_type == 'linear':`, which is true.
    *   It then calls `return _diop_linear(var, coeff, param)`.

5.  **Simulate `_diop_linear(var, coeff, param)`:**
    *   This internal function solves linear Diophantine equations. The equation is of the form `a*x + b*y + ... = 0`.
    *   From `coeff`, we have `a = coeff[x] = 2`, `b = coeff[y] = -3`, and the constant term is `-5`.
    *   The equation to solve is `2*x - 3*y - 5 = 0`, or `2*x - 3*y = 5`.
    *   First, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients of the variables: `d = gcd(2, -3) = 1`.
    *   A solution exists if `d` divides the constant term (on the right side). Here, `1` divides `5`, so integer solutions exist.
    *   Next, use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (`igcdex`) to find a particular solution `(x_p, y_p)` for `2*x - 3*y = d = 1`.
    *   `igcdex(2, -3)` returns `(1, -1, -1)`, which means `2*(-1) + (-3)*(-1) = 1`. So, a particular solution is `x_p = -1`, `y_p = -1`.
    *   To find a particular solution `(x_0, y_0)` for the original equation `2*x - 3*y = 5`, we multiply `(x_p, y_p)` by `5/d = 5/1 = 5`.
    *   `x_0 = x_p * 5 = -1 * 5 = -5`.
    *   `y_0 = y_p * 5 = -1 * 5 = -5`.
    *   Check: `2*(-5) - 3*(-5) = -10 + 15 = 5`. This is a correct particular solution.
    *   The general solution is given by:
        *   `x = x_0 + (b/d) * t = -5 + (-3/1) * t = -5 - 3*t`
        *   `y = y_0 - (a/d) * t = -5 - (2/1) * t = -5 - 2*t`
        where `t` is the integer parameter `param`.
    *   The function returns a set containing a tuple of the solutions for `(x, y)` in the order determined by `var`. Since `var` was `[x, y]`, the tuple is `(-3*t - 5, -2*t - 5)`.
    *   The return value is `{(-3*t - 5, -2*t - 5)}`.

6.  **Final Output Formatting:**
    *   The `diop_solve` function returns the set object.
    *   The framework will convert this return value to a string to fill the `XXX` placeholder.
    *   The string representation of the set `{(-3*t - 5, -2*t - 5)}` is `"{(-3*t - 5, -2*t - 5)}"`.
