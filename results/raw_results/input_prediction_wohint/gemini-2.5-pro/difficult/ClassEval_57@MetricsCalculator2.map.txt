[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the input for the `map` function that results in the output `[0.0, [0.0]]`.

1.  **Analyze the Output:** The output is a JSON array `[0.0, [0.0]]`. In Python, this corresponds to a tuple `(0.0, [0.0])`. The first element is the mean average precision (MAP), and the second is a list of the individual average precisions (APs).

2.  **Analyze the `map` function's logic:** The function handles different types of input for the `data` parameter.
    *   If `data` is an empty list or tuple (`len(data) == 0`), it directly returns `(0.0, [0.0])`. This is a possible solution. For example, `data = []`.
    *   If `data` is a single tuple `(sub_list, total_num)`, it calculates a single AP. If `total_num` is 0, it returns `(0.0, [0.0])`. This is another possible solution. For example, `data = ([], 0)`.
    *   If `data` is a list of tuples `[(sub_list_1, total_num_1), ...]`, it calculates an AP for each tuple, collects them in `separate_result`, and returns the mean and the list itself.

3.  **Find an input that produces the target output:** I need to find an input `data` such that the function returns `(0.0, [0.0])`.
    *   This means the list of calculated APs (`separate_result`) must be `[0.0]`.
    *   This, in turn, means the input `data` must be a list containing a single tuple `(sub_list, total_num)`, and the AP calculated for this tuple must be `0.0`.

4.  **How to get an AP of 0.0?** Looking at the code for the list-of-tuples case:
    ```python
    for sub_list, total_num in data:
        ...
        if total_num == 0:
            ap = 0.0
        else:
            # ... calculation ...
            ap = np.sum(...) / total_num
        separate_result.append(ap)
    ```
    The easiest way to get `ap = 0.0` is to have `total_num = 0`.

5.  **Construct the input:**
    *   Let's make `data` a list with one element: `data = [(...)]`.
    *   This element should be a tuple `(sub_list, total_num)`.
    *   To make `ap = 0.0`, let's set `total_num = 0`.
    *   The `sub_list` can be anything, as it won't be used in the calculation when `total_num` is 0. Let's pick a simple non-empty list, for example, `[1, 0]`.
    *   So, a valid input is `data = [([1, 0], 0)]`.

6.  **Step-by-step simulation with the chosen input `data = [([1, 0], 0)]`:**
    *   The function `map` is called with `data = [([1, 0], 0)]`.
    *   `type(data)` is `list`, so the code enters the `if type(data) == list:` block.
    *   `separate_result` is initialized as `[]`.
    *   The `for` loop starts. It will run once for the tuple `([1, 0], 0)`.
    *   Inside the loop, `sub_list` is `[1, 0]` and `total_num` is `0`.
    *   The condition `if total_num == 0:` is true.
    *   `ap` is set to `0.0`.
    *   `separate_result.append(0.0)`. Now, `separate_result` is `[0.0]`.
    *   The loop finishes.
    *   The function returns `(np.mean(separate_result), separate_result)`.
    *   `np.mean([0.0])` is `0.0`.
    *   The final return value is `(0.0, [0.0])`.
    *   This matches the desired output.

This input is a good choice as it exercises the main logic of the function (the list processing loop) rather than just the initial edge case guards.
