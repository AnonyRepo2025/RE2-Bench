[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The user wants the input for the Python function `Application._eval_subs` that results in the output `"2*x"`.

2.  **Analyze the Target Function `_eval_subs`:**
    ```python
    def _eval_subs(self, old, new):
        if old.is_Function and new.is_Function and callable(old) and callable(new) and (old == self.func) and (len(self.args) in new.nargs):
            return new(*[i._subs(old, new) for i in self.args])
    ```
    - The function is a method of the `Application` class, which is a base class for functions in SymPy. `self` will be an instance of a function application, like `f(x)`.
    - It has a single `if` block. If the condition is not met, it implicitly returns `None`.
    - If `_eval_subs` returns `None`, the calling function `Basic._subs` will use a fallback mechanism that typically only substitutes within the arguments, e.g., `f(y)._subs(y, z)` becomes `f(z)`. This would not produce the bare expression `2*x` from a function application `f(...)`.
    - Therefore, the `if` condition *must* be true, and the `return` statement must be executed.

3.  **Deconstruct the `if` Condition:**
    - `old.is_Function` and `new.is_Function`: Both `old` and `new` must be SymPy Function classes (or objects that behave like them).
    - `callable(old)` and `callable(new)`: They must be callable, which function classes are.
    - `old == self.func`: The `old` object must be the very function class of the `self` instance. This is the key to substituting the head of a function application. For example, if `self` is `f(x)`, then `self.func` is `f`, so `old` must be `f`.
    - `len(self.args) in new.nargs`: The number of arguments in `self` must be a valid number of arguments for the `new` function.

4.  **Analyze the `return` Statement:**
    - `return new(*[i._subs(old, new) for i in self.args])`
    - This statement constructs a new function application using the `new` function class.
    - The arguments for this new application are the result of substituting `old` for `new` within the original arguments of `self`.
    - Let's assume a simple case where the original arguments do not contain `old`. For `self = f(x)`, `old = f`, `new = g`, the arguments are `(x,)`. `x._subs(f, g)` just returns `x`. The expression returned is `g(x)`.

5.  **Connect to the Output `2*x`:**
    - The `_eval_subs` method must return an object that evaluates or simplifies to `2*x`.
    - Based on the previous step, the method returns `g(x)`.
    - How does a function application `g(x)` become `2*x`? This happens during the object's creation, via the `Application.__new__` method.
    - `Application.__new__` calls `cls.eval(*args)`. If `eval` returns a value other than `None`, that value is returned instead of the function application object.
    - Therefore, `g.eval(x)` must return `2*x`.

6.  **Formulate the Input Objects:**
    - We need a symbol `x`. Let's use `Symbol('x')`.
    - We need a placeholder function class `f`. `Function('f')` works.
    - We need the `self` object, which is an application of `f`. Let's use `f(x)`. So `self = Function('f')(Symbol('x'))`.
    - We need the `old` object, which must be `self.func`. So `old = Function('f')`.
    - We need the `new` object, which is a function class `g` with a special `eval` method. Let's call it `g`. `g` must be a `Function` class where `g.eval(arg)` returns `2 * arg`.
    - We also need to satisfy `len(self.args) in new.nargs`. `self` is `f(x)`, so `len(self.args)` is 1. Thus, `g` must accept one argument, so we can define `g.nargs = 1`.

7.  **Synthesize the Final Input:**
    - `self`: An instance of a function application `f(x)`. In terms of object properties, this is an object whose `func` is the class `f` and whose `_args` is a tuple containing the symbol `x`.
    - `old`: The function class `f`.
    - `new`: A function class `g` that has the property `nargs=1` and an `eval` method that doubles its argument.

8.  **Predict the JSON Input:**
    - The problem requires a JSON representation. Since I cannot define a new Python class with a custom method within JSON, I must assume that the testing environment provides the necessary function classes `f` and `g` (with its special `eval` behavior).
    - The JSON input will describe the arguments `self`, `old`, and `new` by referring to these predefined components.
    - `self` is an instance of `f` with argument `x`. I'll represent it by its attributes. Its `func` is `old`, and its `args` contains `x`.
    - `old` is the function class `f`.
    - `new` is the function class `g`.
    - To make the JSON self-contained and avoid circular references, I will represent the objects using a structure that SymPy's `sympify` can likely understand. I'll define `old` and `new` as function classes by name, and `self` as an application of `old` on a symbol `x`.

    - `old`: A function class, let's call it `f`.
    - `new`: A function class, let's call it `g`, which is configured to double its argument.
    - `self`: The application `f(x)`.

    The JSON will represent these structures.
    - `old`: `{"__class__": "Function", "name": "f"}`
    - `new`: `{"__class__": "Function", "name": "g_doubler"}` (assuming `g_doubler` is a known type in the test harness that has the `eval` logic).
    - `self`: `{"__class__": "f", "_args": [{"__class__": "Symbol", "name": "x"}]}`. This assumes `f` can be resolved as a class.

    A simpler representation, closer to the example, would be to describe the properties of the objects that are actually accessed by the code.

    - `self`: An object with a `func` property (which is `old`) and an `args` property (a tuple containing `x`).
    - `old`: An object that is a callable `Function` class.
    - `new`: An object that is a callable `Function` class with `nargs` including 1, and whose `eval` method doubles its argument.

    Given the ambiguity, the most reasonable approach is to specify the components clearly. I'll define `old` and `new` as distinct function classes and `self` as an application of `old`. The key is the relationship between them.
