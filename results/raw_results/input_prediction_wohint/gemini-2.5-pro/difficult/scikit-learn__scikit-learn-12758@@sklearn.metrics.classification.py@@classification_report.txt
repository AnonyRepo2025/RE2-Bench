1.  **Analyze the Output:** The user has provided a classification report as a formatted string. I need to extract all the numerical data and labels from it.

    *   **Classes and Support:**
        *   `blue`: support = 24
        *   `green`: support = 31
        *   `red`: support = 20
        *   Total samples = 24 + 31 + 20 = 75. This is confirmed by the support value for the averaged scores.

    *   **Per-Class Metrics (Precision, Recall):**
        *   `blue`: P=0.83, R=0.79
        *   `green`: P=0.33, R=0.10
        *   `red`: P=0.42, R=0.90

    *   **Overall Accuracy:** 0.53

2.  **Reverse-Engineer the Confusion Matrix:** The goal is to find a confusion matrix that produces these metrics. Let the classes be `blue=0`, `green=1`, `red=2`. The confusion matrix `C` will have `C[i, j]` as the count of samples with true label `i` and predicted label `j`.

    *   The support for a class is the total number of true instances of that class. `Support = TP + FN`.
    *   Recall is `TP / (TP + FN)`.
    *   Precision is `TP / (TP + FP)`.

    Let's calculate the True Positives (TP) for each class:
    *   `TP_blue = Recall_blue * Support_blue = 0.79 * 24 = 18.96`. Rounding to the nearest integer gives `TP_blue = 19`.
    *   `TP_green = Recall_green * Support_green = 0.10 * 31 = 3.1`. Rounding gives `TP_green = 3`.
    *   `TP_red = Recall_red * Support_red = 0.90 * 20 = 18`. This is an integer.

    Now, let's find False Negatives (FN) and False Positives (FP):
    *   **For 'blue':**
        *   `TP = 19`, `Support = 24` => `FN = 24 - 19 = 5`.
        *   `Precision = 0.83 = TP / (TP + FP) = 19 / (19 + FP)`.
        *   `19 / 0.83 = 19 + FP` => `22.89 = 19 + FP` => `FP = 3.89`. Rounding gives `FP = 4`.
        *   *Check*: P = 19/23 = 0.826 (rounds to 0.83), R = 19/24 = 0.791 (rounds to 0.79). This works.

    *   **For 'green':**
        *   `TP = 3`, `Support = 31` => `FN = 31 - 3 = 28`.
        *   `Precision = 0.33 = 3 / (3 + FP)`.
        *   `3 / 0.33 = 3 + FP` => `9.09 = 3 + FP` => `FP = 6.09`. Rounding gives `FP = 6`.
        *   *Check*: P = 3/9 = 0.333 (rounds to 0.33), R = 3/31 = 0.096 (rounds to 0.10). This works.

    *   **For 'red':**
        *   `TP = 18`, `Support = 20` => `FN = 20 - 18 = 2`.
        *   `Precision = 0.42 = 18 / (18 + FP)`.
        *   `18 / 0.42 = 18 + FP` => `42.85 = 18 + FP` => `FP = 24.85`. Rounding gives `FP = 25`.
        *   *Check*: P = 18/43 = 0.418 (rounds to 0.42), R = 18/20 = 0.90. This works.

3.  **Assemble the Matrix:** Now we build the matrix `C` using these values. The diagonal is `[19, 3, 18]`. The off-diagonal elements must sum to the calculated FN and FP values.

    *   `C[0,0]=19`, `C[1,1]=3`, `C[2,2]=18`.
    *   `FN_blue = C[0,1] + C[0,2] = 5`
    *   `FN_green = C[1,0] + C[1,2] = 28`
    *   `FN_red = C[2,0] + C[2,1] = 2`
    *   `FP_blue = C[1,0] + C[2,0] = 4`
    *   `FP_green = C[0,1] + C[2,1] = 6`
    *   `FP_red = C[0,2] + C[1,2] = 25`

    Solving this system of equations:
    1.  From `FP_blue` and `FN_red`, let's try `C[2,0] = 0`. This implies `C[1,0] = 4` and `C[2,1] = 2`.
    2.  From `FP_green`, `C[0,1] + C[2,1] = 6` => `C[0,1] + 2 = 6` => `C[0,1] = 4`.
    3.  From `FN_blue`, `C[0,1] + C[0,2] = 5` => `4 + C[0,2] = 5` => `C[0,2] = 1`.
    4.  From `FN_green`, `C[1,0] + C[1,2] = 28` => `4 + C[1,2] = 28` => `C[1,2] = 24`.
    5.  Final consistency check with `FP_red`: `C[0,2] + C[1,2] = 1 + 24 = 25`. This matches.

    The resulting confusion matrix is:
    ```
           Pred_B  Pred_G  Pred_R
    True_B    19       4       1     (Sum=24)
    True_G     4       3      24     (Sum=31)
    True_R     0       2      18     (Sum=20)
    ```
    The total number of correct predictions (diagonal) is 19 + 3 + 18 = 40.
    Accuracy = 40 / 75 = 0.5333..., which rounds to 0.53. This matches the report.

4.  **Construct `y_true` and `y_pred`:** Based on the confusion matrix, we can construct the input arrays. Using string labels is the most direct way to match the output report without needing to specify `target_names`.

    *   **`y_true`**: Contains the number of instances for each class as given by the 'support' column.
        *   24 instances of 'blue'
        *   31 instances of 'green'
        *   20 instances of 'red'
        *   `y_true = ['blue'] * 24 + ['green'] * 31 + ['red'] * 20`

    *   **`y_pred`**: Contains the predicted labels corresponding to each true label, based on the confusion matrix rows.
        *   For the 24 true 'blue's: 19 were predicted 'blue', 4 'green', 1 'red'.
        *   For the 31 true 'green's: 4 were predicted 'blue', 3 'green', 24 'red'.
        *   For the 20 true 'red's: 0 were predicted 'blue', 2 'green', 18 'red'.
        *   `y_pred = (['blue'] * 19 + ['green'] * 4 + ['red'] * 1) + \
                     (['blue'] * 4 + ['green'] * 3 + ['red'] * 24) + \
                     (['green'] * 2 + ['red'] * 18)`

5.  **Final Input:** The function `classification_report` takes `y_true` and `y_pred` as its main arguments. The other arguments like `digits` and `output_dict` have defaults that match the desired output, so they don't need to be specified. Using string labels for the arrays means `target_names` is also not required, as the default behavior will sort the unique labels alphabetically (`blue`, `green`, `red`), which matches the report's order.

    The final input will be a JSON object containing these two arrays as positional arguments.
