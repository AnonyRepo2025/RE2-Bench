[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to reverse the execution of the `split_super_sub` function to find the input `text` that produces the output `['alpha', ['+'], ['1']]`.

Let's analyze the target output:
- The first element of the returned tuple is the `name`: `"alpha"`.
- The second element is the `supers` list: `['+']`.
- The third element is the `subs` list: `['1']`.

Now, let's examine the function's logic to see how these components are generated from the input `text`.

1.  **Parsing `supers`**: The `supers` list contains `'+'`. This can be generated in two ways within the loop:
    *   From a part `^+`, where `part[1:]` is `'+'`.
    *   From a part `__+`, where `part[2:]` is `'+'`.
    Let's assume the simpler `^+` for now.

2.  **Parsing `subs` and `name`**: This is the most interesting part. The `subs` list contains `'1'`, and the final `name` is `"alpha"`. There are two ways to get a subscript:
    *   **Method A (Standard Subscript)**: A part `_1` is parsed in the loop. This would add `'1'` to the `subs` list. In this case, the initial `name` part parsed from the text would have to be `"alpha"`.
    *   **Method B (Regex on Name)**: After the loop, the code checks if the parsed `name` matches the regex `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$`. If it does, it splits the `name` into an alphabetic part and a numeric part. The numeric part is then inserted at the beginning of the `subs` list.

Let's explore both methods to construct the input `text`.

**Scenario A: Using standard subscript `_1`**
- To get `name="alpha"`, the first part of the text must be `alpha`.
- To get `supers=['+']`, a `^+` part must follow.
- To get `subs=['1']`, a `_1` part must follow.
- Combining these, a possible input `text` could be `"alpha^+_1"`.
- Let's trace this:
    - Loop 1: `part` = `"alpha"`. `name` becomes `"alpha"`.
    - Loop 2: `part` = `"^+"`. `supers` becomes `['+']`.
    - Loop 3: `part` = `"_1"`. `subs` becomes `['1']`.
    - Post-loop: `name` is `"alpha"`. The regex does not match.
    - Return: `('alpha', ['+'], ['1'])`. This works.

**Scenario B: Using the regex on the name**
- To get `subs=['1']` from the regex, the initial `name` parsed by the loop must end in `1`.
- To get the final `name="alpha"`, the initial `name` must have been `"alpha1"`.
- So, the first part of the text must be `alpha1`.
- To get `supers=['+']`, a `^+` part must follow.
- The `subs` list would be empty from the loop's perspective.
- Combining these, a possible input `text` could be `"alpha1^+"`.
- Let's trace this:
    - Loop 1: `part` = `"alpha1"`. `name` becomes `"alpha1"`.
    - Loop 2: `part` = `"^+"`. `supers` becomes `['+']`.
    - Post-loop: `name` is `"alpha1"`. The regex `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$` matches.
        - `m.groups()` returns `('alpha', '1')`.
        - `name` is updated to `"alpha"`.
        - `'1'` is inserted at the beginning of the `subs` list, which was empty. `subs` becomes `['1']`.
    - Return: `('alpha', ['+'], ['1'])`. This also works.

**Conclusion**
Both `"alpha^+_1"` and `"alpha1^+"` produce the correct output. However, the presence of the specific regex `_name_with_digits_p` suggests that parsing names with trailing digits (like `alpha1`) is a primary feature of this function. Therefore, `"alpha1^+"` is a more direct and likely intended input to test this feature. It's also more concise. I will predict this as the input.

The input to the function is a single string argument `text`.
