The user wants me to find the input for the `text2int` function that results in the output `"32"`.

1.  **Analyze the `text2int` function:**
    *   The function takes a string `textnum` which represents a number in English words.
    *   It processes the string word by word.
    *   It uses a dictionary `self.numwords` to convert words like 'one', 'twenty', 'hundred' into numerical values.
    *   The logic accumulates the number in two variables: `current` and `result`.
    *   `current` holds the value of the current number phrase being built (e.g., "three hundred fifty").
    *   `result` accumulates the total when a large scale word like 'thousand' or 'million' is encountered.
    *   The core calculation for a number word is `current = current * scale + increment`.
    *   Finally, it returns the string representation of the calculated number `result + current`.

2.  **Reverse the process for the output `"32"`:**
    *   The output is the string `"32"`. This means the final calculated value `result + current` must be the integer `32`.
    *   Since 32 is less than 100, it's likely that `result` remained `0` throughout the process and the final value was entirely in `current`.
    *   So, we need to find an English word representation that evaluates to `current = 32`.
    *   The number 32 is composed of "thirty" (30) and "two" (2).
    *   Let's trace the input `"thirty-two"`.

3.  **Simulate the execution with `textnum = "thirty-two"`:**
    *   `textnum = textnum.replace('-', ' ')` becomes `"thirty two"`.
    *   The input is split into `['thirty', 'two']`.
    *   Initialize `current = 0`, `result = 0`.
    *   **First word: "thirty"**
        *   The code looks up "thirty" in `self.numwords`.
        *   `self.numwords['thirty']` is `(1, 30)`. So, `scale = 1`, `increment = 30`.
        *   `current = current * scale + increment` -> `current = 0 * 1 + 30` -> `current` becomes `30`.
    *   **Second word: "two"**
        *   The code looks up "two" in `self.numwords`.
        *   `self.numwords['two']` is `(1, 2)`. So, `scale = 1`, `increment = 2`.
        *   `current = current * scale + increment` -> `current = 30 * 1 + 2` -> `current` becomes `32`.
    *   **End of loop:**
        *   The loop finishes.
        *   The final value is `result + current` which is `0 + 32 = 32`.
        *   The function returns `repr(32)`, which is the string `"32"`.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    *   The simulation confirms that the input `textnum = "thirty-two"` produces the output `"32"`. The input could also be `"thirty two"`, but the hyphenated form is more standard for compound numbers.

Therefore, the input to the `text2int` function is `{"textnum": "thirty-two"}`.
