[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to reverse-engineer the input to the `mrr` function given its output.

1.  **Analyze the Output:** The output is `[0.25, [0.25]]`. In Python, this would be a tuple `(0.25, [0.25])`. The function `mrr` returns a tuple `(mean_mrr, separate_results)`. This means the mean MRR is `0.25`, and the list of individual MRR scores is `[0.25]`. Since there's only one score in the list, the input `data` must have been either a single tuple or a list containing just one tuple.

2.  **Analyze the `mrr` function's logic:**
    *   The function calculates the Mean Reciprocal Rank. The reciprocal rank is `1/k`, where `k` is the rank (position) of the first relevant item.
    *   The core calculation involves `ranking_array = 1.0 / (np.array(list(range(len(sub_list)))) + 1)`. This creates an array of reciprocal ranks: `[1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...]`, i.e., `[1.0, 0.5, 0.333..., 0.25, ...]`.
    *   It then calculates `mr_np = sub_list * ranking_array`. The `sub_list` is expected to be a list of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates a relevant item.
    *   The code then finds the first non-zero value in `mr_np`. This value is the reciprocal rank of the first relevant item.

3.  **Deduce the Input from the Output:**
    *   The calculated MRR score is `0.25`.
    *   `0.25` is equal to `1/4`.
    *   This means the first relevant item must be at the 4th position (rank 4).
    *   In a zero-indexed list, the 4th position is at index `3`.
    *   To achieve this, the `sub_list` must have `0`s for the first three positions (indices 0, 1, 2) and a `1` at the fourth position (index 3).
    *   So, a possible `sub_list` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]`.
    *   Let's test this:
        *   `sub_list` = `[0, 0, 0, 1]`
        *   `ranking_array` would be `[1.0, 0.5, 0.333..., 0.25]`
        *   `mr_np = [0, 0, 0, 1] * [1.0, 0.5, 0.333..., 0.25]` = `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25]`
        *   The first non-zero element in `mr_np` is `0.25`. This is the correct `mr` value.

4.  **Construct the full `data` argument:**
    *   The function takes `data` which can be a tuple `(sub_list, total_num)` or a list of such tuples.
    *   The `total_num` value is checked to see if it's 0. Since our MRR is not 0, `total_num` must be non-zero. A simple value like `1` will work.
    *   So, a single data point would be `([0, 0, 0, 1], 1)`.
    *   If we pass this as a list `[([0, 0, 0, 1], 1)]`, the function will calculate the MRR for the single item (which is 0.25), put it in `separate_result` (`[0.25]`), and then calculate the mean (`np.mean([0.25])` which is `0.25`).
    *   The final return value will be `(0.25, [0.25])`, which matches the desired output.

5.  **Final Input:** The input argument `data` should be `[([0, 0, 0, 1], 1)]`. This is a list containing one tuple, where the tuple itself contains a list and an integer.
