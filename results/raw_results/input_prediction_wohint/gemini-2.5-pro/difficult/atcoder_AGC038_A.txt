*   **1. Analyze the Python code:**
    The code takes four integer inputs: `H`, `W`, `A`, and `B`.
    It initializes an `H`x`W` grid with all '0's.
    It then iterates through each cell `(i, j)` of the grid and applies a set of rules to change some '0's to '1's.
    The core logic is:
    *   If `i < B` and `j < A`, the cell is '0'.
    *   If `i < B` and `j >= A`, the cell is '1'.
    *   If `i >= B` and `j < A`, the cell is '1'.
    *   If `i >= B` and `j >= A`, the cell is '0'.
    This can be summarized as: the cell `(i, j)` is '1' if exactly one of the conditions `i < B` or `j < A` is true. Otherwise, it's '0'.
    Finally, it prints the grid row by row.

*   **2. Analyze the provided output:**
    The output is a very long string. The code's `print` statement suggests the output should be multi-lined. The provided JSON format has likely flattened the multi-line output into a single string.
    Let's count the characters in the output string. The total length is 10,000.
    A reasonable assumption for grid-based problems is that the dimensions are round numbers, so let's test `H=100` and `W=100`. This gives `H * W = 10000`, which matches the character count.

*   **3. Reconstruct the grid from the output:**
    If we assume a 100x100 grid, we can split the output string into 100 rows of 100 characters each.
    *   The first 5000 characters are all '1's. This means the first `5000 / 100 = 50` rows consist entirely of '1's.
    *   The remaining 5000 characters are all '0's. This means the last `50` rows consist entirely of '0's.

*   **4. Deduce the input values (H, W, A, B):**
    We have `H=100` and `W=100`. We need to find `A` and `B`.
    *   Let's look at a row that is all '1's (e.g., any row `i` where `0 <= i < 50`). For this row, `answer[i][j]` must be '1' for all `j` from 0 to 99.
        *   According to the logic, this means `(i < B) != (j < A)` must be true for all `j`.
        *   For `(j < A)` to have a constant boolean value for all `j` in `0..99`, `A` must be either `0` (making `j < A` always false) or `A > 99` (making `j < A` always true). Let's assume `A=0`.
        *   With `A=0`, the condition for an all-'1' row becomes `(i < B) != False`, which simplifies to `i < B`. This must hold for all `i` from 0 to 49. The most restrictive case is `i=49`, so we need `49 < B`, which means `B >= 50`.

    *   Now let's look at a row that is all '0's (e.g., any row `i` where `50 <= i < 100`). For this row, `answer[i][j]` must be '0' for all `j`.
        *   According to the logic, this means `(i < B) == (j < A)` must be true for all `j`.
        *   Using our finding that `A=0`, the condition becomes `(i < B) == False`, which simplifies to `i >= B`. This must hold for all `i` from 50 to 99. The most restrictive case is `i=50`, so we need `50 >= B`.

    *   Combining the two deductions: We have `B >= 50` and `B <= 50`. Therefore, `B` must be `50`.

*   **5. Final verification:**
    The predicted input values are `H=100`, `W=100`, `A=0`, `B=50`.
    *   For `i < 50`: `i < B` is true. For any `j`, `j < A` (i.e., `j < 0`) is false. `True != False` is true, so the row is all '1's.
    *   For `i >= 50`: `i < B` is false. For any `j`, `j < A` is false. `False == False` is true, so the row is all '0's.
    This matches the observed output perfectly. The input string read by the program would be these four numbers separated by spaces.
