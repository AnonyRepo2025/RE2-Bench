[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the input for the Python function `_sqlite_datetime_parse` that results in the given output.

**Function Signature:**
`_sqlite_datetime_parse(dt, tzname=None, conn_tzname=None)`

**Output:**
The string representation of the returned `datetime` object is `"2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00"`. This corresponds to a timezone-aware `datetime` object representing midnight on June 13, 2016, in the UTC timezone (`datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc)`).

**Analyzing the function `_sqlite_datetime_parse`:**

1.  **`if dt is None: return None`**: The output is not `None`, so the input `dt` cannot be `None`.

2.  **`dt = backend_utils.typecast_timestamp(dt)`**: The function first calls `typecast_timestamp` on the input `dt`. This suggests `dt` is a string.
    *   Looking at `typecast_timestamp`, it parses a string like `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ffffff"`.
    *   It creates a `datetime.datetime` object.
    *   Crucially, it sets `tzinfo=utc if settings.USE_TZ else None`. Since the output is timezone-aware (`+00:00`), we must assume `settings.USE_TZ` is `True`, and `typecast_timestamp` will return a UTC-aware `datetime` object.
    *   To get `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)` from this step, the input string `dt` should be `"2016-06-13 00:00:00"`.

3.  **`if conn_tzname:`**: This block is executed if `conn_tzname` is provided. It replaces the timezone of the `datetime` object. To keep the logic simple and directly achieve the output, it's best to assume this block is skipped. This happens if `conn_tzname` is `None`.

4.  **`if tzname is not None and tzname != conn_tzname:`**: This block is executed if `tzname` is provided (and is different from `conn_tzname`). It performs timezone conversions. Again, to keep the logic simple, we can assume this block is skipped by having `tzname` be `None`.

5.  **`return dt`**: The function returns the final `datetime` object.

**Synthesizing the Input:**

Based on the analysis, the simplest way to produce the desired output is as follows:

1.  Provide an input string `dt` that `typecast_timestamp` will parse directly into the target `datetime` object. The string `"2016-06-13 00:00:00"` will be parsed into `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)`.

2.  Avoid any further timezone modifications by leaving the optional arguments `tzname` and `conn_tzname` as their default value, `None`.

**Step-by-step execution with the predicted input:**

*   **Input:** `dt="2016-06-13 00:00:00"`, `tzname=None`, `conn_tzname=None`.
*   `_sqlite_datetime_parse` is called.
*   `dt` is not `None`.
*   `backend_utils.typecast_timestamp("2016-06-13 00:00:00")` is called. It returns `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)`. The variable `dt` is updated to this object.
*   The `if conn_tzname:` condition is false because `conn_tzname` is `None`.
*   The `if tzname is not None ...` condition is false because `tzname` is `None`.
*   The function returns the `datetime` object `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)`.
*   The string representation of this object is `"2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00"`, which matches the desired output.

This leads to the most straightforward and predictable input.
