The user wants me to find the input for the Python function `extract_code_from_html_text` that results in the given output.

**Function Analysis:**
The function `extract_code_from_html_text` takes an HTML string (`html_text`) as input.
1.  It first calls `format_line_html_text`. This helper function finds all `<pre>` and `<blockquote>` tags and replaces their content with a placeholder `self.CODE_MARK` (`-CODE-`). This is used to count the number of code blocks.
2.  The main function then re-parses the *original* `html_text` using `BeautifulSoup`.
3.  It finds all `<pre>` and `<blockquote>` tags in the original HTML.
4.  It iterates through these found tags.
5.  In each iteration, it calls `.get_text()` on the tag to extract its raw text content.
6.  It appends this extracted text to a list called `code_list`.
7.  Finally, it returns `code_list`.

**Reverse Engineering from the Output:**
The provided output is a list of two strings:
```json
[
    "print('Hello, world!')",
    "for i in range(4):\n                print(i)"
]
```
- This output is the `code_list` returned by the function.
- For the function to produce this list, it must have found two tags, either `<pre>` or `<blockquote>`, in the input `html_text`.
- The text content of the first tag must have been `print('Hello, world!')`.
- The text content of the second tag must have been `for i in range(4):\n                print(i)`.
- Any other HTML content (like `<p>` tags, text, etc.) surrounding these code blocks does not affect the final output of this specific function, as it only extracts content from `<pre>` and `<blockquote>`.

**Constructing the Input:**
Based on the analysis, I can construct an `html_text` string that contains these two code snippets, each wrapped in either a `<pre>` or a `<blockquote>` tag.

Let's create a simple HTML structure:
1.  A paragraph explaining the first code block.
2.  A `<pre>` tag containing the first code snippet: `print('Hello, world!')`.
3.  A paragraph explaining the second code block.
4.  A `<blockquote>` tag containing the second code snippet: `for i in range(4):\n                print(i)`.

The resulting `html_text` would be:
`"<p>Here is a simple Python program:</p><pre>print('Hello, world!')</pre><p>And here is a loop:</p><blockquote>for i in range(4):\n                print(i)</blockquote>"`

When this string is passed to `extract_code_from_html_text`:
- The function will find the `<pre>` tag and the `<blockquote>` tag.
- It will extract the text from the first tag: `"print('Hello, world!')"`.
- It will extract the text from the second tag: `"for i in range(4):\n                print(i)"`.
- It will return these two strings in a list, which matches the desired output.

The input JSON will contain this `html_text` as the value for the `args`. The `self` object is an instance of `HtmlUtil`, but its attributes are set during initialization, so we can represent it as an empty object in the input JSON.
