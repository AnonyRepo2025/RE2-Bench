1.  **Analyze the Target Output:** The desired output is `2.2204460492503136e-16`. This value is numerically identical to `np.finfo(np.float64).eps`, which is the smallest representable positive number for a 64-bit float such that `1.0 + eps != 1.0`. This is a very strong clue.

2.  **Examine the `log_loss` Function's Core Logic:**
    *   The function calculates the logistic loss, which is fundamentally based on `-log(p)`, where `p` is the predicted probability of the true class.
    *   To avoid `log(0)` errors, the function clips the predicted probabilities `y_pred` to be within the range `[eps, 1 - eps]`.
    *   The `eps` parameter defaults to `'auto'`, which sets `eps = np.finfo(y_pred.dtype).eps`. If `y_pred` consists of standard Python floats, `check_array` will convert it to a `numpy` array of `dtype=np.float64`. Thus, `eps` will be `np.finfo(np.float64).eps`.

3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** If we provide a "perfect" prediction, where the predicted probability for the true class is `1.0`, this value will be clipped to `1.0 - eps`. The loss for that sample would then be `-log(1.0 - eps)`. For a small `eps`, `log(1 - eps)` is approximately `-eps`. Therefore, `-log(1.0 - eps)` is approximately `eps`.

4.  **Verify the Hypothesis:** Let's calculate `-np.log(1 - np.finfo(np.float64).eps)`. In Python, this evaluates to `2.2204460492503136e-16`, which exactly matches the target output.

5.  **Construct the Input:** Now we need to create an input `(y_true, y_pred)` that leads to this calculation. We need the predictions to be "perfect" so they get clipped as described.
    *   Let's consider a simple binary classification scenario with two samples.
    *   `y_true = [0, 1]`: The true labels are class 0 and class 1.
    *   `y_pred = [0.0, 1.0]`: The predicted probabilities for the positive class (class 1). The first sample is predicted to be class 0 (prob 0.0), and the second is predicted to be class 1 (prob 1.0). This is a perfect prediction.

6.  **Trace the Execution with the Constructed Input:**
    *   `y_true = [0, 1]`, `y_pred = [0.0, 1.0]`.
    *   `eps` is set to `np.finfo(np.float64).eps`.
    *   `LabelBinarizer` fits on `y_true` and determines the classes are `[0, 1]`. It transforms `y_true` into the one-hot encoded format `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.
    *   `y_pred` `[0.0, 1.0]` is clipped to `[eps, 1.0 - eps]`.
    *   Since `y_pred` is 1D, the function assumes it represents the probability of the positive class and expands it to a 2D array of probabilities for both classes: `[[1 - eps, eps], [eps, 1.0 - eps]]`.
    *   The loss is calculated for each sample:
        *   Sample 1: True label is 0 (one-hot `[1, 0]`). Predicted probabilities are `[1 - eps, eps]`. The loss is `-log(1 - eps)`.
        *   Sample 2: True label is 1 (one-hot `[0, 1]`). Predicted probabilities are `[eps, 1 - eps]`. The loss is `-log(1 - eps)`.
    *   The `loss` array is `[-log(1 - eps), -log(1 - eps)]`.
    *   The function is called with `normalize=True` (default), so it returns the mean of the losses: `np.mean([-log(1 - eps), -log(1 - eps)])`, which is `-log(1 - eps)`.
    *   This final value is `2.2204460492503136e-16`, matching the target output.

7.  **Final Input Selection:** The input `y_true = [0, 1]` and `y_pred = [0.0, 1.0]` successfully produces the desired output without needing any other optional parameters. It's a simple and self-contained example.
