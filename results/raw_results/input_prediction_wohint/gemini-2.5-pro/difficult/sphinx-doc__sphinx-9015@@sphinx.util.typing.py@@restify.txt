1.  **Analyze the Target Output:** The desired output is the string `":obj:`tests.test_util_typing.T`"`.

2.  **Analyze the `restify` function:** I will trace the execution of the `restify` function to see which code path could produce the target output.
    *   `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:` returns `':obj:`None``. This doesn't match.
    *   `elif cls is Ellipsis:` returns `'...'`. This doesn't match.
    *   `elif cls in INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES:` returns a string starting with `':class:'`. The target output starts with `':obj:'`, so this path is incorrect.
    *   `elif inspect.isNewType(cls):` also returns a string starting with `':class:'`. This is incorrect.
    *   `elif types_Union and isinstance(cls, types_Union):` handles `Union` and `Optional` types, producing formats like `'Optional[...]'` or `'... | ...'`. This doesn't match.
    *   `elif cls.__module__ in ('__builtin__', 'builtins'):` returns a string starting with `':class:'`. This is incorrect.
    *   The function then calls either `_restify_py37(cls)` or `_restify_py36(cls)` depending on the Python version. The logic to produce the output must be within these (unprovided) helper functions.

3.  **Deduce the logic of the helper functions (`_restify_py37`/`_restify_py36`):**
    *   The output format is `":obj:`<some_string>``". I need to find a type `cls` that, when processed, results in this format.
    *   The provided source code includes `from typing import ForwardRef` and `from typing import _ForwardRef`. This is a strong hint. A `ForwardRef` is used to represent a type that has not yet been defined, using a string.
    *   By inspecting the source code of Sphinx (or by deduction), the `_restify_pyXX` functions contain a branch specifically for `ForwardRef` objects. This branch typically looks like this:
        ```python
        if isinstance(cls, ForwardRef): # or _ForwardRef on older python
            return ':obj:`%s`' % cls.__forward_arg__
        ```
    *   This logic perfectly matches the desired output format. It takes the `__forward_arg__` attribute of the `ForwardRef` object and wraps it in `":obj:`...`"`.

4.  **Construct the Input:**
    *   To make this branch execute and produce the target output, the input `cls` must be an instance of `typing.ForwardRef`.
    *   The `__forward_arg__` attribute of this `ForwardRef` instance must be the string `"tests.test_util_typing.T"`.
    *   Such an object can be created in Python with `cls = ForwardRef("tests.test_util_typing.T")`.

5.  **Format the Input as JSON:**
    *   The input to the `restify` function is the `cls` argument.
    *   I need to represent the `ForwardRef` object in JSON. Based on the required attribute, the JSON object for `cls` must have a key `__forward_arg__` with the value `"tests.test_util_typing.T"`.

6.  **Final Input Prediction:**
    *   The input will be a JSON object with a single key, `cls`.
    *   The value of `cls` will be another JSON object representing the `ForwardRef` instance, containing the necessary `__forward_arg__` attribute.

This leads to the following predicted input.
