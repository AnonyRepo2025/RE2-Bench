1.  **Analyze the function `replace_named_groups`:** The function takes a single string argument `pattern`. Its main purpose is to find named capturing groups in a regular expression string, which have the format `(?P<name>...)`.

2.  **Core Logic:**
    *   It uses `named_group_matcher = re.compile('\\(\\?P(<\\w+>)')` to find all occurrences of `(?P<...`.
    *   For each occurrence, it finds the complete group pattern by matching parentheses.
    *   It then replaces the entire group pattern (e.g., `(?P<id>\d+)`) with just the group name part (e.g., `<id>`).
    *   Finally, it returns the modified string.

3.  **Examine the Output:** The desired output is the string `"admin/password_change/done/"`.

4.  **Connect Logic to Output:** The function's modifications are triggered only if it finds a substring matching `(?P<...`. The output string `"admin/password_change/done/"` does not contain any such substrings.

5.  **Deduce the Input:** If the input `pattern` does not contain any named groups, the `named_group_matcher.finditer(pattern)` call will yield no matches.
    *   The list `named_group_indices` will be empty.
    *   The subsequent loops that perform the replacements will not execute.
    *   The function will return the original `pattern` string unmodified.

6.  **Conclusion:** To get the output `"admin/password_change/done/"`, the simplest input is the string itself. If `pattern` is `"admin/password_change/done/"`, the function will perform no replacements and return it as is, matching the desired output.

7.  **Final Input Formulation:** The function takes one argument, `pattern`. The input JSON should reflect this.
    ```json
    {
        "pattern": "admin/password_change/done/"
    }
    ```
