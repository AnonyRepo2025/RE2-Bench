[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The user wants to find the input (`self` and `other`) for the `Set._complement` method that produces the output `{"_elements": "frozenset({10, 15})"}`. This output corresponds to a `sympy.sets.sets.FiniteSet` instance containing the elements 10 and 15.

2.  **Examine the `_complement` Method:** I'll look at the source code of `_complement` to understand its logic. It's a method of the `Set` class and takes two arguments: `self` (an instance of a `Set` subclass) and `other` (another `Set`). The method's behavior depends on the type of `other`.

    ```python
    def _complement(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, ProductSet):
            ...
        elif isinstance(other, Interval):
            ...
        elif isinstance(other, Union):
            ...
        elif isinstance(other, Complement):
            ...
        elif isinstance(other, EmptySet):
            return S.EmptySet
        elif isinstance(other, FiniteSet):
            # This branch looks promising as it can return a FiniteSet.
            from sympy.utilities.iterables import sift

            def ternary_sift(el):
                contains = self.contains(el)
                return contains if contains in [True, False] else None
            sifted = sift(other, ternary_sift)
            return Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet)
    ```

3.  **Select the Most Likely Code Path:** The output is a `FiniteSet`. The branch `elif isinstance(other, FiniteSet):` is the most direct path to producing a `FiniteSet` as a result. The other branches seem to produce different types of sets (`Union` of `ProductSet`s or `Interval`s, `Complement` objects, etc.). I will focus on this `FiniteSet` branch.

4.  **Deconstruct the `FiniteSet` Branch Logic:**
    *   The code calculates `other - self` for `FiniteSet`s.
    *   It uses `sift` to partition the elements of `other` into three groups based on whether `self` contains them (`True`), does not contain them (`False`), or if containment is undecided (`None`).
    *   The final result is `Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), ...)`.
    *   To get the target output `FiniteSet({10, 15})`, the `Union` must simplify to this. This will happen if:
        1.  The first part, `FiniteSet(*sifted[False])`, is equal to `FiniteSet(10, 15)`. This means `sifted[False]` must be a set containing exactly `10` and `15`.
        2.  The second part, `Complement(...) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet`, evaluates to `S.EmptySet`. This happens if `sifted[None]` is empty.

5.  **Formulate Input Constraints:**
    *   `other` must be a `FiniteSet`.
    *   `sifted[False]` must be `{10, 15}`. This means `other` must contain the elements `10` and `15`, and for these elements, `self.contains(el)` must return `False`.
    *   `sifted[None]` must be empty. This means for every element `el` in `other`, `self.contains(el)` must return a concrete boolean (`True` or `False`), not a symbolic expression. This is easily achieved by using concrete numbers for the elements of both sets.
    *   The elements of `other` that are *not* `10` or `15` must end up in `sifted[True]`. This means for any other element `el` in `other`, `self.contains(el)` must return `True`.

6.  **Construct a Concrete Example:**
    *   Let's define `other`. It must contain `10` and `15`. Let's add some other elements that will be "removed" by the complement operation, say `5` and `20`. So, `other = FiniteSet(5, 10, 15, 20)`.
    *   Now let's define `self`.
        *   It must *not* contain `10` and `15`.
        *   It *must* contain `5` and `20`.
    *   A simple choice for `self` is `FiniteSet(5, 20)`.

7.  **Trace the Execution with the Constructed Input:**
    *   `self` = `FiniteSet(5, 20)`
    *   `other` = `FiniteSet(5, 10, 15, 20)`
    *   The code enters the `isinstance(other, FiniteSet)` branch.
    *   `sift` is called on the elements of `other`: `{5, 10, 15, 20}`.
        *   `el = 5`: `self.contains(5)` is `True`.
        *   `el = 10`: `self.contains(10)` is `False`.
        *   `el = 15`: `self.contains(15)` is `False`.
        *   `el = 20`: `self.contains(20)` is `True`.
    *   The `sifted` dictionary will be:
        *   `sifted[True] = {5, 20}`
        *   `sifted[False] = {10, 15}`
        *   `sifted[None] = {}` (empty)
    *   The return expression becomes `Union(FiniteSet(*{10, 15}), S.EmptySet)`.
    *   This simplifies to `FiniteSet(10, 15)`.

8.  **Finalize the Input:** The constructed inputs work. Now, I'll represent them in the required JSON format. A `FiniteSet` object is characterized by its `_elements` attribute, which is a `frozenset`.

    *   `self`: `FiniteSet(5, 20)` -> `{"_elements": "frozenset({5, 20})"}`
    *   `other`: `FiniteSet(5, 10, 15, 20)` -> `{"_elements": "frozenset({5, 10, 15, 20})"}`
