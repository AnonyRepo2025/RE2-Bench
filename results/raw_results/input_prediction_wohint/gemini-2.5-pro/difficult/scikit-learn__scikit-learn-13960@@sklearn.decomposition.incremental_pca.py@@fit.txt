The user wants me to determine the input `X` for the `fit` method of the `IncrementalPCA` class, given the final state of the object after the method has run.

### 1. Analyze the Output
The provided output gives the final values of the attributes of the `IncrementalPCA` object. Let's denote the final values with a subscript `_f`.
- `n_samples_seen_f`: 100. This means the input matrix `X` has 100 samples.
- `n_features`: The shape of `mean_f` and `components_f` tells us the number of features. `mean_f` has 3 elements, and `components_f` has shape (3, 3). So, `n_features = 3`.
- `batch_size_f`: 38. The data is processed in batches. With `n_samples=100` and `batch_size=38`, the `gen_batches` function will yield slices for batches of size 38, 38, and 24.
- `mean_f`: `[ 0.090962, -0.12025564, -0.02202145]`. This is the mean of the entire dataset `X`.
- `var_f`: `[0.98004322, 0.87276777, 1.009518]`. This is the variance of the entire dataset `X`.
- `components_f` (`V_f`): `[[ 0.67880581, -0.1558399, 0.71759083], [-0.15555747, 0.92452514, 0.34792979], [ 0.71765211, 0.34780338, -0.60333098]]`. These are the principal components (eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of `X`).
- `singular_values_f` (`S_f`): `[10.92506979, 9.35311337, 8.91038833]`. These are the singular values of the centered data matrix `X_centered`.
- `explained_variance_f`: `[1.20562778, 0.88364374, 0.8019699]`. This is related to the singular values by `explained_variance = singular_values**2 / (n_samples - 1)`. Let's check: `10.92506979**2 / 99 = 119.357 / 99 = 1.205627...`. It matches.

### 2. Reverse-Engineer the Input `X`
The core of the problem is that the `fit` method is incremental. The final state depends on the sequence of batches. A naive `X` constructed from the final properties (e.g., using `np.random.multivariate_normal`) would have the correct overall statistics but would likely not produce the exact same final state when processed incrementally, because the intermediate states would differ.

We need to find a deterministic `X` that is "stable" under the incremental updates, meaning the intermediate states converge to or are already at the final state.

Let's try to construct an `X` that has the desired global properties and also behaves well with the incremental algorithm.
A standard way to represent data with a given PCA is `X = Y @ V_f + M_f`, where:
- `M_f` is the mean vector.
- `V_f` are the principal components.
- `Y` is the "scores" matrix (`100 x 3`). `Y` must have a mean of zero, and its covariance matrix must be diagonal, with the diagonal elements being the explained variances. This is equivalent to `Y.T @ Y = diag(S_f**2)`.

We need to construct a simple, deterministic `Y` that satisfies these properties. Let's try a sparse `Y` with just enough non-zero entries to satisfy the conditions:
1.  `mean(Y, axis=0) == [0, 0, 0]`
2.  `Y.T @ Y == diag(S_f**2)` (which implies orthogonal columns)

We can construct `Y` with 6 non-zero rows:
- `Y[0, 0] = S_f[0] / sqrt(2)`, `Y[1, 0] = -S_f[0] / sqrt(2)`
- `Y[2, 1] = S_f[1] / sqrt(2)`, `Y[3, 1] = -S_f[1] / sqrt(2)`
- `Y[4, 2] = S_f[2] / sqrt(2)`, `Y[5, 2] = -S_f[2] / sqrt(2)`
- All other elements of `Y` are zero.

This `Y` has a zero mean. The sum of squares for each column `j` is `(S_f[j]/sqrt(2))**2 + (-S_f[j]/sqrt(2))**2 = S_f[j]**2`. The columns are orthogonal. So, this `Y` works.

Now, let's define our candidate `X`:
`X = Y @ V_f + M_f`
This `X` has rows 6 through 99 all equal to `M_f`.

### 3. Verify the Incremental Process with the Constructed `X`
Let's trace the `fit` method with this `X`. The batches are `X[0:38]`, `X[38:76]`, `X[76:100]`.

- **Batch 1 (`X[0:38]`):**
  - This batch contains the 6 non-trivial rows and 32 rows equal to `M_f`.
  - What is the mean of this batch? `mean(X[0:38])`.
    `sum(X[0:38]) = sum(Y[0:5] @ V_f + M_f) + 32 * M_f`
    `sum(X[0:38]) = sum(Y[0:5]) @ V_f + 6 * M_f + 32 * M_f`
    Since `Y[0]+Y[1] = 0`, `Y[2]+Y[3] = 0`, etc., `sum(Y[0:5])` is the zero vector.
    So, `sum(X[0:38]) = 0 @ V_f + 38 * M_f = 38 * M_f`.
    The mean of batch 1 is `M_f`.
  - In `partial_fit`, `col_mean` is `M_f`. `X_batch_centered = X[0:38] - M_f = Y[0:38] @ V_f`.
  - The SVD of `X_batch_centered` is performed. The right singular vectors of `A @ V` (where `V` is orthogonal) are `V`. So, the components computed from this batch (`V1`) will be `V_f`. The singular values (`S1`) will be the singular values of `Y[0:38]`, which are `S_f`.
  - After batch 1, `self.components_` is `V_f` and `self.singular_values_` is `S_f`. `self.mean_` is `M_f`.

- **Batch 2 (`X[38:76]`):**
  - All rows in this batch are `M_f`.
  - The batch mean `col_batch_mean` is `M_f`.
  - The previous mean `self.mean_` was `M_f`.
  - The `mean_correction` term is proportional to `(self.mean_ - col_batch_mean)`, which is zero.
  - The centered batch `X_batch_centered` is a matrix of zeros.
  - The matrix for SVD is `vstack(S_f.reshape*V_f, zeros, zeros)`.
  - The SVD of this matrix will again yield components `V_f` and singular values `S_f`. The state remains unchanged.

- **Batch 3 (`X[76:100]`):**
  - Same as batch 2. The state remains `V_f` and `S_f`.

- **Final State:**
  - The final `components_`, `singular_values_`, and `mean_` will match the target output values.
  - The other attributes like `explained_variance_` are derived from these and will also be correct.

This confirms that our constructed `X` is a valid input.

### 4. Calculate the `X` matrix
Now, we calculate the numerical values for `X`.
- `X[i] = M_f` for `i >= 6`.
- `X[0] = (S_f[0]/sqrt(2)) * V_f[0,:] + M_f`
- `X[1] = -(S_f[0]/sqrt(2)) * V_f[0,:] + M_f`
- `X[2] = (S_f[1]/sqrt(2)) * V_f[1,:] + M_f`
- `X[3] = -(S_f[1]/sqrt(2)) * V_f[1,:] + M_f`
- `X[4] = (S_f[2]/sqrt(2)) * V_f[2,:] + M_f`
- `X[5] = -(S_f[2]/sqrt(2)) * V_f[2,:] + M_f`

Let's compute these values.
`S_f = [10.92506979, 9.35311337, 8.91038833]`
`V_f` and `M_f` are as given.
`s_sqrt2 = S_f / sqrt(2) = [7.7252315, 6.6136084, 6.3006305]`

`v1 = s_sqrt2[0] * V_f[0,:] = [5.244110, -1.203910, 5.544110]`
`v2 = s_sqrt2[1] * V_f[1,:] = [-1.028699, 6.113608, 2.300630]`
`v3 = s_sqrt2[2] * V_f[2,:] = [4.521630, 2.191399, -3.800630]`

`X[0] = v1 + M_f = [5.335072, -1.324166, 5.522089]`
`X[1] = -v1 + M_f = [-5.153148, 1.083654, -5.566131]`
`X[2] = v2 + M_f = [-0.937737, 5.993352, 2.278609]`
`X[3] = -v2 + M_f = [1.119661, -6.233864, -2.322651]`
`X[4] = v3 + M_f = [4.612592, 2.071143, -3.822651]`
`X[5] = -v3 + M_f = [-4.430668, -2.311655, 3.778609]`
`X[6:] = M_f = [0.090962, -0.12025564, -0.02202145]`

This gives the final matrix `X`.
