[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The user wants to find the input arguments (`y_true`, `y_pred`, `labels`, `sample_weight`, `normalize`) for the `confusion_matrix` function that result in the output `[[20 20]\n [10 50]]`.

2.  **Deconstruct the Output:** The output string `"[[20 20]\n [10 50]]"` represents a 2x2 NumPy array:
    ```
    [[20, 20],
     [10, 50]]
    ```
    A confusion matrix `C` is defined such that `C[i, j]` is the number of observations known to be in group `i` and predicted to be in group `j`.

3.  **Analyze the `confusion_matrix` Function:**
    *   **`normalize` parameter:** The output consists of integers (20, 10, 50), not floating-point proportions. This strongly implies that `normalize` is `None`, as any other value ('true', 'pred', 'all') would result in a matrix of floats.
    *   **`labels` parameter:** The matrix is 2x2, which means there are two distinct classes. Let's call them `L1` and `L2`. If `labels` is not provided (`None`), the function determines the labels from the unique values in `y_true` and `y_pred` and sorts them. Let's assume the sorted labels are `L1` and `L2`. Then the matrix means:
        *   `C[0, 0] = 20`: 20 samples with true label `L1` were predicted as `L1`.
        *   `C[0, 1] = 20`: 20 samples with true label `L1` were predicted as `L2`.
        *   `C[1, 0] = 10`: 10 samples with true label `L2` were predicted as `L1`.
        *   `C[1, 1] = 50`: 10 samples with true label `L2` were predicted as `L2`.
    *   **Core Calculation:** The matrix is built using `coo_matrix((sample_weight, (y_true, y_pred)), ...)`. The values in the final matrix are the sums of `sample_weight` for each `(y_true, y_pred)` pair.

4.  **Synthesize the Inputs:**
    *   **Method 1: Using Counts (No `sample_weight`)**
        If `sample_weight` is `None`, it defaults to an array of ones. The values in the confusion matrix are then simple counts of occurrences.
        *   We need 20 pairs of `(y_true=L1, y_pred=L1)`.
        *   We need 20 pairs of `(y_true=L1, y_pred=L2)`.
        *   We need 10 pairs of `(y_true=L2, y_pred=L1)`.
        *   We need 50 pairs of `(y_true=L2, y_pred=L2)`.
        Let's use `L1=0` and `L2=1`. We can construct the `y_true` and `y_pred` arrays:
        `y_true = [0]*20 + [0]*20 + [1]*10 + [1]*50`
        `y_pred = [0]*20 + [1]*20 + [0]*10 + [1]*50`
        This would work, but the arrays are long (100 elements).

    *   **Method 2: Using `sample_weight`**
        A more concise way is to represent each of the four cases with a single data point and use `sample_weight` to specify the count.
        *   Case 1: `(y_true=0, y_pred=0)` needs a weight of 20.
        *   Case 2: `(y_true=0, y_pred=1)` needs a weight of 20.
        *   Case 3: `(y_true=1, y_pred=0)` needs a weight of 10.
        *   Case 4: `(y_true=1, y_pred=1)` needs a weight of 50.
        This leads to the following inputs:
        `y_true = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
        `y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 1]`
        `sample_weight = [20, 20, 10, 50]`

5.  **Final Verification:**
    *   `y_true = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
    *   `y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 1]`
    *   `labels = None` -> `unique_labels` will find `[0, 1]`. `label_to_ind` becomes `{0: 0, 1: 1}`.
    *   `sample_weight = [20, 20, 10, 50]`
    *   `normalize = None`
    *   The `coo_matrix` will be constructed with `data=[20, 20, 10, 50]`, `rows (from y_true)=[0, 0, 1, 1]`, and `cols (from y_pred)=[0, 1, 0, 1]`.
    *   This correctly aggregates the weights:
        *   `cm[0, 0]` gets weight 20.
        *   `cm[0, 1]` gets weight 20.
        *   `cm[1, 0]` gets weight 10.
        *   `cm[1, 1]` gets weight 50.
    *   The resulting array is `[[20, 20], [10, 50]]`, which matches the desired output. This approach is concise and correct.

6.  **Construct the Final JSON Input:** Based on the verification, the input parameters are assembled into the required JSON format.
    *   `y_true`: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
    *   `y_pred`: `[0, 1, 0, 1]`
    *   `labels`: `null`
    *   `sample_weight`: `[20, 20, 10, 50]`
    *   `normalize`: `null`
