[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the input for the Python function `world_to_pixel_values` which is a method of the `SlicedLowLevelWCS` class.

**1. Analyze the function's output:**
The output is `[-2.9416469260468148e-12, -7.123190925995004e-13]`. These are two floating-point numbers that are extremely close to zero. This strongly suggests that the expected, ideal output is `(0.0, 0.0)`, and the small non-zero values are due to floating-point inaccuracies, which are common in coordinate transformations. The output is a list of two elements, which implies the resulting sliced WCS has two pixel dimensions (`self.pixel_n_dim == 2`).

**2. Analyze the function's logic:**
The function `world_to_pixel_values` takes world coordinates (`*world_arrays`) and returns the corresponding pixel coordinates in the sliced WCS. Let's trace its execution backward from the return value.

- The function returns `pixel`.
- `pixel` is constructed from `pixel_arrays` using `_pixel_keep`: `pixel = tuple((pixel_arrays[ip] for ip in self._pixel_keep))`. Since the output has two dimensions, `self._pixel_keep` must contain two indices, e.g., `[0, 1]`.
- `pixel_arrays` is first calculated by `pixel_arrays = list(self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values(*world_arrays_new))`.
- Then, it's potentially modified by a loop that subtracts the `start` attribute of slices in `self._slices_pixel`.
  ```python
  for ipixel in range(self._wcs.pixel_n_dim):
      if isinstance(self._slices_pixel[ipixel], slice) and self._slices_pixel[ipixel].start is not None:
          pixel_arrays[ipixel] -= self._slices_pixel[ipixel].start
  ```
- For the final `pixel` to be `(0.0, 0.0)`, the values in `pixel_arrays` at the indices from `_pixel_keep` must be `0.0` after this subtraction step.

**3. Formulate a hypothesis (the simplest case):**
Let's assume the simplest possible scenario for the slicing configuration:
- No dimensions are actually sliced away. This means `self._pixel_keep = [0, 1]` and `self._world_keep = [0, 1]`, assuming a 2D WCS.
- The slices do not have an offset. This means `self._slices_pixel` is a tuple of `slice` objects where `start` is `None`. For a 2D WCS, this would be `(slice(None), slice(None))`.

Under this hypothesis:
- The subtraction loop does nothing because `self._slices_pixel[ipixel].start` is `None`.
- The `world_arrays_new` variable becomes identical to the input `world_arrays` because the `if iworld in self._world_keep:` condition is always true.
- Therefore, the core calculation simplifies to `pixel_arrays = list(self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values(*world_arrays))`.
- The final returned `pixel` will be `tuple(pixel_arrays)`.

So, to get an output of `(0.0, 0.0)`, the call `self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values(*world_arrays)` must return `(0.0, 0.0)`.

**4. Determine the input `world_arrays`:**
The function `self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values` is a standard WCS transformation. If we want it to return the pixel coordinate `(0, 0)`, we must provide it with the world coordinate that corresponds to pixel `(0, 0)`. This is a classic round-trip problem.

We can find this world coordinate by calling the inverse function: `self._wcs.pixel_to_world_values(0, 0)`.

**5. Construct the `self` object:**
To make this concrete, I need to define the `self._wcs` object. I'll construct a simple 2D `astropy.wcs.WCS` object. A standard FITS WCS is defined by keywords like `CRPIX`, `CRVAL`, and `CDELT`.
- `CRPIXj`: The 1-based reference pixel.
- `CRVALi`: The world coordinate at the reference pixel.
- `CDELTi`: The pixel scale.

Let's choose the simplest values:
- `self._wcs.wcs.crpix = [1.0, 1.0]`. This means the reference pixel is `(1, 1)` in the FITS 1-based standard. In `astropy`'s 0-based system, this is pixel `(0, 0)`.
- `self._wcs.wcs.crval = [150.0, -30.0]`. These are arbitrary world coordinates (e.g., RA and Dec).
- `self._wcs.wcs.cdelt = [-0.1, 0.1]`. An arbitrary scale.
- `self._wcs.wcs.ctype = ['RA---TAN', 'DEC--TAN']`. Standard celestial coordinate types.

With this WCS, a call to `self._wcs.pixel_to_world_values(0, 0)` will return the `crval` values, which are `(150.0, -30.0)`.

**6. Final Prediction:**
- The `self` object will be a `SlicedLowLevelWCS` instance configured for the simple case described above (no offsets, no dimensions dropped).
- The underlying `_wcs` will be the `astropy.wcs.WCS` object defined in step 5.
- The input `*world_arrays` must be the world coordinates corresponding to pixel `(0,0)`, which are `(150.0, -30.0)`.

This setup will cause `self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values(150.0, -30.0)` to be called, which will return `(0.0, 0.0)` (plus or minus floating-point error), which then becomes the final output of the function. This matches the observed output.
