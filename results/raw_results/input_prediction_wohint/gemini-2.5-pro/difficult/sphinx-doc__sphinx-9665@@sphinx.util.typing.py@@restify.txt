The user wants me to determine the input to the `restify` function that results in the output `":py:obj:None"`.

Let's analyze the code of the `restify` function:

1.  **`def restify(cls: Optional[Type]) -> str:`**: The function takes one argument, `cls`.
2.  **`try:`**: The main logic is within a try-except block.
3.  **`if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`**: This is the very first condition checked. If the input `cls` is the value `None` or if it is the type of `None` (`NoneType`), the function will execute the code inside this block.
4.  **`return ':py:obj:`None``**: If the condition in step 3 is met, the function immediately returns the string `':py:obj:None'`.

The desired output is `":py:obj:None"`. This exactly matches the return value from the first `if` statement in the function.

Therefore, to get this output, the input `cls` must satisfy the condition `cls is None or cls is NoneType`.

There are two simple ways to satisfy this:
a)  Pass `None` as the value for `cls`.
b)  Pass `type(None)` as the value for `cls`.

The simplest and most direct input is `cls = None`. In JSON format, the Python value `None` is represented as `null`.

So, the input to the function must be `cls` with the value `null`.

Let's trace the execution with this input:
- `restify` is called with `cls = None`.
- The condition `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:` is evaluated.
- `cls is None` evaluates to `True`.
- The `if` block is entered.
- The function returns `':py:obj:None'`.
- This matches the provided output.

The input JSON should therefore represent the argument `cls` being set to `null`.
