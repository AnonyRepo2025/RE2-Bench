[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Target Output:** The desired output is `[[1.1649954]]`. This is a 2D array with a single element, which implies the input arrays `X` and `Y` each contain one vector (one row). The function `euclidean_distances` calculates the distance between each vector in `X` and each vector in `Y`.

2.  **Understand the Function's Core Logic:** The function `euclidean_distances` calculates the Euclidean distance, which is `sqrt(sum((x_i - y_i)^2))`. The `squared` parameter controls whether the final square root is taken.
    *   If `squared=False` (the default), the output is the actual Euclidean distance.
    *   If `squared=True`, the output is the squared Euclidean distance.

3.  **Hypothesize `squared=False` (Default Case):**
    *   If `squared` is `False`, then the calculated distance is `1.1649954`.
    *   This means the squared distance, `sum((x_i - y_i)^2)`, must be `1.1649954 ** 2 ≈ 1.3572143`.
    *   We need to find input vectors `X` and `Y` that satisfy this.

4.  **Simplify the Problem:** Let's find the simplest possible vectors. One-dimensional vectors are the easiest to work with.
    *   Let `X` be `[[x1]]` and `Y` be `[[y1]]`. The input arrays must be 2D as enforced by `check_pairwise_arrays`.
    *   The squared distance is `(x1 - y1)^2`.
    *   We need `(x1 - y1)^2 = 1.3572143`.
    *   Taking the square root, we get `|x1 - y1| = sqrt(1.3572143) ≈ 1.1649954`.
    *   A very simple choice that satisfies this is `x1 = 0.0` and `y1 = 1.1649954`.

5.  **Construct the Input:**
    *   `X = [[0.0]]`
    *   `Y = [[1.1649954]]`
    *   `squared = False` (the default value)
    *   The other optional arguments, `X_norm_squared` and `Y_norm_squared`, can be left as `None` as the function will calculate them internally.

6.  **Trace the Execution with the Proposed Input:**
    *   **Function call:** `euclidean_distances(X=[[0.0]], Y=[[1.1649954]], squared=False)`
    *   `check_pairwise_arrays(X, Y)`: Converts the input lists to 2D NumPy arrays of `float64` type. `X` becomes `np.array([[0.0]])` and `Y` becomes `np.array([[1.1649954]])`.
    *   `X_norm_squared` is `None`, so `XX` is calculated: `XX = row_norms(X, squared=True)[:, np.newaxis]`. `row_norms` computes `0.0**2 = 0.0`. So, `XX` is `[[0.0]]`.
    *   `Y_norm_squared` is `None`, so `YY` is calculated: `YY = row_norms(Y, squared=True)[np.newaxis, :]`. `row_norms` computes `1.1649954**2 ≈ 1.3572143`. So, `YY` is `[[1.3572143]]`.
    *   The core calculation is `distances = -2 * safe_sparse_dot(X, Y.T) + XX + YY`.
        *   `safe_sparse_dot(X, Y.T)` computes the dot product: `0.0 * 1.1649954 = 0.0`.
        *   `distances = -2 * 0.0 + 0.0 + 1.3572143 = 1.3572143`.
    *   `np.maximum(distances, 0, out=distances)`: The distance is positive, so no change.
    *   `squared` is `False`, so the function returns `np.sqrt(distances)`.
    *   `np.sqrt(1.3572143)` is `1.1649954`.
    *   The final result is `[[1.1649954]]`, which matches the target output exactly.

7.  **Final Input Structure:** The input consists of the positional argument `X` and keyword arguments `Y` and `squared`. The other arguments can be omitted as they will take their default `None` values.
