[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the function `_osbornei(e, d)`:**
    The function takes a SymPy expression `e` and a symbol `d`. It traverses the expression `e` from the bottom up. For each `TrigonometricFunction` it finds, it applies a transformation. The transformation depends on the function type (sin, cos, tan, etc.) and its argument.

2.  **Analyze the transformation logic:**
    - An inner function `f(rv)` is defined to handle the transformation of a `TrigonometricFunction` `rv`.
    - It splits the argument of the function, `rv.args[0]`, into two parts: `const` (independent of `d`) and `x` (dependent on `d`). Note: this `x` is a local variable in the code, not necessarily the symbol `x` in the final output.
    - It computes a new argument `a = x.xreplace({d: S.One}) + const * I`. This means the `d`-dependent part has `d` replaced by `1`, and the `d`-independent part is multiplied by the imaginary unit `I`.
    - It then replaces the trigonometric function with a corresponding hyperbolic function, applying a specific rule:
        - `sin(arg)` -> `sinh(a) / I`
        - `cos(arg)` -> `cosh(a)`
        - `tan(arg)` -> `tanh(a) / I`
        - `cot(arg)` -> `coth(a) * I`
        - `sec(arg)` -> `sech(a)`
        - `csc(arg)` -> `csch(a) * I`

3.  **Analyze the desired output:**
    The output is `2*tanh(x)`.

4.  **Work backwards from the output:**
    - The `2` is a numerical coefficient. The transformation only applies to `TrigonometricFunction` instances, so the `2` must have been present in the original expression `e`. Thus, `e` must be of the form `2 * <something>`.
    - The core of the output is `tanh(x)`. Let's see which transformation rule can produce a `tanh`. The rule for `tan` is `tan(arg) -> tanh(a) / I`.
    - If we start with an expression containing `tan(arg)`, the transformation will yield `tanh(a) / I`. The output we want is `tanh(x)`, not `tanh(x) / I`.
    - To cancel the `1/I` factor, the original expression `e` must have contained a factor of `I`.
    - Let's hypothesize that the input expression `e` was `2 * I * tan(arg)`.
    - The `_osbornei` function would process `tan(arg)`, transform it to `tanh(a) / I`, and the whole expression would become `2 * I * (tanh(a) / I)`. The `I`s would cancel, leaving `2 * tanh(a)`.
    - This is very close. Now we just need to ensure that the transformed argument `a` is equal to the symbol `x`.

5.  **Determine the arguments `arg` and `d`:**
    - We need `a = x`.
    - The formula for `a` is `a = x_part.xreplace({d: S.One}) + const_part * I`, where `arg = const_part + x_part`.
    - Let's consider a simple case where the symbol `d` does not appear in `arg`. For example, let `d` be a symbol like `y`.
    - In this case, the entire `arg` is independent of `d`. So, `arg.as_independent(d)` will result in `const_part = arg` and `x_part = 0`.
    - The formula for `a` simplifies to `a = 0 + const_part * I = arg * I`.
    - We want `a = x`, so we must have `arg * I = x`.
    - Solving for `arg`, we get `arg = x / I`. Since `1/I = -I`, this means `arg = -I*x`.

6.  **Construct the final input:**
    - Based on the above, the original trigonometric function part was `tan(-I*x)`.
    - The full expression `e` was `2 * I * tan(-I*x)`.
    - The variable `d` can be any symbol that is not `x`, for instance, `y`.

7.  **Verification:**
    - Let `e = 2*I*tan(-I*x)` and `d = y`.
    - `_osbornei` is called. It finds the sub-expression `rv = tan(-I*x)`.
    - The argument is `arg = -I*x`.
    - `d` is `y`. Since `y` is not in `-I*x`, `arg` is independent of `d`.
    - `const, x_part = (-I*x).as_independent(y, as_Add=True)` gives `const = -I*x` and `x_part = 0`.
    - The new argument is `a = x_part.xreplace({y: 1}) + const * I = 0 + (-I*x) * I = -I**2 * x = -(-1)*x = x`.
    - The function `tan` is transformed to `tanh(a) / I`, which is `tanh(x) / I`.
    - The full expression becomes `2 * I * (tanh(x) / I)`.
    - SymPy simplifies this to `2 * tanh(x)`, which matches the desired output.
