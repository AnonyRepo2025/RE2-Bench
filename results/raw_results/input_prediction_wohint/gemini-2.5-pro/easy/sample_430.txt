The user wants me to find the input for the Python function `f` that results in the given output.

**Function Analysis:**
The function `f` takes two arguments, `arr1` and `arr2`.
1.  `new_arr = arr1.copy()`: It creates a new list `new_arr` which is a copy of the input list `arr1`.
2.  `new_arr.extend(arr2)`: It appends all elements from the input list `arr2` to the end of `new_arr`.
3.  `return new_arr`: It returns the modified `new_arr`.

Essentially, the function concatenates the two input lists `arr1` and `arr2` and returns the result.

**Output Analysis:**
The output is a single list: `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.

**Reverse Engineering:**
Since the output is the result of `arr1.extend(arr2)`, the output list is simply `arr1` followed by `arr2`. This means `arr1` must be a prefix of the output list, and `arr2` must be the remaining suffix.

There are many possible ways to split the output list into two parts, `arr1` and `arr2`. For example:
- `arr1 = []`, `arr2 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`
- `arr1 = [5]`, `arr2 = [1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`
- `arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7]`, `arr2 = [8, "", 0, -1, []]`
- `arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`, `arr2 = []`

Any of these pairs would be a valid input. I will choose a simple, non-trivial split. Let's split the output list into two non-empty parts. A reasonable choice is to split it somewhere in the middle.

Let's define:
- `arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7]`
- `arr2 = [8, "", 0, -1, []]`

**Verification:**
1.  `f` is called with `arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7]` and `arr2 = [8, "", 0, -1, []]`.
2.  `new_arr` is created as a copy of `arr1`: `new_arr = [5, 1, 3, 7]`.
3.  `new_arr` is extended with `arr2`: `new_arr` becomes `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.
4.  The function returns `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.

This matches the provided output. Therefore, this is a valid input.
