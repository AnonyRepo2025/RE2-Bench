The user wants me to find the input `nums` for the function `f` that results in the output `[]`.

Let's analyze the function `f(nums)` step by step, working backward from the output.

1.  **`return desc + asc + desc`**: The function returns the concatenation of three lists: `desc`, `asc`, and `desc`.
2.  **Output is `[]`**: For the concatenation `desc + asc + desc` to be an empty list `[]`, all three constituent lists must also be empty. Therefore, we can deduce that `asc` must be `[]` and `desc` must be `[]` at the time of the return statement.
3.  **`desc = asc[:len(asc) // 2]`**: This line calculates `desc`. If we know `asc` is `[]`, then `len(asc)` is 0. `len(asc) // 2` is `0 // 2`, which is 0. So, `desc` becomes `asc[:0]`, which is `[]`. This is consistent with our deduction that `desc` is `[]`.
4.  **`asc.reverse()`**: This line reverses the `asc` list in place. If `asc` is `[]` after this operation, it must have been `[]` before this operation as well.
5.  **`asc, desc = (nums.copy(), [])`**: This is the initialization step. `asc` is created as a copy of the input `nums`. Since we've determined that `asc` must be `[]` right after this step (and before the `reverse()` call), it means `nums.copy()` must have resulted in `[]`.
6.  **Conclusion**: The only way for `nums.copy()` to be `[]` is if the original list `nums` is also `[]`.

Let's verify this by running the function with `nums = []`:
- `asc, desc = ([].copy(), [])` -> `asc` is `[]`, `desc` is `[]`.
- `asc.reverse()` -> `asc` remains `[]`.
- `desc = asc[:len(asc) // 2]` -> `desc = [][:0]` -> `desc` remains `[]`.
- `return desc + asc + desc` -> `return [] + [] + []` -> `return []`.

This matches the desired output. Therefore, the input `nums` must be an empty list.
