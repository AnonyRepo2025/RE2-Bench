The user wants me to find the input for the Python function `f` that results in the output `9`.

**Function Analysis:**
The function is `f(nums, index)` and it returns `nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2`.
The key to solving this is understanding Python's order of evaluation and the behavior of `list.pop()`.

1.  **Evaluation Order:** In the expression `A + B`, Python first evaluates `A` completely, then evaluates `B` completely, and finally performs the addition.
    *   `A` is `nums[index] % 42`.
    *   `B` is `nums.pop(index) * 2`.

2.  **Step-by-step Execution:**
    *   Let's assume the value of `nums[index]` is `v` before the function call.
    *   First, the left side of the `+` is evaluated: `nums[index] % 42`.
        *   `nums[index]` is accessed, its value is `v`.
        *   The expression becomes `v % 42`.
    *   Next, the right side of the `+` is evaluated: `nums.pop(index) * 2`.
        *   `nums.pop(index)` is called. This method removes the element at `index` from the list `nums` and returns that element's value. Since the list has not been modified yet within this line of code, the value at `index` is still `v`. So, `nums.pop(index)` returns `v`.
        *   The expression becomes `v * 2`.
    *   Finally, the addition is performed. The function returns `(v % 42) + (v * 2)`.

3.  **Solving for `v`:**
    *   We are given that the output is `9`. So, we have the equation: `(v % 42) + (2 * v) = 9`.
    *   We need to find an integer value for `v` that satisfies this equation.
    *   Let's test a simple case. If `v` is a positive integer less than 42, then `v % 42` is just `v`.
    *   The equation becomes: `v + 2*v = 9`.
    *   This simplifies to `3*v = 9`.
    *   Solving for `v`, we get `v = 3`.
    *   This is a valid solution, as `0 <= 3 < 42`.

4.  **Constructing the Input:**
    *   We need to find `nums` and `index` such that `nums[index]` is `3`.
    *   The simplest possible input is a list with a single element, `3`, at index `0`.
    *   So, let's choose `nums = [3]` and `index = 0`.

5.  **Verification:**
    *   Let's trace `f(nums=[3], index=0)`.
    *   `v = nums[0] = 3`.
    *   The return value is `(3 % 42) + (3 * 2)`.
    *   `3 % 42` is `3`.
    *   `3 * 2` is `6`.
    *   The result is `3 + 6 = 9`.
    *   This matches the desired output.

Therefore, a valid input is `nums = [3]` and `index = 0`.
