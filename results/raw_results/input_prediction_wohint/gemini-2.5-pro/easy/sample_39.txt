The user wants me to determine the input to the function `f` that results in the output `0`.

**Function Analysis:**
The function `f(array, elem)` takes a list `array` and an element `elem` as input.
1.  It first checks if `elem` is present in `array` using the `in` operator.
2.  If `elem` is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `elem` in `array` by calling `array.index(elem)`.
3.  If `elem` is not found, it returns `-1`.

**Output Analysis:**
The given output is `0`.

**Reasoning:**
1.  Since the output is `0` and not `-1`, the condition `if elem in array:` must have evaluated to `True`.
2.  This means the function returned the result of `array.index(elem)`.
3.  Therefore, `array.index(elem)` must be equal to `0`.
4.  The `index()` method returns the index of the first element in the list that matches the given value.
5.  For the index to be `0`, the element `elem` must be located at the very beginning of the `array` (i.e., `array[0]`).
6.  I can choose any `array` and `elem` that satisfy this condition. A simple example would be to have `elem` as the integer `1` and `array` as a list where the first element is `1`. For instance, `array = [1, 2, 3]`.
7.  Let's trace with these inputs: `array = [1, 2, 3]` and `elem = 1`.
    *   `elem in array` (is `1` in `[1, 2, 3]`)? Yes, it is.
    *   The code proceeds to `return array.index(elem)`.
    *   `array.index(1)` returns `0`.
    *   The function returns `0`, which matches the desired output.
8.  A simpler valid input would be `array = [1]` and `elem = 1`.

I will use `array = [1, 2, 3]` and `elem = 1` for the final input.
