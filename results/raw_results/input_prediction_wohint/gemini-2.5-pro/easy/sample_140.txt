The user wants me to find an input `st` for the function `f` that results in the output `"Hey"`.

**1. Analyze the function `f(st)`:**
The function is defined as:
```python
def f(st):
    if st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i')) >= st.lower().rindex('i'):
        return 'Hey'
    else:
        return 'Hi'
```
The function returns `"Hey"` if the `if` condition is true, and `"Hi"` if it's false. The output is `"Hey"`, so the condition must evaluate to `True`.

**2. Deconstruct the `if` condition:**
The condition is `st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i')) >= st.lower().rindex('i')`.

Let's break it down step-by-step for an input string `st`:
1.  `lower_st = st.lower()`: The string is converted to lowercase.
2.  `last_i_index = lower_st.rindex('i')`: This finds the index of the *last* occurrence of the character 'i'. If 'i' is not in the string, this will raise a `ValueError`.
3.  `h_index = lower_st.rindex('h', last_i_index)`: This finds the index of the *last* occurrence of 'h', but the search is restricted to the part of the string starting from `last_i_index` to the end. If 'h' is not found in this slice, this will raise a `ValueError`.
4.  The final condition is `h_index >= last_i_index`.

**3. Reason about the condition's outcome:**
The method `str.rindex(substring, start_index)` searches for `substring` within the slice `string[start_index:]`. If the substring is found, it returns the index of its last occurrence *relative to the beginning of the whole string*. By definition, this returned index must be greater than or equal to `start_index`.

In our case, `h_index` is the result of `rindex('h', last_i_index)`. Therefore, if this call succeeds (i.e., doesn't raise a `ValueError`), the result `h_index` will *always* be greater than or equal to `last_i_index`.

This means the condition `h_index >= last_i_index` will always be `True` as long as the program doesn't crash. A crash would occur if either `rindex` call fails.

**4. Determine the requirements for a valid input:**
To get the output `"Hey"`, we need to provide an input `st` that allows the `if` condition to be evaluated without raising a `ValueError`. This requires:
*   The string `st` must contain the character 'i' (case-insensitive), so that `lower_st.rindex('i')` succeeds.
*   The string `st` must contain the character 'h' (case-insensitive) at or after the position of the last 'i', so that `lower_st.rindex('h', last_i_index)` succeeds.

**5. Construct a simple input:**
Let's find the simplest possible string that meets these two requirements.
The string `"ih"` works:
*   It contains 'i'. The last 'i' is at index 0.
*   It contains 'h' at index 1, which is after index 0.

**6. Verify the chosen input:**
Let's trace the execution with `st = "ih"`:
1.  `lower_st` becomes `"ih"`.
2.  `last_i_index = "ih".rindex('i')` evaluates to `0`.
3.  The condition becomes `"ih".rindex('h', 0) >= 0`.
4.  `"ih".rindex('h', 0)` searches for 'h' in `"ih"` starting from index 0. It finds 'h' at index `1`.
5.  The condition becomes `1 >= 0`, which is `True`.
6.  The function returns `"Hey"`.

The input `st = "ih"` correctly produces the desired output.
