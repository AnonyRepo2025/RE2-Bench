[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the input for the function `truncate_number` that results in the output `0.5`.

1.  **Analyze the function `truncate_number`:**
    The function takes one argument, `number`, which is a float.
    It returns the result of the expression `number % 1.0`.

2.  **Understand the operation `number % 1.0`:**
    The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division.
    When the divisor is `1.0`, the operation `number % 1.0` effectively isolates and returns the fractional part of the `number`.
    For example:
    *   `3.14 % 1.0` results in `0.14`
    *   `5.0 % 1.0` results in `0.0`
    *   `10.75 % 1.0` results in `0.75`

3.  **Relate the operation to the desired output:**
    The desired output is `0.5`.
    This means we are looking for an input `number` such that `number % 1.0` equals `0.5`.
    Based on the understanding from step 2, this means the input `number` must have a fractional part of `0.5`.

4.  **Construct a possible input:**
    The integer part of the number can be anything (e.g., 0, 1, 2, -1, -5, etc.), as it does not affect the result of the modulo `1.0` operation.
    Let's choose an arbitrary integer part, say `3`.
    Combining this with the required fractional part `0.5`, we get the number `3.5`.

5.  **Verify the constructed input:**
    If the input `number` is `3.5`, the function will execute `return 3.5 % 1.0`.
    The remainder of dividing `3.5` by `1.0` is `0.5`.
    The function returns `0.5`, which matches the provided output.
    Therefore, `3.5` is a valid input. Other valid inputs would be `0.5`, `1.5`, `123.5`, `-0.5`, etc. I will use `3.5` for the answer.
