[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to determine the input to a Python script based on its output.

**1. Analyze the Python code:**
- The script starts by reading an input and converting it to an integer `n`: `n = int(input())`.
- It then initializes two variables, `i` and `j`. `i` is set to `1`, and `j` is set to the square of `n`: `i, j = (1, n * n)`.
- A `while` loop runs as long as `i` is less than `j`.
- Inside the loop, the current values of `i` and `j` are printed, separated by a space.
- After printing, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i += 1`) and `j` is decremented by 1 (`j -= 1`).

**2. Analyze the output:**
- The output consists of multiple lines.
- The very first line is `1 100`.

**3. Connect the code and the output:**
- The first `print(i, j)` statement is executed when the loop starts for the first time.
- At the beginning of the first iteration, `i` is `1` and `j` is `n * n`.
- The first line of output is `1 100`.
- By comparing the initial values from the code (`1`, `n*n`) with the first line of output (`1`, `100`), we can deduce the value of `n*n`.
- `n * n` must be equal to `100`.
- Solving for `n`: `n = sqrt(100)`. Since `n` is an integer, `n` must be `10`.

**4. Verify the conclusion:**
- Let's assume the input `n` is `10`.
- `i` is initialized to `1`.
- `j` is initialized to `10 * 10 = 100`.
- The loop condition `while i < j` is checked.
- **1st iteration:** `i=1`, `j=100`. `1 < 100` is true. Print `1 100`. `i` becomes 2, `j` becomes 99.
- **2nd iteration:** `i=2`, `j=99`. `2 < 99` is true. Print `2 99`. `i` becomes 3, `j` becomes 98.
- ...
- This continues until `i` and `j` get closer.
- Let's look at the last line of the output: `50 51`.
- This means the last time the loop condition `i < j` was true was when `i=50` and `j=51`.
- In that iteration, `50 51` is printed. Then `i` becomes `51` and `j` becomes `50`.
- In the next check, the condition `i < j` becomes `51 < 50`, which is false. The loop terminates.
- This confirms that the entire output sequence is correctly generated when `n = 10`.

**5. Final Input:**
- The code expects an integer input. The value we determined is `10`. The `input()` function reads this as a string.
- Therefore, the input provided to the program must be "10".
