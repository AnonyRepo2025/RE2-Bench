[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the input for a given Python script that results in the output `0`.

**1. Analyze the Python script:**
- The script takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `N`, `A`, and `B`.
- It calculates `ans = N // (A + B) * A`. This is the first part of the result.
- It calculates `rem = N % (A + B)`.
- It adds `min(rem, A)` to `ans`. This is the second part of the result.
- Finally, it prints the total `ans`.

**2. Analyze the desired output:**
- The output is `0`.
- This means the final value of the variable `ans` must be `0`.

**3. Formulate the equation:**
The final value of `ans` is given by the expression:
`ans = (N // (A + B) * A) + min(N % (A + B), A)`

For `ans` to be `0`, and knowing that `N`, `A`, `B` are likely non-negative integers from typical problem contexts, both terms in the sum must be `0`.

**Term 1: `(N // (A + B) * A) == 0`**
This is a product. For it to be zero, either `A` must be `0` or `N // (A + B)` must be `0`.

**Term 2: `min(N % (A + B), A) == 0`**
For the minimum of two non-negative numbers to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. So, either `A` must be `0` or `N % (A + B)` must be `0`.

**4. Find a simple solution that satisfies the conditions:**
Let's explore the easiest way to make both terms zero.

- **Hypothesis 1: Let `A = 0`.**
  - If `A = 0`, Term 1 becomes `(N // (0 + B) * 0)`, which is `0` (assuming `B > 0` to avoid division by zero).
  - If `A = 0`, Term 2 becomes `min(N % (0 + B), 0)`, which is always `0`.
  - So, if `A = 0` (and `B > 0`), the final `ans` will always be `0`, regardless of the value of `N`.

- **Let's test this hypothesis with some example values:**
  - Let `N = 8`, `A = 0`, `B = 3`.
  - Input string would be `"8 0 3"`.
  - `N=8, A=0, B=3`.
  - `ans = 8 // (0 + 3) * 0 = 8 // 3 * 0 = 2 * 0 = 0`.
  - `rem = 8 % (0 + 3) = 8 % 3 = 2`.
  - `ans += min(rem, A) = 0 + min(2, 0) = 0`.
  - The final `ans` is `0`. This works.

- **Hypothesis 2: Let `N = 0`.**
  - If `N = 0`, Term 1 becomes `(0 // (A + B) * A)`, which is `0 * A = 0` (assuming `A+B > 0`).
  - If `N = 0`, Term 2 becomes `min(0 % (A + B), A) = min(0, A)`, which is `0` (assuming `A >= 0`).
  - So, if `N = 0` (and `A+B > 0`), the final `ans` will always be `0`.

- **Let's test this hypothesis with some example values:**
  - Let `N = 0`, `A = 5`, `B = 10`.
  - Input string would be `"0 5 10"`.
  - `N=0, A=5, B=10`.
  - `ans = 0 // (5 + 10) * 5 = 0 * 5 = 0`.
  - `rem = 0 % (5 + 10) = 0`.
  - `ans += min(rem, A) = 0 + min(0, 5) = 0`.
  - The final `ans` is `0`. This also works.

Both hypotheses lead to valid inputs. I will choose the first one as it's very simple. I'll pick small integer values for `N` and `B`.

**5. Construct the final input:**
- Let's use `N = 8`, `A = 0`, `B = 3`.
- The input string must be `"8 0 3"`.
- This input will be parsed into `N=8`, `A=0`, `B=3`.
- The code will execute as verified above and print `0`.
