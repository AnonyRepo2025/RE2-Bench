1.  The user wants me to determine the input `nums` for the function `f` that results in the output `[]`.

2.  Let's analyze the function `f(nums)` step by step:
    *   `def f(nums):` The function takes one argument, `nums`, which is expected to be a list.
    *   `nums.clear()`: This is the first operation. The `.clear()` method removes all elements from the list `nums` in-place. Regardless of what `nums` contained initially, after this line, `nums` is an empty list `[]`.
    *   `for num in nums:`: This loop attempts to iterate over the elements of `nums`. However, since the previous step just emptied `nums`, this is equivalent to `for num in []:`.
    *   A `for` loop over an empty list will not execute its body at all.
    *   `nums.append(num * 2)`: This line is inside the `for` loop. Since the loop never runs, this line is never executed.
    *   `return nums`: The function returns the final state of the `nums` list.

3.  Let's trace the execution.
    *   Suppose the input `nums` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
    *   `nums.clear()` is called. The list `nums` becomes `[]`.
    *   The `for num in nums:` loop is encountered. Since `nums` is `[]`, the loop body is skipped.
    *   The function returns `nums`, which is `[]`.

4.  Let's try another input. Suppose `nums` is `[]`.
    *   `nums.clear()` is called. The list `nums` remains `[]`.
    *   The `for num in nums:` loop is encountered. Since `nums` is `[]`, the loop body is skipped.
    *   The function returns `nums`, which is `[]`.

5.  Conclusion: Because of the `nums.clear()` call at the very beginning of the function, the list is always empty before the `for` loop starts. The loop, therefore, never executes, and the function always returns an empty list `[]`.

6.  This means that *any* list provided as input for `nums` will result in the output `[]`. I can choose any valid list as the input. A simple non-empty list like `[1, 2, 3]` is a good representative example.
