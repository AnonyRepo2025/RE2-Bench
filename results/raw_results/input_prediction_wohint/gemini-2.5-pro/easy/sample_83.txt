[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the input `text` for the function `f` that results in the output `"2:0"`.

Let's analyze the function `f(text)` step by step:

1.  `l = text.rpartition('0')`: This line splits the input string `text` at the last occurrence of the character '0'. It returns a tuple `l` of three elements: `(part_before_last_0, '0', part_after_last_0)`.
    *   `l[0]` is the substring before the last '0'.
    *   `l[1]` is the '0' itself.
    *   `l[2]` is the substring after the last '0'.

2.  `if l[2] == '':`: This condition checks if the substring after the last '0' is empty. This would be true if `text` ends with '0' or if '0' is not in `text` at all. If true, the function returns `'-1:-1'`.
    *   The given output is `"2:0"`, not `"-1:-1"`. Therefore, this `if` condition must be false.
    *   This means `l[2]` is not an empty string (`l[2] != ''`). This implies that the input `text` must contain at least one '0', and it must not end with '0'.

3.  `return f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find('0') + 1}'`: Since the `if` condition is false, this line is executed. The output is a formatted string.
    *   The output is given as `"2:0"`.
    *   By comparing `f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find('0') + 1}'` with `"2:0"`, we can deduce two things:
        a. `len(l[0])` must be equal to `2`. This means the substring before the last '0' must have a length of 2.
        b. `l[2].find('0') + 1` must be equal to `0`. This means `l[2].find('0')` must be `-1`. The `find` method returns -1 when the substring is not found. This is consistent with `l[2]` being the part *after* the *last* '0', so it cannot contain any '0's.

Let's summarize the requirements for the input `text`:
1.  It must contain at least one '0'.
2.  The last '0' in `text` must be preceded by a substring of length 2. This means the last '0' must be at index 2 (0-indexed).
3.  The string `text` must not end with '0'. This means there must be at least one character after the last '0'.

Let's construct a simple string that satisfies these conditions.
*   The string must look like `C1 C2 '0' S...`, where `C1` and `C2` are any two characters, and `S...` is a non-empty string.
*   Let's choose `C1 = 'a'`, `C2 = 'b'`. The string starts with `"ab"`.
*   The next character must be the last '0', so we have `"ab0"`.
*   There must be at least one character after this '0'. Let's choose `'c'`.
*   A simple valid input would be `text = "ab0c"`.

Let's verify this input:
*   `text = "ab0c"`
*   `l = "ab0c".rpartition('0')` results in `l = ('ab', '0', 'c')`.
*   `l[2]` is `'c'`, which is not `''`. The `if` condition is false.
*   The function returns `f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find('0') + 1}'`.
    *   `len(l[0])` is `len('ab')`, which is `2`.
    *   `l[2].find('0')` is `'c'.find('0')`, which is `-1`.
    *   `l[2].find('0') + 1` is `-1 + 1`, which is `0`.
*   The final returned string is `"2:0"`, which matches the desired output.

Another simple example could be `"1101"`.
*   `l = "1101".rpartition('0')` -> `('11', '0', '1')`
*   `len(l[0])` is 2.
*   `l[2].find('0') + 1` is 0.
*   Output is `"2:0"`.

I will use a simple, generic string like `"ab0c"` for the final answer.
