[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the inputs `text` and `chars` for the function `f` that result in the output `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.

Let's analyze the function `f(text, chars)`:
1.  The function takes two string arguments, `text` and `chars`.
2.  It checks if `chars` is a non-empty string (truthy).
3.  **If `chars` is not empty:** It executes `text = text.rstrip(chars)`. This removes any characters from the end of `text` that are also in `chars`.
4.  **If `chars` is empty:** It executes `text = text.rstrip(' ')`. This removes trailing whitespace from `text`.
5.  After stripping, it checks if `text` has become an empty string. If so, it returns `'-'`.
6.  Otherwise, it returns the modified `text`.

The given output is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`. This is not `'-'`, so we know that after the `rstrip` operation, `text` was not empty. The value of `text` after stripping must be exactly the output string.

We need to find an initial `text` and `chars` that satisfy this. Let's consider the two main execution paths:

**Scenario 1: The `if chars:` condition is true.**
This means `chars` is a non-empty string. The operation is `text = text.rstrip(chars)`.
The result of this operation is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
This implies that the original `text` was the output string followed by some characters that are all contained within the `chars` string.
Let's choose a simple example.
- Let the original `text` be `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.0"`.
- To strip the trailing `"0"`, the `chars` string must contain `"0"`.
- Let's set `chars = "0"`.
- Let's trace this:
    - `f(text="new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.0", chars="0")`
    - `if "0":` is true.
    - `text` becomes `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.0".rstrip("0")`, which is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
    - `text` is not `''`, so the function returns the new `text`.
- This works and produces the correct output.

**Scenario 2: The `if chars:` condition is false.**
This means `chars` is an empty string (`""`) or `None`. The operation is `text = text.rstrip(' ')`.
The result of this operation is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
This implies that the original `text` was the output string followed by one or more space characters.
- Let the original `text` be `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. "`.
- Let `chars` be `""`.
- Let's trace this:
    - `f(text="new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. ", chars="")`
    - `if "":` is false.
    - The `else` block is executed: `text = text.rstrip(' ')`.
    - `text` becomes `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. ".rstrip(' ')`, which is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
    - `text` is not `''`, so the function returns the new `text`.
- This also works and produces the correct output.

Both scenarios provide valid inputs. I will choose the first one as it demonstrates the more general functionality of stripping a specific set of characters.

Therefore, a valid input pair is `text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.0"` and `chars = "0"`.
