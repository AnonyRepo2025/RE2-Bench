[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the input for the `generate_email_pattern` function.

1.  **Analyze the function `generate_email_pattern`:**
    *   It is a method of the `RegexUtils` class.
    *   It takes one argument, `self`, which is an instance of the class.
    *   It takes no other arguments.
    *   Inside the function, it defines a hardcoded string variable `pattern`.
    *   It returns this `pattern` string.

2.  **Analyze the provided output:**
    *   The output is `{"output": "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"}`.
    *   The value of the "output" key is the exact string that is hardcoded inside the `generate_email_pattern` function.

3.  **Simulate the execution to predict the input:**
    *   The function's behavior is constant. It does not depend on any state of the `self` object or any other input parameters.
    *   It will always return the same regular expression string regardless of the input.
    *   Therefore, the only required input is an instance of the `RegexUtils` class for the `self` parameter.
    *   The `RegexUtils` class has a default `__init__` method that doesn't set any attributes. So, the `self` object can be considered empty for the purpose of this call.
    *   There are no other positional (`args`) or keyword (`kwargs`) arguments.

4.  **Construct the input JSON:**
    *   `self`: An empty object `{}` representing a basic instance of `RegexUtils`.
    *   `args`: An empty object `{}` because there are no positional arguments.
    *   `kwargs`: An empty object `{}` because there are no keyword arguments.

This leads to the final input structure.
