The output "a=1&b=2&c=3" is a URL-encoded string with three key-value pairs. To produce this output, the `urlencode` function must be called with a `query` parameter that contains these pairs in order (a=1, b=2, c=3) and a `doseq` parameter that doesn't affect the result since all values are single strings.

1. **Query Structure**: The output order is fixed (a, b, c), so `query` must preserve order. A list of tuples `[('a', '1'), ('b', '2'), ('c', '3')]` ensures this.
2. **Value Handling**: All values are strings ('1', '2', '3'). The condition `not doseq or isinstance(value, (str, bytes))` is true even if `doseq=True` (since values are strings), so `doseq` can be `false` or `true`. We choose `false` for simplicity.
3. **MultiValueDict Consideration**: While a `MultiValueDict` with single-value lists (e.g., `{'a': ['1'], 'b': ['2'], 'c': ['3']}`) and `doseq=true` would work, it requires extra steps (conversion to lists of tuples) and doesn't guarantee order. The list of tuples is more straightforward.
4. **Dictionary Limitation**: A regular dict (e.g., `{'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3'}`) may not preserve order in older Python versions, so it's avoided.

Thus, the input is:
- `query`: `[('a', '1'), ('b', '2'), ('c', '3')]` (represented as a list of lists in JSON).
- `doseq`: `false` (works and is simplest).
