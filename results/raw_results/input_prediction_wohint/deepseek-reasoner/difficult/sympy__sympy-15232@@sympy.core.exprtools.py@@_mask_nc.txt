To determine the input for the `_mask_nc` function given the output `["x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n", null, null]`, we need to simulate the function's behavior step by step. The output indicates:
1. The first element is the string representation of the expression after processing.
2. The second element is `null`, meaning the substitution dictionary is empty or not needed.
3. The third element is `null`, indicating no non-commutative symbols were found or processed.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Function Logic Overview**:
   - `_mask_nc` processes an expression `eq` to mask non-commutative parts.
   - If `eq` is commutative, it returns `(eq, {}, [])`.
   - If `eq` is non-commutative, it traverses the expression to identify non-commutative symbols or objects, performs substitutions, and returns `(modified_expr, substitution_dict, nc_syms)`.

2. **Analysis of Output**:
   - The output expression `"x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n"` is commutative (as it involves standard multiplication and addition of symbols).
   - The second and third elements are `null`, which corresponds to:
     - `{}` (empty dictionary) for substitutions, converted to `None` due to `{} or None` in the return statement.
     - `[]` (empty list) for `nc_syms`, represented as `null` in the output JSON.

3. **Input Requirements**:
   - For the commutative branch to be taken, the input expression must be commutative.
   - The output expression matches the input expression exactly since no substitutions were applied.
   - The input must therefore be the commutative expression represented by the string `"x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n"`.

4. **Input Structure**:
   - The function accepts `eq` (the expression) and an optional `name` (default `None`).
   - Since `name` does not affect the output for commutative expressions, it can be omitted.
   - The input JSON should provide `eq` as a string representing the expression.

### Conclusion:
The input is the expression `"x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n"` passed as `eq`, with no `name` parameter. The function processes it as commutative, returning the observed output.
