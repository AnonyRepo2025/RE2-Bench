The output value 2.2204460492503136e-16 is the machine epsilon for float64 (approximately 2.22e-16), which occurs when the log loss is calculated for a perfect prediction with clipped probabilities. Specifically:
- This value equals -log(1 - ε), where ε is the machine epsilon, when the true class probability is clipped to (1 - ε).
- For binary classification with one sample:
  - If y_true = [1] (true label is class 1)
  - y_pred = [[0.0, 1.0]] (predicted probabilities)
- After clipping, y_pred becomes [[ε, 1 - ε]], leading to loss = -log(1 - ε) ≈ ε.
- The LabelBinarizer requires at least two classes. Since y_true has only one unique label, the `labels` parameter must be explicitly set to [0, 1] to avoid a ValueError.
- The output is normalized by sample count (default), so for one sample, the loss is -log(1 - ε) = ε = 2.2204460492503136e-16.

Thus, the input is:
- y_true: [1] (one sample, class 1)
- y_pred: [[0.0, 1.0]] (binary probabilities for the sample)
- labels: [0, 1] (explicitly provided classes)
- Other parameters (eps, normalize, sample_weight) use defaults.
