The output is ":py:obj:`None`", which comes from the first condition in `restify`:  
`if cls is None or cls is NoneType: return ':py:obj:`None``'`.  

This means the input `cls` must be either:  
1. `None` (null), or  
2. `NoneType` (the type of None, equivalent to `type(None)`).  

Since JSON cannot represent Python types directly, and `None` is simpler to represent, I'll choose `cls = None`.  

The function `restify` is standalone (no `self`), so:  
- `self` should be `null`  
- `args` should contain the keyword argument `cls` set to `null`  
- `kwargs` remains empty  

This matches the output because:  
- The condition `cls is None` is satisfied  
- The function returns ":py:obj:`None`" immediately
