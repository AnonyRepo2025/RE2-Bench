The output is "sqrt(17)/2", which represents the Euclidean distance between two points. The distance formula is \(\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\). Setting this equal to \(\sqrt{17}/2\) gives:
\[
\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{17}}{2}
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = \frac{17}{4}
\]
A simple solution is \((x_2 - x_1) = \frac{1}{2}\) and \((y_2 - y_1) = 2\), as \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 2^2 = \frac{1}{4} + 4 = \frac{17}{4}\). Choosing the origin for the first point, set:
- `self` as `Point(0, 0)`
- `p` as `Point(1/2, 2)`

The coordinates must be exact to avoid floating-point inaccuracies. Represent \(\frac{1}{2}\) as the string `"1/2"` to be sympified to a rational number. The input JSON uses:
- `self`: Point with `args` `[0, 0]`
- `p`: Point with `args` `["1/2", 2]` (passed as the first argument in `args`)
- `kwargs`: empty
