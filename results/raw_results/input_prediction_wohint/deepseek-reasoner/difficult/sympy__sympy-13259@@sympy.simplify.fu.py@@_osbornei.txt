[THOUGHT]
The output is "2*tanh(x)", which is the result of applying the `_osbornei` function. This function transforms trigonometric functions into hyperbolic functions by replacing the argument `arg` with `a = x.replace(d, 1) + const*I`, where `const` is the part independent of `d`. For tangent:
- Original: `tan(arg)`
- Transformed: `tanh(a)/I`

Given the output "2*tanh(x)", we need to find an input expression `e` such that after transformation, we get this result. The output contains `tanh(x)`, which corresponds to `tanh(a)` where `a = x`. This means:
1. In the transformation, `a` must be `x`, so `x.replace(d, 1) = x` and `const = 0`. Thus, the original argument of `tan` must be `d*x` (or equivalent).
2. The transformation introduces a factor of `1/I` for `tan`. To cancel this and get `tanh(x)`, the original expression must include a factor of `I`. 
3. The coefficient `2` must come from the original expression.

Therefore, the original expression should be `2*I*tan(d*x)`. After transformation:
- `tan(d*x)` â†’ `tanh(x)/I`
- `2*I * (tanh(x)/I) = 2*tanh(x)`

The symbol `d` must be provided as the second argument to match the variable in the expression. Thus, the input is:
- `e = "2*I*tan(d*x)"`
- `d = "d"` (as a symbol)
