[THOUGHT]
The `solve` method returns a path of moves from the initial state to the goal state. An empty output `[]` indicates that no moves were needed, meaning the initial state was already the goal state. The goal state is defined in the `__init__` method as `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]`. Therefore, the `initial_state` must be this goal state. The `solve` method takes no arguments besides `self`, so the input only requires the `initial_state` attribute of `self`.
