The output is: `tests.test_util_typing."<MyClass2>"`. To achieve this:

1. The function `stringify` first checks if the input `annotation` is a string. If it is:
   - If the string starts and ends with single quotes (`'`), it returns the substring without these quotes.
   - Otherwise, it returns the string as-is.

2. The output contains double quotes around `<MyClass2>` and no outer single quotes. This suggests:
   - The input string must be exactly `tests.test_util_typing."<MyClass2>"` (without outer single quotes) so that it passes the first condition and is returned unchanged.
   - If the input had outer single quotes (e.g., `'tests.test_util_typing."<MyClass2>"'`), the function would strip them, but the output would still be the same. However, the simplest input that produces the output is the raw string without outer quotes.

3. Other conditions (like `TypeVar`, `NewType`, or built-in classes) don't match because:
   - The output structure doesn't match their handling (e.g., no `__qualname__` or `__module__` patterns for built-ins).
   - The output contains double quotes and angle brackets, which are atypical for class representations.

Thus, the input `annotation` must be the string: `tests.test_util_typing."<MyClass2>"`.
