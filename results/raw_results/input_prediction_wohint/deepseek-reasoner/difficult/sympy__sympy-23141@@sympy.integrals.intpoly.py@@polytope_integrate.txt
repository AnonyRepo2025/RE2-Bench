The output is a rational number: 1633405224899363/24000000000000. This represents the result of integrating a polynomial over a polytope. Since the output is a single rational number (not a dictionary), this indicates that:

1. `max_degree` must be `None` (otherwise, the function would return a dictionary of integrals for polynomials up to that degree).
2. `expr` must be a single polynomial expression (not a list), as a list would require `max_degree` to be set.
3. The polytope is likely 2D (since 3D H-representation isn't implemented, and the output matches 2D integration behavior).

The fraction simplifies to approximately 68.05855103747346. To achieve this result with a simple polytope:
- Use a unit right triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1), which has an area of 1/2.
- Set the polynomial to the constant `1633405224899363/12000000000000` (twice the output value).
- The integral of a constant `c` over a region with area `A` is `c * A`.
- Here, `(1633405224899363/12000000000000) * (1/2) = 1633405224899363/24000000000000`.

The input JSON should represent:
- `poly`: The polygon as a `Polygon` object with the specified vertices.
- `expr`: The constant polynomial as a string (to be sympified).
- `clockwise`: `false` (default, vertices are counter-clockwise).
- `max_degree`: Omitted (defaults to `None`).

This input will produce the exact output fraction when integrated.
