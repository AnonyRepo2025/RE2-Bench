The goal is to determine the input arguments for `_sqlite_datetime_parse` that produce the output "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00". The function processes a datetime string (`dt`), applies timezone adjustments based on `conn_tzname` and `tzname`, and returns a timezone-aware datetime object. The output represents a UTC datetime.

Key observations:
1. The output is a UTC datetime string ("2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00"), indicating the result is timezone-aware.
2. `typecast_timestamp` converts the input string `dt` to a datetime object. For the output to be UTC, `dt` must represent "2016-06-13 00:00:00" in UTC.
3. If `conn_tzname` is provided, the datetime's timezone is set to `conn_tzname`. If `tzname` is provided and differs from `conn_tzname`, further adjustments occur.
4. To get the exact UTC output without adjustments:
   - `dt` should be a string that `typecast_timestamp` converts to "2016-06-13 00:00:00 UTC" (e.g., "2016-06-13 00:00:00").
   - Both `tzname` and `conn_tzname` should be `None` to skip timezone changes.

Thus, the simplest input is:
- `dt`: "2016-06-13 00:00:00" (parsed to UTC datetime by `typecast_timestamp`)
- `tzname`: `None`
- `conn_tzname`: `None`

This input avoids timezone adjustments, preserving the UTC datetime directly from `typecast_timestamp`.
