[THOUGHT]
The output "ONE MILLION ONLY" corresponds to the number 1,000,000 without any fractional part. The `NumberWordFormatter.format_string` method processes the input string by splitting it into integer and fractional parts. For the output to be "ONE MILLION ONLY", the integer part must be "1000000" and the fractional part must be empty (to avoid generating "AND CENTS" in the output). 

- The integer part "1000000" is processed in chunks of three digits from right to left:
  - Reversed: "0000001" → padded to length multiple of 3: "000000100" (added "00").
  - Chunks: "000" (hundreds), "000" (thousands), "001" (millions).
  - "000" chunks yield empty strings.
  - "001" → `trans_three("001")` → `trans_two("01")` → "ONE" (since "01" → first digit '0' → return `NUMBER[1]`).
  - Magnitude for index 2 (millions): "MILLION".
  - Combined: "ONE MILLION".

- Fractional part: Must be empty (rstr = '') to skip "AND CENTS" section.
- Thus, input must be "1000000" (no decimal point) or "1000000." (decimal point with no fractional digits). We choose the simpler form without decimal point.

The `__init__` method of `NumberWordFormatter` has no parameters, so `self` is an empty dictionary. The method is called with one positional argument `x = "1000000"`.
