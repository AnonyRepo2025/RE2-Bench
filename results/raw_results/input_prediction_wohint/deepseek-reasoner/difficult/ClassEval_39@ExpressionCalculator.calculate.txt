The output is 3.0, which is the result of evaluating an arithmetic expression. The `calculate` method processes the input expression through several steps:

1. **Transformation**: 
   - Removes whitespace and trailing '='.
   - Replaces '-' with '~' for negative numbers in specific contexts (e.g., at the start or after operators). For "1+2", no changes occur as there are no '-' signs.

2. **Conversion to Postfix**:
   - The expression "1+2" is tokenized into ["1", "+", "2"].
   - Using the shunting-yard algorithm in `prepare`, it converts to postfix notation: ["1", "2", "+"].
   - The postfix stack is reversed to ["+", "2", "1"] for evaluation.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Pop "1" → not an operator → push to result stack: ["1"].
   - Pop "2" → not an operator → push to result stack: ["1", "2"].
   - Pop "+" → operator → pop two values (2, 1) → compute 1 + 2 = 3 → push "3" to result stack.
   - Final result stack: ["3"].
   - `eval('*'.join(["3]))` evaluates to 3.0.

Thus, the expression "1+2" produces the output 3.0. The `self` parameter is empty since `__init__` sets no relevant state, and `kwargs` is unused.
