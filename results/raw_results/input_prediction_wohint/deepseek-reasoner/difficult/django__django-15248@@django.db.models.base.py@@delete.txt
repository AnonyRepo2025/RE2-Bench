The output shows the result of calling the `delete` method: 1 object was deleted, specifically one instance of the "signals.Person" model. To achieve this output:

1. The `delete` method requires a model instance with a non-None primary key. Since only one object was deleted, the instance must be a "signals.Person" object with a valid PK.

2. The `using` parameter defaults to `None`, which triggers database routing. The instance's `_state.db` attribute ("default" here) determines the database.

3. The `keep_parents=False` (default) is acceptable because:
   - The output shows no parent models were deleted
   - This implies the model has no parent relations or parents were kept via `keep_parents=True` (but False works as no parents appear)

4. The instance representation needs:
   - `__class__`: Must be "signals.Person" to match the output
   - `pk`: Non-None value (1 chosen arbitrarily)
   - `_state`: Critical for database routing:
     - `db="default"`: Matches DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS
     - `adding=False`: Indicates existing DB record

5. Parameters:
   - `using=None`: Uses default routing
   - `keep_parents=False`: Default behavior
   - No additional args/kwargs needed

The input must create this scenario where deleting the instance only affects itself (no cascading deletes), hence the simple output.
