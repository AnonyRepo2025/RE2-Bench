To predict the input for `diop_solve` given the output `["3*t_0 - 5", "2*t_0 - 5"]`, we need to reverse-engineer the linear Diophantine equation that produces this solution. The solution represents the values of two variables (say `x` and `y`) parameterized by `t_0`:

- `x = 3*t_0 - 5`
- `y = 2*t_0 - 5`

A linear Diophantine equation in two variables has the form:  
`a*x + b*y = c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers.

Substituting the solution expressions:  
`a*(3*t_0 - 5) + b*(2*t_0 - 5) = c`

Expanding:  
`(3a + 2b)*t_0 - 5a - 5b = c`

For this to hold for all integer values of `t_0`, the coefficient of `t_0` must be zero (since the equation must be independent of `t_0`), and the constant term must equal `c`:

1. **Coefficient of `t_0`**:  
   `3a + 2b = 0`  
   This implies `3a = -2b`, so `a = -2k` and `b = 3k` for some integer `k`.

2. **Constant term**:  
   `-5a - 5b = c`  
   Substituting `a = -2k` and `b = 3k`:  
   `-5(-2k) - 5(3k) = 10k - 15k = -5k = c`

The equation becomes:  
`-2k*x + 3k*y = -5k`

Dividing by `k` (assuming `k â‰  0`):  
`-2x + 3y = -5`  
or equivalently:  
`2x - 3y = 5`

Thus, the equation is `2x - 3y - 5 = 0`.

The output uses `t_0` as the parameter, so the input must specify `param=t_0` (the default is `t`). The input equation is represented as a string `"2*x - 3*y - 5"`.

The input structure follows the example: `self` is `null` (since `diop_solve` is a function, not a method), `args` contains the equation string, and `kwargs` specifies the parameter symbol.
