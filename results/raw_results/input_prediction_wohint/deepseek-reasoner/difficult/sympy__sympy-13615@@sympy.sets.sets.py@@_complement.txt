The output shows `_elements` as `frozenset({10, 15})`, which represents a FiniteSet containing elements 10 and 15. This output is the result of calling `Set._complement(self, other)`, where the result is a FiniteSet. 

From the `_complement` method, when `other` is a FiniteSet, the method sifts its elements based on containment in `self`:
- Elements where `self.contains(el)` returns `False` are included in the result.
- Elements where `self.contains(el)` returns `None` would be wrapped in a Complement set, but the output shows no such elements.
- Elements where `self.contains(el)` returns `True` are excluded.

The output `frozenset({10, 15})` indicates:
1. `other` must contain at least 10 and 15.
2. For both 10 and 15, `self.contains(10)` and `self.contains(15)` returned `False` (they are not in `self`).
3. There are no elements where containment was `None` (otherwise, the result would include a Complement set).
4. The result is exactly `FiniteSet(10, 15)`, meaning `other - self = {10, 15}`.

The simplest input satisfying this is:
- `self = EmptySet` (contains nothing, so `self.contains(any)` returns `False`).
- `other = FiniteSet(10, 15)` (the set to subtract from).

With this input:
- `other` is a FiniteSet, so the FiniteSet branch is taken.
- `sift(other, ternary_sift)` returns `{False: [10, 15]}` (no `True` or `None` elements).
- The result is `Union(FiniteSet(10, 15), S.EmptySet) = FiniteSet(10, 15)`.
- The `_elements` attribute of this result is `frozenset({10, 15})`, matching the output.

Thus, the input is:
- `self`: An instance of `EmptySet`.
- `other`: An instance of `FiniteSet` with elements 10 and 15.
