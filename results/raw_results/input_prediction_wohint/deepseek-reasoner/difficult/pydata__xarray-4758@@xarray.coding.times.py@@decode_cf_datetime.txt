The output shows an array of datetime strings:  
['1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000', '1681-05-27T13:00:00.500000000',  
'1681-05-27T14:00:00.500000000', '1681-05-27T15:00:00.500000000',  
'1681-05-27T16:00:00.500000000']  

1. **Infer time unit and reference date**:  
   - The timestamps are spaced exactly 1 hour apart, each with a constant fractional second (0.5 seconds).  
   - This suggests the input `units` likely uses **hours** as the time unit and a reference date with **0.5 seconds**.  
   - The earliest timestamp is `1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000`, so the reference date should be `1681-05-27 12:00:00.5`.  

2. **Determine `num_dates`**:  
   - The output has 5 consecutive timestamps starting at `12:00:00.5` and ending at `16:00:00.5`.  
   - With `units = "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.5"`, the numeric values would be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (0 hours to 4 hours from the reference).  

3. **Calendar and `use_cftime`**:  
   - The year 1681 is within pandas' supported range (1677â€“2262), so `calendar` must be `"standard"` (or `None`, defaulting to standard).  
   - The fractional seconds are preserved, confirming `use_cftime=None` (default), allowing pandas-based decoding.  

4. **Validation**:  
   - `_decode_datetime_with_pandas` would:  
     - Parse `units` into `delta="hours"` and `ref_date="1681-05-27 12:00:00.5"`.  
     - Convert `num_dates=[0,1,2,3,4]` to nanoseconds: `[0, 3.6e+12, 7.2e+12, ...]`.  
     - Add to `ref_date` to produce the exact output timestamps.  

**Conclusion**:  
Input must be:  
- `num_dates = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`  
- `units = "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.5"`  
- `calendar = null` (defaults to "standard")  
- `use_cftime = null` (defaults to pandas decoding)
