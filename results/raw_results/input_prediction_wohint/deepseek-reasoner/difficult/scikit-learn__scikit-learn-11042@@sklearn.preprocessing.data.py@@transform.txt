The output shows a sparse matrix representation with:
- Shape: (1, 7) â†’ 1 sample, 7 features after encoding
- Non-zero element at column index 4 (indices=[4])
- Only one non-zero value (data=[1.0], indptr=[0,1])

To achieve this:
1. The encoder must have been fitted with one categorical feature (n_features=1) and `n_values='auto'`, leading to:
   - `n_values_ = [7]` (feature has 7 categories: 0-6)
   - `feature_indices_ = [0, 7]` (cumulative offsets)
   - `active_features_ = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (all categories present during fit)
2. Input `X` must be a 2D array with one sample: `[[4]]`
   - Feature value 4 is within bounds (4 < 7)
   - Encoded column index = `4 + feature_indices_[0]` = 4
3. `handle_unknown='error'` is safe since 4 is valid
4. Output matches: Single non-zero at (0,4) in a 1x7 matrix
