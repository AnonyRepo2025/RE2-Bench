[THOUGHT]
The output string "test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\"" is produced by `_stringify_py37` when processing a `ForwardRef` (or `_ForwardRef`) from the `typing` module. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Output Analysis**: The output contains a module name ("test_util_typing") and a quoted class name ("\"<MyClass2>\""), indicating a non-standard class representation.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - `_stringify_py37` is called from `stringify` when the annotation is not a string, `TypeVar`, `None`, etc.
   - For `typing`-module objects, it checks special attributes:
     - If `__forward_arg__` exists (as in `ForwardRef`), it uses its value directly.
     - Here, the output matches the expected `__forward_arg__` value.

3. **Why `ForwardRef`?**:
   - The output format (module + quoted class) isn't typical for standard types.
   - A `ForwardRef`'s `__forward_arg__` stores a string reference, which would bypass normal qualification and return the raw string.
   - The escaped quotes in the output confirm this is a raw string representation.

4. **Input Construction**:
   - The annotation must be a `ForwardRef`-like object with:
     - `__module__ = "typing"` (to enter the special-handling branch).
     - `__forward_arg__ = "test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\""` (to produce the output).
   - Other attributes (`_name`, `__qualname__`) are absent to ensure `__forward_arg__` is used.

Thus, the input annotation is a `typing.ForwardRef` with `__forward_arg__` set to the specified string.
