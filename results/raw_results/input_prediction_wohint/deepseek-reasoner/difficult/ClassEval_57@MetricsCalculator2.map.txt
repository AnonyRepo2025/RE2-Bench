To determine the input for the `map` method given the output `[0.0, [0.0]]`, we need to simulate the function's behavior. The output structure corresponds to the return value of the `map` method when processing a list of tuples, where the first element is the mean average precision (AP) and the second is a list of individual AP values. Here, the output indicates a mean AP of 0.0 and a single individual AP of 0.0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Output Analysis**: The output `[0.0, [0.0]]` matches the return format for a list input: `(mean_ap, list_of_aps)`, where `mean_ap = 0.0` and `list_of_aps = [0.0]`.
2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The `map` method handles two input types: a single tuple `(sub_list, total_num)` or a list of such tuples.
   - For a **list input**, it processes each tuple, computes AP for each, and returns the mean AP and the list of APs.
   - AP computation for a tuple `(sub_list, total_num)`:
     - If `total_num == 0`, AP is set to 0.0.
     - If `total_num != 0` but `sub_list` contains no non-zero elements, AP is also 0.0 (since the numerator in the calculation becomes 0).
3. **Achieving the Output**:
   - To get `mean_ap = 0.0` and `list_of_aps = [0.0]`, we need exactly one tuple in the input list that results in an AP of 0.0.
   - The simplest case is a tuple where `total_num = 0` (e.g., `([], 0)`), as this directly sets AP to 0.0 without further computation.
4. **Input Selection**:
   - Use a list with one tuple: `[ (sub_list, total_num) ]`.
   - Choose `sub_list = []` (empty list) and `total_num = 0` to ensure AP = 0.0.
   - In JSON, represent the tuple as a list: `[[], 0]`.

### Final Input:
The input `data` must be a list containing one tuple-equivalent list `[[], 0]` to trigger the list-processing branch and produce the desired output.

[THOUGHT]
The output `[0.0, [0.0]]` corresponds to the list-processing branch of the `map` method, returning a mean AP of 0.0 and a list of individual APs containing one value of 0.0. This occurs when the input is a list with one tuple `(sub_list, total_num)` where `total_num = 0` (e.g., `([], 0)`). In JSON, the tuple is represented as a list `[[], 0]`, and the overall input `data` is wrapped in a list to match the expected structure for the list branch. Thus, the input is `[[[], 0]]`.
