[THOUGHT]
The output shows an HTTP response structure that indicates a CSRF rejection occurred. Key observations:
1. The response has "text/html" content-type and empty cookies, consistent with Django's CSRF failure responses
2. The "_has_been_logged": true suggests security logging occurred
3. The rejection must be due to missing CSRF cookie (REASON_NO_CSRF_COOKIE) since:
   - Request is non-safe (POST) and not exempt
   - HTTPS referer checks are skipped because request is HTTP
   - CSRF cookie is missing in request.META
4. Required input conditions:
   - request.method = "POST" (non-safe method)
   - request.is_secure() = False (by setting wsgi.url_scheme="http")
   - No "CSRF_COOKIE" in request.META
   - callback not CSRF-exempt
   - No _dont_enforce_csrf_checks on request

This configuration triggers the REASON_NO_CSRF_COOKIE rejection path, producing the given output.
