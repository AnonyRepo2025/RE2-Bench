The output shows a dataset with 200 samples (from the y-array length) and 2 features (from the X-array shape). The y-array has four classes (0,1,2,3) with exactly 50 samples each, indicating uniform class distribution. The contiguous blocks per class in the output suggest `shuffle=False`. The data shows a linear relationship between features within each class cluster, consistent with `n_informative=2` and no redundant/repeated features. The large magnitude of values indicates `shift` and `scale` were set to `None` (using their default generation). The class separation pattern matches `hypercube=True` and `class_sep=1.0`. Key parameters:
- `n_samples=200` (output has 200 samples)
- `n_features=2` (output has 2 features)
- `n_classes=4` (4 distinct classes in y)
- `n_clusters_per_class=1` (contiguous class blocks imply one cluster per class)
- `n_informative=2`, `n_redundant=0`, `n_repeated=0` (features show informative structure)
- `flip_y=0.0` (no class flips observed)
- `shuffle=False` (classes are ordered)
- `shift=None`, `scale=None` (values are scaled beyond defaults)
Other parameters use defaults: `weights=None`, `hypercube=True`, `class_sep=1.0`, `random_state=None`.
