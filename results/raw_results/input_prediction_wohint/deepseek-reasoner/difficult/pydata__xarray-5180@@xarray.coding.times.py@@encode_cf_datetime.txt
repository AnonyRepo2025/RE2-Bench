[THOUGHT]
The output of `encode_cf_datetime` is `("10", "days since 2000-01-01", "gregorian")`. To achieve this:

1. **Output Analysis**:
   - The first element "10" represents the numeric time value (days since reference).
   - The units are "days since 2000-01-01".
   - The calendar is "gregorian".

2. **Input Requirements**:
   - `dates` must correspond to a datetime exactly 10 days after 2000-01-01 (i.e., 2000-01-11).
   - `units` must be provided as "days since 2000-01-01" to match the output (if left as `None`, inferred units would use the first date as reference).
   - `calendar` must be "gregorian" to match the output (if left as `None`, it would infer "proleptic_gregorian" for numpy datetimes, which doesn't match).

3. **Execution Path**:
   - Since `units` and `calendar` are provided, the function uses them directly.
   - The standard calendar ("gregorian") and numpy datetime path is taken.
   - The date "2000-01-11" is converted to 10 days since "2000-01-01".
   - The numeric value 10 is cast to an integer (via `cast_to_int_if_safe`).

4. **Input Representation**:
   - `dates` is provided as a string "2000-01-11" (JSON-compatible; caller must convert to datetime).
   - `units` and `calendar` are provided explicitly to match the output.

Thus, the input is:
- `dates`: "2000-01-11"
- `units`: "days since 2000-01-01"
- `calendar`: "gregorian"
