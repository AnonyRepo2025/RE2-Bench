[THOUGHT]
The output expression is "(-1 + \"sqrt(3)\"*I)*(\"sqrt(21)\" + 5)**(1/3)", which is a factored form of a more complex input expression. The function `factor_terms` factors out common terms from expressions. The output shows a product of a complex number and a cube root, suggesting the input was a sum of terms sharing the common factor (5 + √21)^(1/3).

Specifically, the output matches the factored form of:
- (5 + √21)^(1/3) + I·√3·(5 + √21)^(1/3)

When factored, this becomes:
(5 + √21)^(1/3) · (-1 + I·√3)

Which is equivalent to the given output (order of factors may vary, but content matches). The input expression should therefore be this sum. The exponent 1/3 is represented as `Rational(1,3)` to ensure exact rational handling in SymPy. The keyword arguments use default values (`radical=False`, `clear=False`, `fraction=False`, `sign=True`) as they weren't specified.
