The function `text2int` converts words representing numbers into their numerical digits. Given the output "32", the input must be a string that represents the number 32 in words. The class `Words2Numbers` recognizes words like "thirty" and "two". 

Processing steps for "thirty two":
1. Replace hyphens: "thirty two" remains unchanged.
2. Split into words: ["thirty", "two"].
3. "thirty" is in `tens` → `scale=1`, `increment=30` → `current = 0*1 + 30 = 30`.
4. "two" is in `units` → `scale=1`, `increment=2` → `current = 30*1 + 2 = 32`.
5. After processing, `onnumber=True` → append `str(32)` to `curstring`, returning "32".

Other valid inputs like "thirty-two", "thirty and two", or "thirty-second" would also produce "32" due to hyphen replacement and ordinal handling, but "thirty two" is the simplest form.

The `self` state is empty since `Words2Numbers` initializes fixed dictionaries in `__init__` with no user-settable parameters.

Thus, the input is:
```json
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "textnum": "thirty two"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
