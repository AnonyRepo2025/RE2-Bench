The output ":obj:`tests.test_util_typing.T`" indicates that the input `cls` is a type variable `T` from the module `tests.test_util_typing`. Here's the reasoning:

1. The output uses `:obj:` instead of `:class:`, which suggests it's not a standard class but a type variable (common in Sphinx for type variables).
2. The function `restify` handles several cases:
   - `None`/`NoneType` → `:obj:`None`` (doesn't match)
   - `Ellipsis` → `...` (doesn't match)
   - Built-in classes in `INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES` → `:class:...` (doesn't match)
   - `NewType` → `:class:...` (doesn't match, as `isNewType` requires specific qualname)
   - `Union` types → pipe-separated (doesn't match)
   - Built-in classes → `:class:...` (doesn't match, since module is `tests.test_util_typing`)
3. The output structure `tests.test_util_typing.T` matches a custom type variable:
   - `__module__ = "tests.test_util_typing"`
   - `__name__ = "T"`
4. `isNewType` check would fail because:
   - `__module__` is not `'typing'`
   - `__qualname__` isn't `'NewType.<locals>.new_type'`
5. The version-specific handlers (`_restify_py37`/`_restify_py36`) would generate `:obj:...` for type variables.

Thus, the input `cls` must be a type variable `T` from `tests.test_util_typing`, represented by an object with `__module__` and `__name__` attributes.
