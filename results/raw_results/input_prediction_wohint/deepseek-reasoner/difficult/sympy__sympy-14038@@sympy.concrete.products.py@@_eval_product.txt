The output is `2**Sum(2*f(k), (k, 1, n))`, which is a power expression where the base is 2 and the exponent is a summation. Analyzing the `_eval_product` function, this output matches the branch for `term.is_Pow` when the base does not depend on the index variable `k`:

```python
elif term.is_Pow:
    if not term.base.has(k):
        s = summation(term.exp, (k, a, n))
        return term.base ** s
```

For this output:
- The base is `2`, which is constant (does not depend on `k`).
- The exponent in the output is `Sum(2*f(k), (k, 1, n))`, meaning the original exponent in the input term must have been `2*f(k)` (since `summation(2*f(k), (k, 1, n))` produces this).
- The limits in the output summation are `(k, 1, n)`, so the input limits must be `(k, 1, n)`.

Thus, the input term is `2**(2*f(k))` and the limits are `(k, 1, n)`. The symbol `k` must be a variable, and `n` is a symbol representing the upper limit.
