The output is a list of two very small numbers: `-2.9416469260468148e-12` and `-7.123190925995004e-13`. These represent the pixel coordinates returned by `world_to_pixel_values`. To achieve this output:

1. **Output Analysis**: The output consists of two values, indicating that `self.pixel_n_dim` (the number of kept pixel dimensions) is 2. The values are near zero, suggesting the input world coordinates correspond to the origin of the pixel grid after slicing adjustments.

2. **Key Components of `self`**:
   - `_wcs`: The underlying WCS object. For simplicity, assume it's an identity transformation (world coordinates map directly to pixel coordinates). Set `world_n_dim=2` and `pixel_n_dim=2`.
   - `_slices_pixel`: Defines how pixel dimensions are sliced. To ensure adjustments (subtracting slice starts) don't change values, set all slice starts to 0. Represent each slice as `{"start": 0}` since only `.start` is used in the code.
   - `_pixel_keep`: Indices of pixel dimensions retained after slicing. Set to `[0, 1]` to keep both dimensions.
   - `_world_keep`: Indices of world dimensions retained. Set to `[0, 1]` to match the input world arrays.

3. **Input World Arrays**: The output values must match the input world coordinates due to the identity WCS and zero slice adjustments. Thus, the input `world_arrays` should be the output values converted to floats.

4. **Simulation**:
   - `sliced_out_world_coords` is computed as `(0, 0)` (origin for dropped dimensions).
   - `world_arrays_new` becomes `[input[0], input[1]` (since both dimensions are kept).
   - Underlying WCS returns `(input[0], input[1])` (identity).
   - Slice adjustments subtract 0 (no change).
   - Kept pixel dimensions are `(input[0], input[1])`, matching the output.

Thus, the input `world_arrays` are the output values, and `self` is configured for an identity transformation with zero slice offsets.
