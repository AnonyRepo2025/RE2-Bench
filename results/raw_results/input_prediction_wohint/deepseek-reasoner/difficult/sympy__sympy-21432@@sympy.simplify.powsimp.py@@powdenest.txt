[THOUGHT]
The output is a string "_x", which represents a symbol. The function `powdenest` denests power expressions, but a symbol like `_x` has no powers to denest. Therefore, the function would return the symbol unchanged regardless of the `force` and `polar` parameters. 

Simulating the execution:
1. If `force=True`, the function checks for nested powers in `eq`. Since a symbol has no powers, no substitutions occur. Then `posify` is called, which for a symbol returns the symbol and an empty replacement dictionary. The recursive call to `powdenest` with `force=False` and `polar=False` would return the symbol unchanged, and `xreplace` with an empty dictionary leaves it as `_x`.
2. If `force=False` and `polar=False`, `powsimp` is called on the symbol, which returns the symbol unchanged. The `Transform` with `_denest_pow` would not apply since there are no `Pow` or `exp` nodes.
3. If `polar=True`, `polarify` returns the symbol and an empty replacement dictionary. `unpolarify` on the symbol returns itself, and the inner `powdenest` call returns the symbol. The final `unpolarify` with an empty dictionary leaves it as `_x`.

Thus, the simplest input that produces `_x` is the symbol `_x` itself, with `force` and `polar` set to their defaults (`False`). The symbol can be represented as a string `"_x"` since `sympify` in the function will convert it to a SymPy symbol.
