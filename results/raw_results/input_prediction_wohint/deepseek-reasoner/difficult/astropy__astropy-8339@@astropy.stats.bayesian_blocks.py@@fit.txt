The output is the edges at the change points: [4.36037718, 48.45689469, 52.59791734, 99.45505108]. These edges are derived from the input array `t` and correspond to specific indices determined by the Bayesian Blocks algorithm. 

1. **Edge Construction**: The edges are built as:
   - `edges[0] = t[0]`
   - `edges[1] = (t[0] + t[1]) / 2`
   - `edges[2] = (t[1] + t[2]) / 2`
   - `edges[3] = (t[2] + t[3]) / 2` (for N=4)
   - `edges[4] = t[3]`

2. **Output Analysis**: The output edges are:
   - `edges[0] = 4.36037718` → `t[0] = 4.36037718`
   - `edges[1] = 48.45689469` → `(t[0] + t[1]) / 2 = 48.45689469`
   - `edges[2] = 52.59791734` → `(t[1] + t[2]) / 2 = 52.59791734`
   - `edges[4] = 99.45505108` → `t[3] = 99.45505108`

3. **Solve for `t`**:
   - From `edges[1]`:  
     `(4.36037718 + t[1]) / 2 = 48.45689469`  
     `t[1] = 2 * 48.45689469 - 4.36037718 = 92.5534122`
   - From `edges[2]`:  
     `(92.5534122 + t[2]) / 2 = 52.59791734`  
     `t[2] = 2 * 52.59791734 - 92.5534122 = 12.64242248`
   - `t[3] = 99.45505108` (directly from `edges[4]`)

   Thus, `t = [4.36037718, 92.5534122, 12.64242248, 99.45505108]`.

4. **Change Points**: The output edges correspond to indices [0, 1, 2, 4] in the edges array. This requires the algorithm to select these indices during backtracking. To achieve this:
   - Use `x = [1, 1, 1, 1]` and `sigma = [1, 1, 1, 1]` for simplicity, as the cumulative sums in the fitness calculation will be uniform, increasing the likelihood of the desired change points under the algorithm's logic.

5. **Input Structure**: The function `fit` is called as `fit(t, x, sigma)`. Following the example, the input JSON includes:
   - `self`: Set to `null` (state not specified).
   - `args`: Dictionary with `t`, `x`, and `sigma` (positional arguments by name).
   - `kwargs`: Empty, as no keyword arguments are needed.

This input will produce the edges at indices [0, 1, 2, 4], matching the output.
