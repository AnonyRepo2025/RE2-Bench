[THOUGHT]
The output shows a dictionary with key "(0, 0, 1, 1, 3)" mapped to `null`, indicating that one or more symbols in the input expression have the fingerprint (0, 0, 1, 1, 3). This fingerprint means:
- Index 0 (top-level symbol): 0 occurrences
- Index 1 (top-level negation): 0 occurrences
- Index 2 (symbol in non-leaf node): 1 occurrence
- Index 3 (negated symbol in non-leaf node): 1 occurrence
- Index 4 (complexity weight): 3

To achieve this:
1. The expression must be a Boolean operation (e.g., `And`, `Or`) with arguments.
2. The fingerprint suggests:
   - A symbol appears once directly in a non-leaf node (index2=1)
   - The same symbol appears once negated within a non-leaf node (index3=1)
   - The complexity weight 3 comes from a node with 2 arguments where one is a `Not`
3. The expression `And(Or(x, Not(x)))` fits:
   - Top-level: `And` with one argument `Or(x, Not(x))`
   - For `Or(x, Not(x))`:
     - `o = len(args) + number of Not = 2 + 1 = 3`
     - `x` (symbol): increments index2 by 1 and index4 by 3
     - `Not(x)`: increments index3 for `x` by 1
   - Resulting fingerprint for `x`: (0, 0, 1, 1, 3)

Thus, the input expression is `And(Or(x, Not(x)))` where `x` is a symbol.
