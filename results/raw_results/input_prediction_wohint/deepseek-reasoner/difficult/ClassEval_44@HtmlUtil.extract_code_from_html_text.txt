[THOUGHT]
The goal is to determine the input `html_text` for the `extract_code_from_html_text` method that produces the given output. The output contains two code strings: `"print('Hello, world!')"` and `"for i in range(4):\n                print(i)"`.

Analyzing the method:
1. `extract_code_from_html_text` first calls `format_line_html_text(html_text)`, which processes the HTML:
   - Replaces content inside `<pre>` or `<blockquote>` tags with `-CODE-`.
   - Processes list items (`<li>`) and paragraphs (`<p>`) for punctuation.
   - Returns cleaned text with code blocks marked as `-CODE-`.
2. If `-CODE-` is present in the cleaned text, the method:
   - Re-parses the original `html_text` to find all `<pre>` and `<blockquote>` tags.
   - Extracts the text content of these tags and returns them as a list.

Given the output has two code strings, the input HTML must contain two code blocks (either `<pre>` or `<blockquote>` tags) with exactly the provided content. The order of tags in the HTML must match the output order.

The HTML must:
- Have a first code block containing `print('Hello, world!')`.
- Have a second code block containing `for i in range(4):\n                print(i)` (with preserved whitespace/newline).
- Use `<pre>` tags to maintain whitespace fidelity (though `<blockquote>` could work, `<pre>` is safer for whitespace).

The `self` object requires default attributes from `HtmlUtil.__init__` since they're used in processing (e.g., `CODE_MARK = '-CODE-'`). The rest of the HTML can be minimal since only code blocks are extracted.

Thus, a valid `html_text` is:
```html
<pre>print('Hello, world!')</pre>
<pre>for i in range(4):
                print(i)</pre>
```
This will be parsed as two code blocks, producing the output when extracted.
