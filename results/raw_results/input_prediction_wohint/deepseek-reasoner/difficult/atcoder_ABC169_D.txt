The code reads an integer input `x`, factorizes it into prime factors, and calculates the sum of the "triangular representation" indices for each prime exponent. The output is 2, meaning the sum of these indices is 2.

The triangular index `j` for an exponent `num` is the largest integer such that the sum of the first `j` natural numbers (i.e., \( T_j = j(j+1)/2 \)) is less than or equal to `num`:
- For `num = 1`, `j = 1`.
- For `num = 2`, `j = 1` (since \( T_1 = 1 \leq 2 \) and \( T_2 = 3 > 2 \)).
- For `num = 3`, `j = 2` (since \( T_2 = 3 \leq 3 \)).
- For `num = 4` or `5`, `j = 2` (since \( T_2 = 3 \leq 4 \) or \( 5 \), but \( T_3 = 6 > 4 \) or \( 5 \)).
- For `num = 6`, `j = 3` (since \( T_3 = 6 \leq 6 \)).

The sum of the indices (`ans`) is 2. Possible cases:
1. One prime factor with exponent in {3, 4, 5} (yielding `j = 2`).
2. Two prime factors, each with exponent 1 or 2 (yielding `j = 1` for each, summing to 2).

The smallest integer satisfying these conditions is 6:
- Factorization: \( 6 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \).
- For exponent 1 (2): `j = 1`.
- For exponent 1 (3): `j = 1`.
- Sum: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \).

Thus, the input string is "6".
