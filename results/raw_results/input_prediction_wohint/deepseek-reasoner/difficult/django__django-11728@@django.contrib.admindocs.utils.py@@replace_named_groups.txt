[THOUGHT]
The function `replace_named_groups` processes a regex pattern by replacing named groups (e.g., `(?P<name>...)`) with just the group name (e.g., `name`). Given the output `"admin/password_change/done/"`, the input pattern must have contained a named group that, when replaced, resulted in this string. 

- The output contains three segments: `admin/`, `password_change/`, and `done/`. Since `password_change` appears as a literal in the output, it must have been produced by replacing a named group with the group name `password_change`.
- The original pattern likely had a named group `(?P<password_change>...)` in the position of `password_change`. The inner pattern (e.g., `...`) is irrelevant for the output since the entire group is replaced by the group name.
- The simplest valid pattern that produces the output is `"admin/(?P<password_change>pattern_here)/done/"`, where `pattern_here` is replaced by `password_change`. Using `password_change` as the inner pattern ensures the replacement results in the exact output.
- Thus, the input pattern is `"admin/(?P<password_change>password_change)/done/"`.

Verification:
- The named group `(?P<password_change>password_change)` is replaced by `password_change`.
- The resulting string is `admin/password_change/done/`, matching the output.
