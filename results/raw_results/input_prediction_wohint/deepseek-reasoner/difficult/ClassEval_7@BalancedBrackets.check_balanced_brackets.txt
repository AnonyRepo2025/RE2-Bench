[THOUGHT]
The `BalancedBrackets` class checks if an expression has balanced brackets. The method `check_balanced_brackets` returns `False` for unbalanced expressions. Given the output is `false`, the input expression must be unbalanced and must not cause an exception (e.g., popping from an empty stack). 

The expression "([)]" is unbalanced because:
- '(' is pushed onto the stack.
- '[' is pushed onto the stack.
- When encountering ')', the stack pops '[' (the last element), but '[' requires ']' to close, not ')', causing a mismatch and returning `False`.

This expression avoids exceptions since the stack isn't empty when popping. Thus, the input expression is "([)]", initialized in the object, and the method is called with no arguments.
