[THOUGHT]
The output shows a matrix with `_rows=2`, `_cols=2`, and `_mat=null`. This suggests the result is a 2x2 matrix with no explicit data, likely indicating a symbolic zero matrix. The function `_matrix_derivative` computes the derivative of a matrix expression `expr` with respect to `x`. 

Key observations:
1. The output dimensions (2x2) match the input matrix `expr`'s shape, as matrix derivatives preserve shape.
2. `_mat=null` implies the result is a symbolic zero matrix, meaning `expr` does not depend on `x`.
3. For the derivative to be zero, `expr` must be a constant matrix (no dependence on `x`).

Given this, the input should be:
- `expr`: A 2x2 constant matrix (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`).
- `x`: A symbol not present in `expr` (e.g., `"x"`).

This ensures the derivative is a 2x2 zero matrix, matching the output structure.
