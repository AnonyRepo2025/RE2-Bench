[THOUGHT]
The output shows a sparse matrix with shape (2, 4) and one non-zero value at position (1, 1). This indicates:
1. The encoder has 4 output features (columns), likely from one input feature with 4 categories.
2. The first row has all zeros, meaning the input contained an unknown category (handled via `handle_unknown='ignore'`).
3. The second row has a single "1" at column 1, meaning the input was the second category of the first feature.

To achieve this:
- The encoder must be fitted with `categories_=[['A','B','C','D']]` and `handle_unknown='ignore'`.
- The input `X` should be a 2x1 array: first row with an unknown value ('E'), second row with the second category ('B').

The encoder state requires:
- `categories_` set to the known categories.
- `handle_unknown='ignore'` to mask unknowns.
- `_infrequent_enabled=False` (no infrequent handling).
- `_drop_idx_after_grouping=None` (no dropped categories).
- `_n_features_outs=[4]` (4 output features per input).
- `n_features_in_=1` (1 input feature).
