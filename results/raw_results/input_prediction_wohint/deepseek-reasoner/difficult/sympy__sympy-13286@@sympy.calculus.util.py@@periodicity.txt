[THOUGHT]
The output "2*pi" is the period of a trigonometric function. The function `periodicity` returns the period of a given function `f` with respect to a symbol. Common trigonometric functions like `sin(x)` or `cos(x)` have a period of `2*pi`. 

Steps to derive the input:
1. The output is "2*pi", which is the fundamental period of basic trigonometric functions.
2. The function `periodicity` handles trigonometric functions directly. For example:
   - `sin(x)` has period `2*pi`
   - `cos(x)` has period `2*pi`
3. The function uses `simplify` on the input, so the expression can be provided as a string or SymPy object. A string like "sin(x)" is valid.
4. The symbol must be specified (e.g., "x").
5. The `check` parameter is optional and defaults to `False`, so it can be omitted.

Thus, the simplest input that produces "2*pi" is `f = "sin(x)"` and `symbol = "x"`.
