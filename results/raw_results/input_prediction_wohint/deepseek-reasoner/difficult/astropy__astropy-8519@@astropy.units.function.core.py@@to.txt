The output is 100.0, which is the result of the `to` method. To achieve this:

1. The simplest path is when `other` equals `self.physical_unit`, triggering the first branch: `return self.to_physical(value)`. 
2. For this to yield 100.0, set `value = 100.0` and assume `self.to_physical(100.0)` returns 100.0 (identity function).
3. Represent `self.physical_unit` as a string "m" (meter) for simplicity, and set `other` to the same string "m" to satisfy the identity check (assuming the unit system treats identical strings as the same object).
4. Omit `equivalencies` to use the default empty list.

Thus, the input requires:
- `self` with `physical_unit` set to "m"
- `args` with `other` as "m" and `value` as 100.0
- `kwargs` remains empty
