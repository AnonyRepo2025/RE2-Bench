[THOUGHT]
The output is `true`, meaning the `__eq__` method returned `True`. To achieve this:

1. The `other` argument must be successfully sympified into an `Expr` instance.
2. Both `self` and `other` must be of the same type (unless both are numbers, but this case avoids numbers).
3. Their `_hashable_content()` must be identical.
4. For each item in `_hashable_content()`, if it's a number `Expr`, its type must match the corresponding item in the other object.

The simplest case is two empty `Expr` instances:
- `Expr()` creates an object with `_args = ()`.
- `_hashable_content()` returns `()`, which is identical for both.
- There are no items to iterate over in the loop, so no mismatches occur.
- Types match since both are `Expr`.

Thus, the input should have:
- `self` as an `Expr` with `_args` as an empty list (representing an empty tuple).
- `other` as an `Expr` with `_args` as an empty list.

This satisfies all conditions for `__eq__` to return `True`.
