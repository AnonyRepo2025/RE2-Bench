[THOUGHT]
The function `fraction(expr, exact=False)` processes an expression by breaking it into multiplicative terms and separates them into numerator and denominator components. Given the output `["-x**3", "1"]`, the numerator is `-x**3` and the denominator is `1`. 

To achieve this:
1. The expression must be a product of terms where:
   - The constant `-1` is treated as a `Rational`, splitting into numerator `-1` and denominator `1`.
   - The term `x**3` is a `Pow` with a positive exponent, so it remains in the numerator.
2. After processing:
   - Numerator factors: `[-1, x**3]` → `Mul(-1, x**3) = -x**3`.
   - Denominator factors: `[1]` → `1`.
3. The simplest input that produces this is `-x**3`, as:
   - `sympify("-x**3")` creates the expression `Mul(-1, Pow(x, 3))`.
   - Processing yields `-x**3` for the numerator and `1` for the denominator.

Alternative expressions like `-x**3/1` or `x**3 * -1` also work but are equivalent. The string `"-x**3"` is the most straightforward input.
