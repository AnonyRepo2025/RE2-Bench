The output shows a `PartialDerivative` object with `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` set to `null`. This state occurs when the `_contract_indices_for_derivative` method returns `(args, None, None, None)`. For this to happen:

1. **Input Analysis**: The `_expand_partial_derivative` method is called on a `PartialDerivative` instance. The output state (`_indices: null`, etc.) suggests the object was created without setting these attributes (bypassing the normal `__new__` constructor logic).

2. **Key Condition**: The method `_contract_indices_for_derivative` returns `None` for `indices`, `free`, and `dum` when:
   - The `expr` (first argument) is a non-tensor (e.g., a scalar/constant).
   - The `variables` are non-tensors (e.g., `Symbol` types).
   - This causes `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices` to return empty lists for `indices`, `free`, and `dum` (which are treated as `None` in the output JSON).

3. **Early Termination**: The method checks `if not args[0].free_symbols` (i.e., `expr` has no free symbols). If true, it returns `S.Zero`, leaving the object's attributes unchanged. For this, `expr` must be a constant (e.g., `0`).

4. **Input Structure**: The input `self` must:
   - Have `_indices`, `_free`, and `dum` as `null`.
   - Contain `args = [expr, *variables]` where `expr` is a constant (e.g., `0`) and `variables` is a list of `Symbols` (e.g., `[x, y]`).

Thus, the input is a `PartialDerivative` instance with `expr=0`, variables like `[x, y]`, and attributes explicitly set to `null`.
