[THOUGHT]
The function `_encode_params` processes input data for URL encoding. Given the output string "z=1&a=1&k=1&d=1", the input must satisfy one of the function's branches:

1. **String/bytes branch**: If the input is a string or bytes, it's returned directly. The output matches exactly, so the input could be the string "z=1&a=1&k=1&d=1".
   
2. **Iterable branch**: If the input is iterable (e.g., list of tuples), it's processed into key-value pairs. However:
   - Keys/values would be encoded to bytes (e.g., `b'z'`, `b'1'`), and `urlencode` might return bytes, not a string.
   - Order matters (z, a, k, d), requiring an ordered structure like `OrderedDict` or list of tuples. But encoding issues make this branch unreliable for producing a string output.

Given the output is a string, the simplest and most reliable input is the string itself. The function will return it directly via the first branch, avoiding encoding complexities.

Thus, the input `data` should be the string "z=1&a=1&k=1&d=1". Since `_encode_params` is a static method, `self` is `null`, and `data` is passed as a named argument in `args`.
