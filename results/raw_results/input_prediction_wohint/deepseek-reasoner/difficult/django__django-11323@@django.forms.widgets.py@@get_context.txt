The output shows the context dictionary returned by `SelectDateWidget.get_context()`, with:
- `name` = "mydate"
- `is_hidden` = false (since input_type is 'select')
- `required` = false (from widget's is_required)
- `value` = {"year": null, "month": null, "day": null} (from format_value)
- `attrs` = {} (combined from widget's attrs and passed attrs)
- `template_name` = "django/forms/widgets/select_date.html" (class default)

To achieve this:
1. `name` must be "mydate" to match output.
2. `value` must be None or an unparsable string to get all nulls in format_value. Using None is simplest.
3. `attrs` must be None or {} so combined attrs is {} (assuming widget's base attrs is {}).
4. Widget instance (self) must have:
   - `is_required` = false (to match output)
   - `attrs` = {} (base attrs)
   - `input_type` = "select" (to make is_hidden false)

The output's `subwidgets: null` is inconsistent with code (should be a list), but we prioritize matching the controllable fields.
