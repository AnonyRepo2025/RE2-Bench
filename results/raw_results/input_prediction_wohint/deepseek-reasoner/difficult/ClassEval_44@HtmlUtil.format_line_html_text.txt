[THOUGHT]
The output is "[-]Item 1.", which matches the formatting applied to list items (`<li>` tags) in the `format_line_html_text` method. The function processes HTML by:
1. Replacing content of `<pre>` and `<blockquote>` tags with `-CODE-` (not present in output)
2. Formatting list items (`<li>` tags):
   - If text doesn't end with punctuation, it becomes `[-]{text}.`
   - "Item 1" has no trailing punctuation â†’ becomes `[-]Item 1.`
3. Processing paragraphs (`<p>` tags) is not involved here
4. Extracting text and normalizing newlines (output has no newlines)

The output contains no other text or `-CODE-` markers, so the input HTML must be a simple list with one item having the text "Item 1". The list type (ordered/unordered) doesn't affect formatting since both use `[-]`. Minimal HTML without newlines is required to avoid extra whitespace in output.

The instance requires `CODE_MARK` attribute (set to `-CODE-` by `__init__`) for code tag replacement, though not used here. Other instance attributes aren't accessed.
