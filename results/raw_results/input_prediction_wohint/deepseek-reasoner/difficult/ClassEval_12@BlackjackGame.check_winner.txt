The output is "Player wins". The `check_winner` method determines the winner based on hand values and bust conditions. The output occurs in three possible scenarios:

1. **Both bust and player_value ≤ dealer_value**:  
   Example: Player=22, Dealer=23 → Player wins.

2. **Dealer busts, player does not**:  
   Example: Player=19 (≤21), Dealer=23 (>21) → Player wins.

3. **Neither bust and player_value > dealer_value**:  
   Example: Player=20, Dealer=19 → Player wins.

I choose **Scenario 2** for simplicity.  
- **Player hand**: ["10H", "9D"] → Value = 10 + 9 = 19 (not bust).  
- **Dealer hand**: ["10S", "6C", "7H"] → Value = 10 + 6 + 7 = 23 (bust).  

The `self` state is set to initial values (from `__init__`):  
- `deck` is empty (since `create_deck` isn't defined, and it's unused).  
- `player_hand` and `dealer_hand` are empty (unused in the method).  

The arguments:  
- `player_hand`: ["10H", "9D"]  
- `dealer_hand`: ["10S", "6C", "7H"]  

This input produces "Player wins" because the dealer busts while the player does not.
