[THOUGHT]
The output shows the state after calling `_set_params` with:
- `transformers: null`
- `remainder: "drop"`
- `n_jobs: 2`
- `transformer_weights: null`

To achieve this:
1. `transformers` is set via the `attr` parameter (which is `'_transformers'` for `ColumnTransformer`). Passing `_transformers=None` in `kwargs` sets `self._transformers = None`, which appears as `transformers: null` in the output.
2. `remainder`, `n_jobs`, and `transformer_weights` are set directly via `super().set_params()`, so they must be included in `kwargs`.
3. The `attr` argument must be `'_transformers'` to target the correct attribute.
4. Since `transformers` is set to `None`, there are no estimator names to process, so no additional parameters are needed.

Thus, the input `kwargs` must include `_transformers=None`, `remainder='drop'`, `n_jobs=2`, and `transformer_weights=None`, with `attr='_transformers'` in `args`.
