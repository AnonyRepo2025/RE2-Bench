[THOUGHT]
The output is "2*I*sin(2*_Dummy_588)". The function `_osborne(e, d)` replaces hyperbolic functions with trigonometric functions by scaling the argument by `d`. Specifically:
- `sinh(x)` becomes `I*sin(d*x)`
- The output contains `I*sin(2*_Dummy_588)`, indicating it came from `sinh` replacement.
- The factor `2` in the output must come from the original expression.

Thus, the input expression `e` must be `2*sinh(k)`, where `k` is the argument. After replacement, it becomes `2*I*sin(d*k)`. Matching this to the output `2*I*sin(2*_Dummy_588)` gives:
- `d*k = 2*_Dummy_588`
- Choosing `d=1` (simplest case), then `k = 2*_Dummy_588`
- Therefore, `e = 2*sinh(2*_Dummy_588)`

The dummy variable `_Dummy_588` must be consistent between input and output since `_osborne` doesn't change symbols, only scales arguments.
