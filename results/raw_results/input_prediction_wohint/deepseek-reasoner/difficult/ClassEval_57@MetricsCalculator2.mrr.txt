The output is `[0.25, [0.25]]`, which matches the return structure of the `mrr` method when called with a list of one query tuple. The method computes the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for each query and returns the average MRR and the list of individual MRR scores.

To achieve an MRR of 0.25 for a single query:
- The reciprocal rank is calculated as \( \frac{1}{r} \), where \( r \) is the rank of the first relevant document.
- For \( \frac{1}{r} = 0.25 \), the rank \( r \) must be 4 (since \( \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \)).
- This means the first relevant document (represented by a value > 0) should be at the 4th position (0-based index 3) in the relevance list.
- The relevance list should have zeros for the first three positions and a non-zero value (e.g., 1) at the fourth position: `[0, 0, 0, 1]`.
- The `total_num` (total documents) must be non-zero to avoid returning 0.0; any value like 4 works.

The input `data` is a list containing one query tuple: `(sub_list, total_num) = ([0, 0, 0, 1], 4)`. In JSON, this is represented as a list of lists: `[[[0, 0, 0, 1], 4]]`.

Since `mrr` is a static method and the class has no instance attributes, `self` is an empty dictionary. The function is called with `data` as a positional argument, so `args` contains `data`, and there are no keyword arguments (`kwargs` is empty).
