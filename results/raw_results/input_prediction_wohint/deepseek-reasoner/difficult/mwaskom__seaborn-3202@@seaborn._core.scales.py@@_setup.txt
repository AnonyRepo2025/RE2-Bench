The output shows the state of the `Nominal` object after `_setup` is called. Key observations:
1. The output has `_tick_params` and `_label_params` non-null (with `"locator": null` and `"formatter": null`), meaning the initial `self` already had these set, so the `tick()` and `label()` calls were skipped.
2. `_legend` is `[null, null]`, indicating `prop.legend` was `False` (since the method only sets `_legend` if `prop.legend` is truthy).
3. `_matplotlib_scale` is an empty object `{}`, consistent with the `CatScale` instance created in the method.
4. `_pipeline` is `null` and `_spacer` is `{}` (representing a function). This suggests `prop.get_mapping(new, data)` might have returned `None`, or the pipeline setup was skipped, but the method sets `_pipeline` unconditionally. Given the output, we prioritize matching the state.
5. `values` and `order` remain `null`, so the initial `self` had these as `null`.

Input reconstruction:
- `self` must have:  
  - `values: null`  
  - `order: null`  
  - `_tick_params: {"locator": null}`  
  - `_label_params: {"formatter": null}`  
  - `_legend: [null, null]` (to persist after method if `prop.legend=False`).  
- `data`: A pandas `Series` (e.g., `Series(["a", "b", "c"])` with name `"test"` for `CatScale`).  
- `prop`: Must have `legend: false` and a `get_mapping` method (which may return `None`).  
- `axis`: `None` (triggers pseudo-axis creation in the method).  

The method uses `data.name` and `categorical_order(data, order)`, so `data` needs a name and values. The exact data doesn't affect the output structure, so we use a simple example.
