[THOUGHT]
The output "0.e+0" represents a floating-point zero in scientific notation. To achieve this output from `_eval_evalf`, the input expression must evaluate to zero. The function handles `Add` and `Mul` expressions specially by splitting them into independent and dependent parts. For an `Add` expression like `Add(0, 0, evaluate=False)`, the `as_independent` method identifies both terms as independent (since they contain no symbols), returning `(Add(0, 0), 0)`. The condition `tail is self.identity` (where `self.identity` is 0 for `Add`) is true, so the special handling is skipped. The fallback path evaluates each argument to `Float(0, prec)`, resulting in `Add(0.0, 0.0)`, which simplifies to `Float(0)`. The string representation of `Float(0)` is "0.e+0" in scientific notation. The precision value (e.g., 15) does not affect the output since zero is represented the same at any precision.

Thus, the input is:
- `self`: An `Add` instance with arguments `[0, 0]` and `is_commutative=True`.
- `prec`: 15 (arbitrary, as it doesn't change the zero result).
