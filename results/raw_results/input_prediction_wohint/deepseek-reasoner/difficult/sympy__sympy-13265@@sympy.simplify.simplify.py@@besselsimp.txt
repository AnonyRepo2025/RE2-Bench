The output indicates that the result of `besselsimp` contains a function whose `nargs` attribute is a frozenset containing the integer 2. In SymPy, Bessel functions like `besselj`, `bessely`, `besseli`, and `besselk` have `nargs = frozenset({2})` because they take exactly two arguments (order and argument). 

The function `besselsimp` simplifies expressions involving Bessel functions. For the output to show a frozenset({2}) in `nargs._elements`, the simplified expression must contain a Bessel function that:
1. Is not rewritten to another function (e.g., due to argument factors like `I` or `-1`).
2. Is not expanded (e.g., because its order is not a half-integer or integer >1).

A suitable input is a simple Bessel function call with symbolic order and argument (e.g., `besselj(x, y)`), where:
- `x` is a non-integer, non-half-integer symbol (to avoid expansion).
- `y` is a symbol without factors like `I`, `-1`, or complex exponentials (to avoid rewriting).

This input will pass through `besselsimp` unchanged, preserving the Bessel function, which has `nargs = frozenset({2})`. The output structure matches the serialized representation of this attribute.
