[THOUGHT]
The problem requires predicting the input for the `prepare` method given that the output is `null`. The `prepare` method processes an infix expression into postfix notation, storing the result in `self.postfix_stack`, but it does not return any value (i.e., it returns `None`). The output `null` corresponds to this return value of `None`.

Since the output is always `None` regardless of the input expression, the input is not uniquely determined by the output alone. However, the simplest valid input that satisfies the output condition is an empty string (`""`). For an empty string:
- The method initializes `op_stack` with `[',']`.
- The expression is split into an empty list of characters, so the loop does not iterate.
- No operators or operands are processed, so `self.postfix_stack` remains empty.
- The final cleanup pops operators until `','` is found (which is at the top), so no changes occur.
- The method returns `None`, matching the given output.

The initial state of the `ExpressionCalculator` instance is set by `__init__`: `postfix_stack` is an empty deque, and `operat_priority` is `[0, 3, 2, 1, -1, 1, 0, 2]`. This state is used as the `self` parameter.

Thus, the input expression is `""`, with the initial object state.
