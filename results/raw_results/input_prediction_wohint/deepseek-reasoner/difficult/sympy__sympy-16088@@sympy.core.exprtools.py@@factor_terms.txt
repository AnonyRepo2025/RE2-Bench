The output is "R3 + R4 + 4050", which is a simplified sum expression. The function `factor_terms` factors out common terms from expressions. Since the output shows no common factors (R3, R4, and 4050 share no common factors), the input must be an expression that, after factoring, simplifies to this form. 

Key observations:
1. `factor_terms` processes expressions recursively:
   - For atomic/non-Basic types, returns as-is.
   - For Pow/Function/iterables, rebuilds with processed args.
   - For Add types, extracts content/primitive parts and applies `gcd_terms`.
2. The output suggests no common factors were present or extracted (since the terms remain distinct). Thus, the input likely had no extractable common factors beyond 1.
3. The simplest input producing this output is the expression itself: `R3 + R4 + 4050`. Passing this string to `factor_terms`:
   - `sympify` converts it to a SymPy Add expression.
   - `as_content_primitive` returns `(1, R3 + R4 + 4050)`.
   - Since the primitive part is Add, `gcd_terms` leaves it unchanged (no common factors).
   - `_keep_coeff(1, ...)` returns the primitive part directly â†’ `R3 + R4 + 4050`.
4. Optional parameters (`radical`, `clear`, `fraction`, `sign`) are omitted (default values suffice).

Thus, the input is the string `"R3 + R4 + 4050"`.
