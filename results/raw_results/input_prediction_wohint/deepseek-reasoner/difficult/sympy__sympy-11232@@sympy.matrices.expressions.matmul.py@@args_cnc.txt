The output of `args_cnc` is `[null, null]`, which corresponds to `(None, None)` in Python. To achieve this:

1. The `args_cnc` method first calls `self.as_coeff_matrices()`, which returns `(coeff, matrices)`. For the output to be `(None, None)`, both `coeff` and `matrices` must lead to `None` in the final return.

2. In `as_coeff_matrices`:
   - `scalars = [x for x in self.args if not x.is_Matrix]`
   - `matrices = [x for x in self.args if x.is_Matrix]`
   - `coeff = Mul(*scalars)`

3. For `coeff` to be `None`, `scalars` must contain `None` (since `Mul(*[None])` evaluates to `None`). This requires at least one non-matrix argument to be `None`.

4. For `matrices` to be `None`, it must be set to `None` directly, but it's derived from a list comprehension. However, if `self.args` contains `None` and it's classified as a matrix (which it isn't by default), this might not work. Instead, the return value `coeff_nc + matrices` must be `None`. This happens if both `coeff_nc` and `matrices` are `None`.

5. When `coeff` is `None`, calling `coeff.args_cnc()` would typically raise an error, but if we assume it returns `(None, None)` (e.g., due to error handling), then:
   - `coeff_c = None`
   - `coeff_nc = None`
   - `coeff_nc + matrices = None + matrices`. If `matrices` is `None`, this becomes `None`.

6. For `matrices` to be `None`, `self.args` must include `None` and classify it as a matrix. However, `None` is not a matrix, so `matrices` would typically be `[]`. To resolve this, we assume an edge case where `None` is force-treated as a matrix, making `matrices = [None]` but then adjusted to `None` in the context.

7. Thus, the input `self` must be a `MatMul` instance with `args` containing `None`, created with `evaluate=False` to prevent sympification errors. This allows `None` to appear in the arguments.

8. The method call `args_cnc` has no positional arguments (`args = []`) and no keyword arguments (`kwargs = {}`).
