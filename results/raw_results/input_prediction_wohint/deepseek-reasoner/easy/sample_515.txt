[THOUGHT]
The function `f` performs three operations on the input array:
1. Creates a copy of the input array.
2. Reverses the copied array.
3. Replaces each element in the reversed array with its double.

Given the output `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`, this is the result after all operations. To find the original input:
- The output is the doubled version of the reversed array. So, before doubling, the array was `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` (since 10/2=5, 8/2=4, etc.).
- This reversed array (`[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`) came from reversing the original input. Reversing it back gives the original array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Verification:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Copy: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- After reversal: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
- After doubling: `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]` (matches output).

Thus, the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
