[THOUGHT]
The `extract_file` method returns `True` when the file extraction from the zip archive is successful. The output given is `true`, indicating the extraction completed without errors. For this to happen:
1. The zip file specified in `self.file_name` must exist and be valid.
2. The `file_name` argument (file inside the zip) must exist in the archive.
3. The `output_path` must be a valid directory with write permissions.

Since the output doesn't specify which files/paths were used, I'll assume common default values that satisfy the conditions:
- `self.file_name`: A valid zip file (e.g., "archive.zip")
- `file_name`: A file that exists in the zip (e.g., "file.txt")
- `output_path`: A writable directory (e.g., ".")

These values would result in a successful extraction and return `True`.
