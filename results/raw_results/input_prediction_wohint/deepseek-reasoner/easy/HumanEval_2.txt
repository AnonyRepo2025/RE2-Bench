The function `truncate_number` computes the fractional part of a floating-point number using `number % 1.0`. The output is `0.5`, which represents the fractional part of the input. 

- The operation `number % 1.0` returns the remainder after division by 1, equivalent to the fractional component of `number`.
- For the output to be `0.5`, the input must be a float where the fractional part is exactly `0.5`. This can be satisfied by any number of the form `n + 0.5` (where `n` is an integer), such as `0.5`, `1.5`, `-0.5`, etc.
- Since the problem requires predicting a specific input and the simplest case aligns with the output value, the minimal non-negative example (`0.5`) is chosen. This avoids unnecessary complexity and matches the pattern from the provided example where minimal inputs were used.

Thus, the input `number` is `0.5`.
