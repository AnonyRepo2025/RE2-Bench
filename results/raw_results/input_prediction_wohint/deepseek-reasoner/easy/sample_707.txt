The function `f` takes a string `text` and an integer `position`. The output is "udbs l", which has 6 characters. Since the function removes one character from `text`, the original `text` must have been 7 characters long.

The function computes:
- `length = len(text)` → 7
- `index = position % (length + 1)` → `position % 8`
- If `position < 0` or `index < 0`, set `index = -1`
- Then, it removes the character at `index` from `text`

Given that the output is "udbs l", we consider two cases for `index`:

1. **`index = -1` (removes last character)**: This occurs if `position < 0` (since `position % 8` is non-negative in Python, only `position < 0` triggers this). The original text would be "udbs l" + one extra character (e.g., 'x') → "udbs lx". Removing the last character gives "udbs l".

2. **`index` in 0-6 (removes character at that index)**: For non-negative `position` where `position % 8` is 0-6. The original text would be the output with an extra character inserted at `index`. For example, if `index=0`, text = "x" + "udbs l" = "xudbs l", and removing the first character gives "udbs l".

Both cases are valid, but we choose the first case (`position < 0`) for simplicity. We set:
- `text = "udbs lx"` (output + 'x')
- `position = -1`

Verification:
- `length = len("udbs lx") = 7`
- `index = -1 % 8 = 7` (but `position < 0` so `index = -1`)
- Remove last character: "udbs lx" → "udbs l" (matches output)

Thus, the input is `text="udbs lx"` and `position=-1`.
