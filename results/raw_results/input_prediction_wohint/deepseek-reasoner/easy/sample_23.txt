[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text, chars)` processes the input text by stripping trailing characters based on the chars argument. The output is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.", which does not have trailing spaces or other characters. 

To achieve this output:
1. If `chars` is non-empty, `text.rstrip(chars)` removes all trailing characters in `chars` from the right end of `text`.
2. If `chars` is empty, `text.rstrip(' ')` removes trailing spaces.
3. If the result is an empty string, it returns '-'; otherwise, it returns the stripped text.

The output string ends with a period and contains internal spaces but no trailing spaces. To produce this output:
- The input `text` must start with "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2." and may have trailing characters that are stripped.
- If `chars` is non-empty, it must not include '.' (to preserve the period at the end) but may include other characters (like spaces) to strip trailing occurrences.
- If `chars` is empty, only trailing spaces are stripped.

The simplest input is when `text` exactly matches the output, and `chars` is empty. In this case:
- `chars` is empty, so trailing spaces are stripped (but there are none), leaving `text` unchanged.
- The function returns the original text, which matches the output.

Thus, the input values are:
- `text`: "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."
- `chars`: "" (empty string)

This satisfies the function's logic and produces the given output.
