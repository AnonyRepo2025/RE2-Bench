[THOUGHT]
The method `remove_employee` returns `False` when the given `employee_id` is not found in the `self.employees` dictionary. The output provided is `false`, indicating the employee ID was not present. 

To satisfy this:
1. The `self.employees` dictionary must not contain the provided `employee_id`.
2. Since the state of `self.employees` isn't specified, we assume the simplest case: an empty dictionary. This ensures any `employee_id` will be absent.
3. We choose an arbitrary `employee_id` value (e.g., `100`) that is not in the dictionary.

Simulation:
- `self.employees = {}` (empty)
- Call `remove_employee(100)`
- Check: `100 in self.employees?` â†’ `False`
- Return `False` (matches output)

Thus, the input uses an empty `employees` dictionary and an `employee_id` of `100`.
