The function `f` modifies the input `text` by:
1. Setting global `field` to `text` with spaces removed (not used in output)
2. Setting global `g` to `text` with '0's replaced by spaces (not used in output)
3. Replacing all '1's in `text` with 'i's and returning this modified string.

Given the output: `"00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0i 0ii0iii0"`

This output is the result of replacing every '1' in the input with 'i'. To reverse this:
- The output contains '0's and 'i's (and spaces). 
- '0's and spaces in the output must match the input exactly since they aren't modified by the '1'→'i' replacement.
- Each 'i' in the output could come from either a '1' or an 'i' in the input. However, the simplest solution is to assume all 'i's in the output came from '1's in the input (since the output has no actual '1's).

Thus, replacing every 'i' in the output with '1' gives the input:
- `"00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110"`

Verification:
- Input: `"00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110"`
- Replace '1'→'i': `"00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0i 0ii0iii0"` (matches output)

The globals `field` and `g` are modified but not part of the output, so they don't affect the solution.
