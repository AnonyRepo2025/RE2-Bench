[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` works as follows:
1. It finds the index of the first occurrence of '8' in `text` using `text.find('8')`
2. Converts the result to an integer (though it's already an integer)
3. Returns the string 'x0' repeated that many times

Given output: "x0x0"  
- This is equivalent to 'x0' repeated twice, so `n` must be 2  
- Therefore, `text.find('8')` must return 2  

Implications for input string `text`:
- Must contain '8' at index position 2 (0-based indexing)
- Characters at indices 0 and 1 must not be '8' (so first '8' is at index 2)
- Minimum valid string: 3 characters long with pattern `??8` (where `?` is any non-'8' character)

Example valid inputs:  
- "aa8" → finds '8' at index 2 → n=2 → returns "x0x0"  
- "128" → finds '8' at index 2 → same result  
- "  8" → (space-space-8) also works  

Chosen minimal input: "aa8" (simple and meets all conditions)
