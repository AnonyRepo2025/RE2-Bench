[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer `n`, then initializes `i = 1` and `j = n * n`. It enters a loop that prints `i` and `j`, increments `i`, and decrements `j` until `i < j` is no longer true.

The output consists of 50 lines. The first number in each line increases from 1 to 50, and the second number decreases from 100 to 51. This indicates:
- The last printed line is "50 51", meaning at the start of the 50th iteration, `i = 50` and `j = 51`.
- After printing, `i` becomes 51 and `j` becomes 50, so `i < j` (51 < 50) is false, terminating the loop.

The relationship between iterations and values is:
- At the start of iteration `k` (1-based), `i = k` and `j = n² - (k - 1)`.
- For the 50th iteration: `j = n² - 49 = 51`.
- Solving: `n² = 51 + 49 = 100` → `n = 10` (since `n` is positive).

Verification with `n = 10`:
- `j = 10 * 10 = 100`.
- Iteration 1: prints "1 100", updates to `i=2`, `j=99`.
- ...
- Iteration 50: prints "50 51" (since `100 - 49 = 51`), updates to `i=51`, `j=50`, then exits.
- Output has 50 lines, matching the given output.

Thus, the input is the integer `10`, provided as a string.
