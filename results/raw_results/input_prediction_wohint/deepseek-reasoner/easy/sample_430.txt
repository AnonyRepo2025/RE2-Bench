[THOUGHT]
The function `f(arr1, arr2)` creates a copy of `arr1`, extends it with `arr2`, and returns the concatenated list. The output is `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`, which is the result of `arr1 + arr2`. Since the output has 9 elements, I need to split it into two lists: one for `arr1` and one for `arr2`. The split can occur at any point, as long as the combined elements match the output. 

I'll choose a split where `arr1` contains the first 5 elements `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]` and `arr2` contains the remaining 4 elements `["", 0, -1, []]`. This satisfies the output when `arr1` is extended by `arr2`. 

Thus, the input arguments are:
- `arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8]`
- `arr2 = ["", 0, -1, []]`
