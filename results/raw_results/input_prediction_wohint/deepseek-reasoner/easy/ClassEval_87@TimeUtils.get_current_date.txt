The function `get_current_date` is a method of the `TimeUtils` class. It returns the current date in the format '%Y-%m-%d' by formatting the `self.datetime` attribute. The `__init__` method initializes `self.datetime` to the current datetime when the object is created. 

Given the output "2025-08-25", this means that at the time `get_current_date` was called, the `self.datetime` attribute must represent August 25, 2025. Since the method takes no arguments (other than `self`), the input to the function call is solely determined by the state of the object. 

The state requires `self.datetime` to be a datetime object corresponding to 2025-08-25. In JSON representation, we can express this as an ISO 8601 string ("2025-08-25T00:00:00") to capture the date. The `args` and `kwargs` are empty since the method has no parameters.

Thus, the input includes:
- `self`: An object with `datetime` set to "2025-08-25T00:00:00".
- `args`: An empty dictionary (no positional arguments).
- `kwargs`: An empty dictionary (no keyword arguments).
