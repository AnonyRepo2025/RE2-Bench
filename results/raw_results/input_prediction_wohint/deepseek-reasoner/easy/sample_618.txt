The function `f(match, fill, n)` returns `fill[:n] + match`. Given the output is "89", we need to find values for `match`, `fill`, and `n` such that this operation produces "89".

Possible approaches:
1. **Decompose "89" into two parts**: `fill[:n]` and `match` must concatenate to "89".
2. **Consider simple cases**:
   - If `fill[:n]` is "8" and `match` is "9", then "8" + "9" = "89". This requires `fill` to start with "8" and `n=1` (since `fill[:1]` takes the first character).
   - If `fill[:n]` is empty and `match` is "89", then `n=0` (since `fill[:0]` is an empty string) and `match="89"` works for any `fill`.
   - If `fill[:n]` is "89" and `match` is empty, then `n=2` and `fill` must start with "89".

The simplest solution uses:
- `match = "9"`
- `fill = "8"` (any string starting with "8" works, but "8" is minimal)
- `n = 1` (so `fill[:1] = "8"`)

Verification:
- `fill[:n] = "8"[:1] = "8"`
- `"8" + "9" = "89"`, which matches the output.

Thus, the input values are `match="9"`, `fill="8"`, and `n=1`.
