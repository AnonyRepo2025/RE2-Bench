[THOUGHT]
The function `f` counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring `part` in the string `full` by sequentially removing each found occurrence and the preceding portion of the string. Given the output is 2, the function must have found `part` exactly twice during its execution.

To achieve this:
1. The first occurrence of `part` is found at some index in `full`.
2. The string `full` is then updated to the substring starting after this occurrence (i.e., `full = full[index + length:]`).
3. The search repeats in the new substring, and a second occurrence must be found.
4. After the second occurrence, no further occurrences are found, so the loop exits and returns 2.

A simple input that satisfies this is `full = "aa"` and `part = "a"`:
- First occurrence: `"aa".find("a")` returns 0. After removal, `full` becomes `"a"`.
- Second occurrence: `"a".find("a")` returns 0. After removal, `full` becomes `""`.
- No third occurrence: `"".find("a")` returns -1, so the count is 2.

Thus, the input `full="aa", part="a"` produces the output 2.
