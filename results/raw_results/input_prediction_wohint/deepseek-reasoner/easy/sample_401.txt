The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `suffix`. It returns `text` with `suffix` removed if `suffix` is non-empty and `text` ends with `suffix`; otherwise, it returns `text` unchanged. The output is "mathematics", which could occur in two scenarios:

1. The input `text` was "mathematics", and `suffix` was either empty or not a suffix of "mathematics", so the function returned `text` unchanged.
2. The input `text` was "mathematics" concatenated with some non-empty string `S`, and `suffix` was `S`, so the function removed `S` to return "mathematics".

The simplest input that produces the output is when `text` is "mathematics" and `suffix` is an empty string. This satisfies the condition:
- `suffix` is empty → the `if` condition fails → `text` is returned unchanged as "mathematics".

Alternative inputs like `text="mathematicsx", suffix="x"` would also work but are less minimal. The empty `suffix` is chosen for simplicity and minimalism, aligning with the example approach.

Thus, the input is:
- `text`: "mathematics"
- `suffix`: ""
