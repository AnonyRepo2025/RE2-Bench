[THOUGHT]
The `list_employees` method returns a dictionary where each key is an employee ID (as a string), and the value is a dictionary containing employee details. The output shows:
- Key "1" with a dictionary containing:
  - "employee_ID": 1 (integer)
  - "name": "John"
  - "position": "Manager"
  - "department": "Sales"
  - "salary": 100000

The method constructs this output by:
1. Iterating over `self.employees` (a dictionary mapping employee IDs to employee info dictionaries).
2. For each employee, creating a new dictionary (`employee_details`) and adding:
   - `'employee_ID'` set to the employee ID from the key.
   - All key-value pairs from the employee info dictionary (overwriting `'employee_ID'` if present).

To produce the output:
- The outer key is "1" (string), so `self.employees` must have a key "1".
- The inner `'employee_ID'` is 1 (integer), meaning the employee info dictionary for key "1" must contain `"employee_ID": 1` (which overwrites the initially set string value).
- The other fields ("name", "position", etc.) come directly from the employee info dictionary.

Thus, `self.employees` must be:
```json
{
  "1": {
    "employee_ID": 1,
    "name": "John",
    "position": "Manager",
    "department": "Sales",
    "salary": 100000
  }
}
```

Since `list_employees` takes no arguments beyond `self`, the input is solely the state of `self.employees`.
