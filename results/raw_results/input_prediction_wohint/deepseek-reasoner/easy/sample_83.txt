[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` processes the input string `text` by:
1. Using `text.rpartition('0')` to split the string at the last occurrence of '0'. This returns a tuple `(head, separator, tail)`.
2. If `tail` is empty (i.e., no characters after the last '0'), it returns '-1:-1'.
3. Otherwise, it returns a string formatted as `len(head):(tail.find('0') + 1)`.

Given the output "2:0":
- The first part "2" means `len(head) = 2`, so the substring before the last '0' must be exactly 2 characters long.
- The second part "0" means `tail.find('0') + 1 = 0`, implying `tail.find('0') = -1` (i.e., '0' is not found in `tail`).

Therefore, the input string must:
- Have a last '0' at position 2 (0-indexed), making the head substring the first 2 characters.
- Have a non-empty tail after this '0' with no '0' in it.
- Be at least 4 characters long (to have a 2-character head, the '0', and at least one character in the tail).

Example: "ab0c" satisfies:
- `rpartition('0')` yields `('ab', '0', 'c')`.
- `len('ab') = 2`.
- `'c'.find('0') = -1`, so `-1 + 1 = 0`.
- Output is "2:0".

Thus, any string with the pattern `XX0Y` (where `XX` is any 2 characters and `Y` is a non-empty string without '0') will work. "ab0c" is a valid example.
