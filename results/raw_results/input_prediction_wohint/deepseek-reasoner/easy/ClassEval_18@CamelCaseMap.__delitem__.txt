[THOUGHT]
The `__delitem__` method in the `CamelCaseMap` class deletes an item from the internal `_data` dictionary using a converted key. The output is `null` (i.e., `None`), which is the expected return value for a successful deletion (no exception raised). For the deletion to succeed, the key (after conversion) must exist in `self._data`. 

The `_convert_key` method processes the input key:
- If the key is a string, it converts it to camel case using `_to_camel_case` (not defined in the snippet). For prediction, assume a standard camel case conversion (e.g., "foo_bar" becomes "fooBar").
- Non-string keys are used as-is.

Since the output `null` does not constrain the key value (as any successful deletion returns `None`), the key must be one that exists in `self._data` after conversion. Without knowing the exact state of `self._data`, we assume:
1. `self._data` contains a key "example" (converted or as-is).
2. The input key is "example", which is a string. After conversion, it becomes "example" (if no underscores exist, it remains unchanged).
3. Deletion succeeds, returning `None`.

Thus, the input key is `"example"`, and `self._data` must contain `"example"` for the operation to succeed.
