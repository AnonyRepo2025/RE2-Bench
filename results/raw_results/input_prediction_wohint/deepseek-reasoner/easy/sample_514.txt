To determine the input that produces the output "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.", we need to simulate the function `f(text)` step by step. The function processes the input string by splitting it into words, then iteratively replacing hyphens attached to each word with spaces, and finally stripping any leading or trailing hyphens.

### Analysis of the Function:
1. **Splitting the Text**: The input string is split into words using `text.split()`, which splits on whitespace and removes leading/trailing spaces.
2. **Replacing Hyphens**: For each word in the split list:
   - Replace every occurrence of `-{word}` with a space.
   - Replace every occurrence of `{word}-` with a space.
3. **Stripping Hyphens**: After processing all words, any leading or trailing hyphens are removed using `strip('-')`.

### Given Output:
The output is `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."`, which contains:
- A hyphenated section `"stew---corn-and-beans-in"` (with no spaces).
- A space separating `"in"` and `"soup-."`.

### Reverse-Engineering the Input:
- **Space in Output**: The space between `"in"` and `"soup"` in the output must result from replacing a hyphen attached to the word `"in"` or `"soup"` during processing. This means the input must have contained a hyphen between `"in"` and `"soup"` (e.g., `"in-soup"`), and either `"in"` or `"soup"` must have been a separate word in the initial split to trigger the replacement.
- **Hyphenated Section**: The section `"stew---corn-and-beans-in"` in the output suggests that hyphens between these words were not replaced. This means the words `"corn"`, `"and"`, `"beans"`, and `"in"` were not separate in the initial split; they were part of a larger word (e.g., `"corn-and-beans-in"`), preventing the function from replacing the hyphens between them.
- **Handling "stew---"**: The leading `"stew---"` in the output indicates that `"stew"` was not a separate word in the split. If it were, the function might have replaced `"stew-"` patterns, altering the output. Thus, `"stew---"` must be part of a larger word or segment in the input.

### Step-by-Step Simulation:
1. **Input Structure**: The input must have:
   - A segment like `"stew---corn-and-beans-in"` as a single word (no internal spaces).
   - The word `"soup-."` as a separate word.
   - A hyphen between `"in"` and `"soup"` to be replaced with a space, which requires `"in"` to be a separate word in the initial split.
   
   This suggests the input should be: `"stew---corn-and-beans-in in-soup-."`.

2. **Splitting the Input**: 
   - `text.split()` yields `["stew---corn-and-beans-in", "in-soup-."]`.

3. **Processing Each Word**:
   - For `"stew---corn-and-beans-in"`:
     - Replace `-stew---corn-and-beans-in` (not found).
     - Replace `stew---corn-and-beans-in-` (not found).
     - No changes.
   - For `"in-soup-."`:
     - Replace `-in-soup-.` (not found).
     - Replace `in-soup-. -` (not found).
     - No changes.
   - The string remains `"stew---corn-and-beans-in in-soup-."`.

4. **Stripping Hyphens**: 
   - No leading or trailing hyphens to strip, so the output is `"stew---corn-and-beans-in in-soup-."`, which does not match the desired output due to the space before `"in-soup-."`.

5. **Adjustment for the Space**: 
   - To get the space between `"in"` and `"soup"`, we need the function to replace `"in-"` in `"in-soup"` with `"in "`. This requires `"in"` to be a separate word in the split.
   - Revised input: `"stew---corn-and-beans in-soup-."` (making `"in"` part of `"in-soup-."` doesn't work).
   - Instead, ensure `"in"` is a separate word by adding a space before it: `"stew---corn-and-beans- in-soup-."` (split: `["stew---corn-and-beans-", "in-soup-."]`).
   - Processing:
     - For `"stew---corn-and-beans-"`:
       - Replace `-stew---corn-and-beans-` (not found).
       - Replace `stew---corn-and-beans--` (not found).
     - For `"in-soup-."`:
       - Replace `-in-soup-.` (not found).
       - Replace `in-soup-.-` (not found).
     - Output: `"stew---corn-and-beans- in-soup-."` (still not desired).

6. **Final Insight**: 
   - The space in the output must come from replacing a hyphen attached to `"in"`. If the input has `"beans-in-soup-."`, the function won't replace `"in-"` because `"in"` isn't a separate word.
   - To force `"in"` to be separate, the input needs a space before and after `"in"`, but then the hyphen in `"in-soup"` isn't attached. Instead, use `"beans-in soup-."` in the input, but this doesn't produce the hyphenated section.
   - The solution is to have `"beans-in"` as one segment and `"soup-."` as another, with a space between them in the input. The function will then process `"in"` (as part of `"beans-in"` or separately) and `"soup"` to introduce the space.

After careful simulation, the input that produces the exact output is `"stew---corn-and-beans-in-soup-."` with a space between `"beans"` and `"in"` in the initial split, but this doesn't work. The correct input is `"stew---corn-and-beans in-soup-."` with a space between `"beans"` and `"in-soup-."`, but the function doesn't replace the hyphen in `"in-soup"`.

### Conclusion:
The input must be `"stew--- in-soup-."` to have `"in"` as part of a separate word, but this doesn't yield the output. After thorough analysis, the input that matches the output through the function's processing is:

**Input: `"stew--- in-corn-and-beans-in-soup-."`**

- **Split**: `["stew---", "in-corn-and-beans-in-soup-."]`
- **Processing**:
  - For `"stew---"`: No replacements.
  - For `"in-corn-and-beans-in-soup-."`: 
    - Replace `-in-corn-and-beans-in-soup-.` (not found).
    - Replace `in-corn-and-beans-in-soup-.-` (not found).
- **Output**: `"stew--- in-corn-and-beans-in-soup-."` (doesn't match).

The correct input is `"stew- in- corn- and- beans- in- soup-."` based on the function's behavior, as it is the only way to get the space by processing `"in"` separately, though it doesn't match perfectly. For the given output, the input is:

[INPUT]
{
    "text": "stew- in- corn- and- beans- in- soup-."
}
