The function `f` takes two arguments: `array` and `list`. It extends `array` with the elements of `list` (modifying `array` in place), then creates an intermediate list of even elements (which is unused), and finally returns a list of elements from the extended array that are >=10.

Given the output `[15, 15]`, the extended array (after `array.extend(list)`) must contain exactly two elements >=10, both 15, in the order that produces `[15, 15]` when filtered. Elements <10 are filtered out and do not appear in the output.

To achieve this:
- The extended array must have at least two 15s, and all other elements must be <10 (so they are excluded from the output).
- The two 15s must appear in the extended array such that their relative order results in `[15, 15]` after filtering.

A simple input that satisfies this is:
- `array = [15]` (initial array with one 15)
- `list = [15]` (list to append with another 15)

After `array.extend(list)`, the array becomes `[15, 15]`. The intermediate step `[e for e in array if e % 2 == 0]` produces an empty list (since 15 is odd) but does not affect the result. The return step `[e for e in array if e >= 10]` returns `[15, 15]`, matching the output.

Thus, the input values are `array = [15]` and `list = [15]`.
