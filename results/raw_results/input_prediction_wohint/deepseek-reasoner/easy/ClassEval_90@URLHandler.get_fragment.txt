[THOUGHT]
The `get_fragment` method extracts the fragment part of a URL (the substring after the first '#' character). Given the output "aaa", the URL must contain "#aaa" such that:
1. The '#' character exists in the URL (otherwise it returns None)
2. The substring immediately after '#' is exactly "aaa" (since the method returns all characters after '#' until the end)
3. There should be no characters after "aaa" in the fragment (otherwise the output would be longer than "aaa")

The simplest URL satisfying these conditions is "#aaa". While other URLs like "http://example.com#aaa" would also work, the minimal case "#aaa" is sufficient to produce the output "aaa". The input requires:
- `self.url` set to "#aaa" (to provide the fragment)
- No arguments (`args` and `kwargs` empty) since `get_fragment` takes no parameters beyond `self`
