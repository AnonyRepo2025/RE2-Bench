The output is 0.6666666666666666, which equals 2/3. The function computes the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The MAD formula is:
1. Calculate the mean: \( \text{mean} = \frac{\sum \text{numbers}}{n} \)
2. Sum the absolute deviations: \( \sum |x - \text{mean}| \)
3. Divide by the number of elements: \( \text{MAD} = \frac{\sum |x - \text{mean}|}{n} \)

Given MAD = 2/3, I need a list where:
- The mean is straightforward to compute
- The sum of absolute deviations divided by \( n \) equals 2/3

Testing with small lists:
- For \( n = 2 \): If numbers = [0, 4/3], mean = (0 + 4/3)/2 = 2/3. Absolute deviations: |0 - 2/3| = 2/3, |4/3 - 2/3| = 2/3. Sum = 4/3. MAD = (4/3)/2 = 2/3. Valid, but involves fractions.
- For \( n = 3 \): If numbers = [1, 2, 3], mean = (1+2+3)/3 = 2. Absolute deviations: |1-2| = 1, |2-2| = 0, |3-2| = 1. Sum = 2. MAD = 2/3. Valid and uses integers.

[1, 2, 3] is simpler and produces the exact output. The function accepts floats, and integers are valid. The input should be passed as the "numbers" argument in "args", with "self" empty (since it's not a class method) and no keyword arguments.
