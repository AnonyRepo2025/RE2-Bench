[THOUGHT]
The task is to predict the input for the `_parallel_fit_estimator` function that would produce the given output. The output shows the state of a `LogisticRegression` estimator after fitting, including hyperparameters and learned attributes like coefficients and intercepts.

Key observations from the output:
1. **Hyperparameters**: The output specifies values like `penalty='l2'`, `solver='warn'`, `C=1.0`, `random_state=123`, etc. These must match the input estimator's configuration.
2. **Learned attributes**: 
   - `classes_ = [0, 1, 2]` indicates 3 classes in the target.
   - `coef_` is a 3x2 matrix, meaning the model has 2 features and 3 classes.
   - `intercept_` is a vector of length 3, consistent with multiclass classification.
   - `n_iter_ = [7]` shows the solver took 7 iterations.
3. **Data requirements**: 
   - Input `X` must be a 2D array with 2 features.
   - Input `y` must contain labels from 3 classes (`[0, 1, 2]`).
   - `sample_weight` is not used (since `class_weight=None` and no sample weights are mentioned).

Reconstructing the input:
- **Estimator**: Must be a `LogisticRegression` instance with hyperparameters matching the output. Attributes like `coef_` and `intercept_` are results of fitting and should not be preset.
- **X**: A 2D array with 2 features. Minimal valid shape is `(3, 2)` (one sample per class), but any data leading to the output is acceptable. Use placeholder values `[[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]]` for structure.
- **y**: A 1D array of labels with values `[0, 1, 2]` to match the classes.
- **sample_weight**: `None` (not used).

The input to `_parallel_fit_estimator` is positional: `(estimator, X, y)`, with optional `sample_weight` as a keyword argument. The estimator is represented by its hyperparameters.
