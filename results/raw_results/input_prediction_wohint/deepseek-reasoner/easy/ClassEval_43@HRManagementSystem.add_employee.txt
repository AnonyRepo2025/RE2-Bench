[THOUGHT]
The `add_employee` method returns `False` when the `employee_id` already exists in the system. The output is `false`, indicating the employee_id provided in the input must be a duplicate. The state of the system (the `employees` dictionary) must contain this employee_id before the call. I'll simulate:

1. The system has an existing employee with ID 1001 (arbitrary choice for duplication).
2. The input to `add_employee` uses this same ID (1001) to trigger the duplicate condition.
3. Other arguments (name, position, etc.) can be any values since they don't affect the output when duplication occurs.

Thus, the input must include an employee_id already present in the system, and I'll represent the system state accordingly.
