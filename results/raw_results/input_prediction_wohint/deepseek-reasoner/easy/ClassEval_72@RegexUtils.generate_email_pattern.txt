[THOUGHT]
The function `generate_email_pattern` is a method of the `RegexUtils` class that takes no arguments (other than the implicit `self`). It returns a fixed regex pattern for email validation. The provided output is identical to the hardcoded return value in the function. Since the method doesn't use any instance attributes or parameters, the input must be a call with an empty `RegexUtils` instance and no arguments.

- **`self`**: Represents an instance of `RegexUtils`. No attributes are needed since the method doesn't access `self`.
- **`args`**: Empty list, as no positional arguments are accepted.
- **`kwargs`**: Empty dictionary, as no keyword arguments are accepted.

The input JSON should reflect a minimal call to the method with an empty instance state and no arguments.
