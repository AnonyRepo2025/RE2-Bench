[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input. The first operation is `nums.clear()`, which removes all elements from the list, making it empty. The subsequent loop `for num in nums:` iterates over the now-empty list, so the loop body `nums.append(num * 2)` is never executed. The function then returns `nums`, which is an empty list `[]`.

Given that the output is always `[]` regardless of the initial content of `nums` (as long as `nums` is a list), the input can be **any list**. However, to satisfy the output requirement and maintain simplicity, the input should be a list. The minimal/simplest input that produces the output `[]` is an empty list `[]`.

Thus, the input for `nums` is `[]`.
