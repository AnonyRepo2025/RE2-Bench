[THOUGHT]
The function `write_excel` writes data to an Excel file and returns 1 on success or 0 on failure. The given output is 1, indicating the operation succeeded. For the function to succeed:
1. `data` must be an iterable of iterables (e.g., list of lists) that can be processed by `sheet.append()`.
2. `file_name` must be a valid string path where the program has write permissions.
3. No exceptions should occur during workbook creation, data appending, file saving, or closing.

Since the output doesn't specify the exact `data` or `file_name`, any valid input that meets these conditions is acceptable. I'll choose:
- `data = [["A", "B", "C"], [1, 2, 3]]` (a simple 2-row spreadsheet)
- `file_name = "output.xlsx"` (a typical valid filename)

The `self` parameter is an instance of `ExcelProcessor` with no attributes (since `__init__` is empty), so it's represented as `{}`. The `args` dictionary contains the function parameters `data` and `file_name`, and `kwargs` is empty.
