[THOUGHT]
The function `add` processes a list by:
1. Iterating over indices starting from 1 (the second element) with a step of 2 (i.e., indices 1, 3, 5, ...).
2. For each of these indices, it checks if the element is even.
3. It sums all such even elements.

The output is 12, meaning the sum of even elements at odd indices (1-indexed) is 12. 

To achieve this:
- The list must have at least 2 elements to include index 1.
- The element at index 1 must be even and contribute to the sum. Other odd indices (if present) may contribute, but are not necessary for the minimal case.
- The simplest input is a list where the element at index 1 is 12 (even), and the element at index 0 is arbitrary (e.g., 0). This gives: `sum([12]) = 12`.

Thus, a valid input is `[0, 12]`.
