To determine the input of the function `f(text)` given the output `"a---c---s"`, we need to simulate the function's execution step by step. The function reverses the input string, processes it in groups of three characters, and constructs the output by joining these groups with '---' separators.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Function Logic**:
   - `ls = text[::-1]`: The input string `text` is reversed and stored in `ls`.
   - `text2 = ''`: Initialize an empty string `text2` to build the result.
   - Loop: `for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3)`:
     - This loop starts at index `len(ls) - 3` and decrements by 3 until it reaches 0 (exclusive).
     - In each iteration, it takes a slice `ls[i:i+3]` (3 characters), joins them with '---', appends the result to `text2`, and adds '---' at the end.
   - `return text2[:-3]`: The trailing '---' is removed before returning.

2. **Given Output**:
   - The output is `"a---c---s"`, which implies:
     - The loop must have run exactly once. If it ran more times, the output would have more groups.
     - After processing, `text2` before trimming would be `"a---c---s---"` (since the trailing '---' is removed to get the final output).

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to run exactly once:
     - The start index `len(ls) - 3` must be greater than 0.
     - The next index (`len(ls) - 3 - 3`) must be ≤ 0 (so the loop doesn't run again).
     - This gives: `0 < len(ls) - 3 ≤ 3` → `3 < len(ls) ≤ 6`.
     - Thus, the reversed string `ls` must have a length of 4, 5, or 6.

4. **Slice Content**:
   - The slice `ls[i:i+3]` (where `i = len(ls) - 3`) must be the characters `['a', 'c', 's']` because:
     - `'---'.join(['a', 'c', 's'])` produces `"a---c---s"`.
   - In the reversed string `ls`:
     - The slice at positions `[len(ls)-3 : len(ls)]` must be `"acs"`.
   - Since `ls` is the reverse of `text`, the original string `text` must end with `"sca"` (because reversing `"sca"` gives `"acs"`).

5. **Valid Inputs**:
   - For `len(ls) = 4`: `text` must be `"scax"` (reversed: `"xacs"` → slice `[1:4] = "acs"`).
   - For `len(ls) = 5`: `text` must be `"scaxx"` (reversed: `"xxacs"` → slice `[2:5] = "acs"`).
   - For `len(ls) = 6`: `text` must be `"scaxxx"` (reversed: `"xxxacs"` → slice `[3:6] = "acs"`).
   - All these inputs produce the output `"a---c---s"` because the loop runs once, processes `"acs"`, and trims the trailing '---'.

6. **Chosen Input**:
   - We select `text = "scax"` (length 4) as a valid input. Verification:
     - `ls = "scax"[::-1] = "xacs"`.
     - Loop: `i = len(ls) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1` (valid since 1 > 0).
     - Slice: `ls[1:4] = "acs"`.
     - `text2 = '---'.join("acs") + '---' = "a---c---s---"`.
     - Return `text2[:-3] = "a---c---s"`.

Thus, the input `text = "scax"` produces the given output.
