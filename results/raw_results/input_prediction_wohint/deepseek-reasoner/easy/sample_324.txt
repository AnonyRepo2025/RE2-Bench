[THOUGHT]
The function `f` returns an empty list only when the output of `desc + asc + desc` is empty. For this to happen:
1. `asc` must be empty after reversal, meaning the original `nums` was empty.
2. `desc` is derived from `asc` (as `asc[:len(asc)//2]`), so if `asc` is empty, `desc` will also be empty.
3. Thus, `desc + asc + desc` reduces to `[] + [] + [] = []`.

If `nums` were non-empty:
- `asc.reverse()` would make `asc` non-empty.
- `desc` would be at least an empty list (if `len(asc)` is 1) or a non-empty sublist.
- The middle `asc` would ensure the output is non-empty.

Therefore, the only input that produces `[]` is an empty `nums` list.
