The function `f` takes an array and a list of values, then performs the following steps:
1. Reverse the input array in-place.
2. For each value in the values list, insert it at the middle index (calculated as `len(array) // 2`) of the current array.
3. Reverse the array again in-place.
4. Return the array.

Given the output `[58, 92, 21]`, we need to find possible inputs for `array` and `values`. The final array after step 3 is `[58, 92, 21]`. Since step 3 reverses the array from step 2, the array after step 2 (before the final reverse) must be the reverse of the output: `[21, 92, 58]`.

Let:
- \( A \) be the initial array (before step 1).
- \( V \) be the list of values to insert.
- \( k = \text{len}(V) \) (number of insertions).
- The length after step 2 is \( \text{len}(A) + k = 3 \), so \( \text{len}(A) = 3 - k \).

We consider possible values of \( k \) (0, 1, 2, 3) and work backwards:

- **Case \( k = 0 \)** (no insertions):
  - \( \text{len}(A) = 3 \).
  - Step 1: Reverse \( A \) → let this be \( B_0 \).
  - Step 2: No insertions → \( B_0 \) remains.
  - Step 3: Reverse \( B_0 \) → output is \( [58, 92, 21] \).
  - After step 3, output is reverse of \( B_0 \), so \( B_0 \) must be the reverse of the output: \( [21, 92, 58] \).
  - Step 1: Reversing \( A \) gives \( B_0 = [21, 92, 58] \), so \( A = \text{reverse}(B_0) = [58, 92, 21] \).
  - \( V = [] \).
  - Simulation: 
    - Start: \( A = [58, 92, 21] \)
    - Step 1: Reverse → \( [21, 92, 58] \)
    - Step 2: No insertions → remains \( [21, 92, 58] \)
    - Step 3: Reverse → \( [58, 92, 21] \) (matches output).

- **Case \( k = 1 \)** (one insertion):
  - \( \text{len}(A) = 2 \).
  - Step 1: Reverse \( A \) → \( B_0 \).
  - Step 2: Insert one value \( v_1 \) at index \( \text{len}(B_0) // 2 = 2 // 2 = 1 \) → \( B_1 = [21, 92, 58] \).
  - Step 3: Reverse \( B_1 \) → \( [58, 92, 21] \).
  - From \( B_1 = [21, 92, 58] \), and insertion at index 1 in \( B_0 \), we deduce \( B_0 \) must be \( [21, 58] \) (inserting \( 92 \) at index 1 gives \( [21, 92, 58] \)).
  - Step 1: Reversing \( A \) gives \( B_0 = [21, 58] \), so \( A = \text{reverse}([21, 58]) = [58, 21] \).
  - \( V = [92] \).
  - Simulation:
    - Start: \( A = [58, 21] \)
    - Step 1: Reverse → \( [21, 58] \)
    - Step 2: Insert \( 92 \) at index 1 → \( [21, 92, 58] \)
    - Step 3: Reverse → \( [58, 92, 21] \) (matches output).

- **Cases \( k = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \)** also yield valid inputs (e.g., \( A = [58] \), \( V = [21, 92] \) or \( A = [] \), \( V = [58, 21, 92] \)), but multiple solutions exist.

The simplest solution (with no insertions, \( V = [] \)) is chosen because it requires minimal computation and aligns with the output being unchanged by the function when no values are inserted. The initial array is the same as the output, and the double reverse cancels out.

Thus, the input is:
- `array = [58, 92, 21]`
- `values = []`
