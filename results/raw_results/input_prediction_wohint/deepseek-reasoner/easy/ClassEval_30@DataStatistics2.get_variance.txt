[THOUGHT]
The function `get_variance` computes the population variance of the data stored in the `DataStatistics2` instance and rounds it to 2 decimal places. The output is 1.25, meaning the variance before rounding must be in the range [1.245, 1.255). 

To find a suitable input, consider that the population variance formula is:
\[
\text{variance} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2
\]
where \(\mu\) is the mean of the data.

A simple dataset that yields exactly 1.25 when rounded is [1, 2, 3, 4]:
- Mean (\(\mu\)) = \((1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 2.5\)
- Squared deviations: \((1-2.5)^2 = 2.25\), \((2-2.5)^2 = 0.25\), \((3-2.5)^2 = 0.25\), \((4-2.5)^2 = 2.25\)
- Sum of squared deviations = \(2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5.0\)
- Variance = \(5.0 / 4 = 1.25\)

This matches the output exactly. The input to `get_variance` requires the instance's `data` attribute to be set to this list during initialization. Since `get_variance` takes no arguments, `args` and `kwargs` are empty.
