The function is defined as:
```python
def f(nums, index):
    return nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2
```
Given the output is 9, we need to find inputs `nums` (a list) and `index` (an integer) such that the function returns 9.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression is `(nums[index] % 42) + (nums.pop(index) * 2)`.
   - Since Python evaluates expressions left-to-right:
     - First, `nums[index]` is evaluated (let's call this value `x`).
     - Then `x % 42` is computed.
     - Next, `nums.pop(index)` is executed, which removes the element at `index` and returns it (which is the same `x` because the element hasn't been removed yet during the left evaluation).
     - Finally, `x * 2` is computed and added to `x % 42`.

2. **Equation Formation**:
   - The expression simplifies to: `(x % 42) + 2x = 9`.
   - Let `r = x % 42`, where `0 ≤ r < 42`.
   - The equation becomes: `2x + r = 9`.

3. **Solving for x**:
   - Express `x` as `x = 42k + r` for some integer `k` (where `k` is the quotient when `x` is divided by 42).
   - Substitute into the equation:  
     `2(42k + r) + r = 9`  
     `84k + 2r + r = 9`  
     `84k + 3r = 9`.
   - Solve for integer solutions:
     - **Case 1: k = 0**  
       `3r = 9` → `r = 3`.  
       Then `x = 42*0 + 3 = 3`.
     - **Case 2: k = -1**  
       `84*(-1) + 3r = 9` → `-84 + 3r = 9` → `3r = 93` → `r = 31`.  
       Then `x = 42*(-1) + 31 = -11`.
     - **Other k values**:  
       `k ≥ 1`: `84k ≥ 84` (too large, since `3r ≥ 0`).  
       `k ≤ -2`: `84k ≤ -168`, and `3r ≤ 123`, so `84k + 3r ≤ -45` (too small).  
       Thus, only solutions are `x = 3` and `x = -11`.

4. **Input Requirements**:
   - The list `nums` must contain either `3` or `-11` at the given `index`.
   - `index` must be valid (i.e., `0 ≤ index < len(nums)`).
   - The rest of the list can be arbitrary, but the simplest case is a single-element list.

5. **Chosen Input**:
   - Use `x = 3` for simplicity.
   - Let `nums = [3]` and `index = 0` (the only valid index for a single-element list).
   - Verification:
     - `nums[0] = 3` → `3 % 42 = 3`.
     - `nums.pop(0)` returns `3` → `3 * 2 = 6`.
     - Sum: `3 + 6 = 9` (matches output).

6. **Input Format**:
   - Follow the example structure: `{"self": {}, "args": {...}, "kwargs": {}}`.
   - Since `f` is a standalone function (not a method), `"self"` is an empty dict.
   - Arguments `nums` and `index` are passed via `"args"` as a dict.
   - No keyword arguments, so `"kwargs"` is empty.

Thus, the input is `{"self": {}, "args": {"nums": [3], "index": 0}, "kwargs": {}}`.
