To determine the input values for the function `f(line, char)` that produce the output "$$78$$", we need to reverse-engineer the function's logic step by step. The function pads the input string `line` with the character `char` in multiple iterations, and we start from the output and work backwards.

### Key Observations:
1. **Output Analysis**: The output is "$$78$$", which is 6 characters long and padded with `$` on both ends.
2. **Character `char`**: Since the padding character in the output is `$`, we deduce that `char` must be `'$'`.
3. **Function Logic**:
   - `count = line.count(char)` counts occurrences of `char` in `line`.
   - The loop runs from `i = count + 1` down to `1` (inclusive).
   - In each iteration, `line` is centered to a new width: `len(line) + i` (since `len(char) = 1`), using `char` for padding.
   - Padding is added symmetrically: `left_pad = i // 2`, `right_pad = i - left_pad`.

### Reverse Process:
We start from the output "$$78$$" and reverse each iteration. The loop ran for `k = count + 1` iterations (where `count` is the initial count of `'$'` in `line`). The total padding added across all iterations is the sum of integers from `1` to `k` (i.e., `k(k + 1)/2`). The final length is `initial_length + total_padding = 6`.

#### Step-by-Step Reversal:
1. **Determine `k` (number of iterations)**:
   - Possible `k` values where `total_padding = k(k + 1)/2 ≤ 6`:
     - `k = 1`: `total_padding = 1` → `initial_length = 5`.
     - `k = 2`: `total_padding = 3` → `initial_length = 3`.
     - `k = 3`: `total_padding = 6` → `initial_length = 0` (invalid, as `count = k - 1 = 2` but empty string has `count = 0` → contradiction).
   - Only `k = 2` is valid (since `k = 1` leads to mismatched padding patterns).

2. **Reverse Iterations** (for `k = 2` → `count = 1`):
   - **Last iteration (`i = 1`)**:
     - Output: `"$$78$$"` (length 6).
     - Padding added: `i = 1` → `left_pad = 0`, `right_pad = 1`.
     - Remove padding: Take substring from index `0` to `-1` (exclude last character) → `"$$78$"`.
   - **Previous iteration (`i = 2`)**:
     - Current string: `"$$78$"` (length 5).
     - Padding added: `i = 2` → `left_pad = 1`, `right_pad = 1`.
     - Remove padding: Take substring from index `1` to `-1` (exclude first and last characters) → `"$78"`.

3. **Initial String**:
   - After reversing both iterations, we get `"$78"`.
   - Verify `count = "$78".count('$') = 1` → matches `count = k - 1 = 1`.

### Verification:
- **Input**: `line = "$78"`, `char = "$"`.
- **Function Execution**:
  - `count = 1`.
  - Loop `i` from `2` to `1`:
    - `i = 2`: `line = "$78".center(3 + 2, '$') = "$78".center(5, '$')` → `"$$78$"` (adds `$` left and right).
    - `i = 1`: `line = "$$78$".center(5 + 1, '$') = "$$78$".center(6, '$')` → `"$$78$$"` (adds `$` right).
- **Output**: `"$$78$$"` (matches).

### Conclusion:
The input values are `line = "$78"` and `char = "$"`.
