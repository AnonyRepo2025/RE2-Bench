[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer input `x`. If `x` is 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 1. The given output is 1, meaning the `else` branch was executed. Therefore, `x` must not be 1. The input must be a string that can be converted to an integer other than 1. Valid inputs include "0", "2", "3", etc. For simplicity, "2" is chosen as a representative input that satisfies the condition and produces the output 1.
