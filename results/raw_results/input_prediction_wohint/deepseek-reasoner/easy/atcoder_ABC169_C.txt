To determine the input that produces the output `0`, we analyze the code step by step:

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads a string and splits it into two tokens using `split()`, which defaults to splitting on whitespace. Thus, the input must contain exactly two tokens, `a` and `b` (as strings).
2. **Transforming `b`**: The second token `b` is transformed by removing its second character (if it exists). Specifically:
   - `b = b[0] + b[2:]` takes the first character and concatenates it with the substring starting from the third character (index 2). This effectively removes the character at index 1.
3. **Conversion to Integers**: Both tokens are converted to integers: `a = int(a)` and `b = int(b)` (after transformation).
4. **Calculation and Output**: The code computes `(a * b) // 100` and prints the result. Given the output is `0`, the product `a * b` must be in the range `[0, 99]` (since integer division by 100 truncates toward zero).

Given the output is `0`, the simplest case is when the product `a * b` is `0`. This occurs if either:
- `a = 0`, regardless of the value of `b` (after transformation), or
- `b = 0` (after transformation), regardless of the value of `a`.

We choose the straightforward case where both `a` and `b` (after transformation) are `0`:
- Set the first token `a` to `"0"`, so `a = 0`.
- Set the second token `b` to `"0"`, so after transformation:
  - `b[0]` is `'0'`.
  - `b[2:]` is empty (since the string `"0"` has length 1, so index 2 is out of bounds).
  - The transformed `b` becomes `"0" + "" = "0"`, which converts to the integer `0`.

Thus, the product is `0 * 0 = 0`, and `0 // 100 = 0`, matching the output.

The input string must be `"0 0"` to produce these tokens.
