[THOUGHT]
The function `read_file_as_json` reads a file specified by `self.file_path` and parses its content as JSON. The output is 12345, which is an integer. This means the file at `self.file_path` must contain the integer `12345` as valid JSON content (without quotes). 

Since the method doesn't take any arguments beyond `self`, the input consists of:
- `self`: An instance of `TextFileProcessor` initialized with a `file_path` pointing to a file containing `12345`.
- `args`: Empty, as there are no positional arguments.
- `kwargs`: Empty, as there are no keyword arguments.

The exact file path isn't specified, but it must be a valid path to a file with the content `12345`. For concreteness, we can use a placeholder path like `data.json`, assuming it contains the required integer.
