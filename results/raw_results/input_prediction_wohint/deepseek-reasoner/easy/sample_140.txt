[THOUGHT]
The function `f(st)` returns "Hey" when the condition is true, else "Hi". The condition involves:
1. Converting the input string to lowercase.
2. Finding the last occurrence of 'i' (`idx_i`).
3. Finding the last occurrence of 'h' starting from `idx_i` (`idx_h`).
4. Checking if `idx_h >= idx_i`.

For "Hey" to be returned:
- The string must contain at least one 'i' (otherwise `.rindex('i')` fails).
- There must be at least one 'h' after the last 'i' (in the substring starting at `idx_i`).
- Since `idx_h` is always ≥ `idx_i` when found, the condition is true if both characters exist in this order.

The output is "Hey", so the input must satisfy:
- Contains 'i' and has an 'h' after the last 'i'.
- Example: "ih" (last 'i' at position 0, 'h' at position 1 ≥ 0 → true → "Hey").

Thus, a valid input is `st = "ih"`.
