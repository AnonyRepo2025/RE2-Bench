Let the input text be `t` and the input `use` be `u`.
The output is `t.replace(u, '')`.
The output is `"Chris requires  ride to the irport on Fridy."`.
Comparing this with a likely original sentence, we can infer that some letters are missing.
"Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday."
`u` could be "a" and `u` could be "a".
Then `t` would be "Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday.".
However, there are two spaces between "requires" and "ride". Also "airport" is misspelled as "irport" and "Friday" is misspelled as "Fridy".
So, let's assume the original text was "Chris requires  a ride to the irport on Fridy.".
Then `u` could be "a".
The output is "Chris requires  ride to the irport on Fridy.".
So, the input text is "Chris requires  a ride to the irport on Fridy." and the input `use` is "a".
