The function returns "Hey" if the last occurrence of 'h' after the last occurrence of 'i' is at or after the last occurrence of 'i'. Otherwise, it returns "Hi".

Since the output is "Hey", the condition `st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i')) >= st.lower().rindex('i')` must be true.

Let's break down the condition:

* `st.lower().rindex('i')`: This finds the index of the last 'i' in the lowercase version of the string `st`.
* `st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i'))`: This finds the index of the last 'h' in the lowercase version of `st`, searching from the position of the last 'i' onwards.

For the condition to be true, the last 'h' must appear at or after the last 'i'.

Example:
* "hi": last 'i' is at index 1, last 'h' is at index 0. The condition is false. Output: "Hi"
* "ih": last 'i' is at index 0, last 'h' is at index 1. The condition is true. Output: "Hey"
* "ihi": last 'i' is at index 2, last 'h' is at index 1. The condition is false. Output: "Hi"
* "hih": last 'i' is at index 1, last 'h' is at index 2. The condition is true. Output: "Hey"
* "chih": last 'i' is at index 2, last 'h' is at index 3. The condition is true. Output: "Hey"

A simple example that satisfies the condition is "ih".
