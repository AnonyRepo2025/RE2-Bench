Let the input be "A B".
A and B are split and assigned to a and b respectively.
The second character of b is removed.
a and b are converted to integers.
The result of a * b // 100 is printed.

The output is 0. This means a * b // 100 = 0.
Since integer division is used, a * b must be less than 100.

Let's consider some cases:
If a = 0, then any value of b will result in 0. For example, "0 123" will give 0.
If b is a single digit number after removing the second character, then b will be a single digit number.
If a is a single digit number and b is a single digit number, then a * b < 100.
For example, "9 9" -> a=9, b=9 -> 9 * 9 // 100 = 0.
If a is a two-digit number and b becomes a single digit number, then a * b can be greater than or equal to 100.
For example, "10 10" -> a=10, b=1 -> 10 * 1 // 100 = 0.
"99 12" -> a=99, b=12 -> 99 * 1 // 100 = 0.

So, a simple case would be "0 123".
