The `set_target_temperature` method simply updates the `target_temperature` attribute of the `Thermostat` object. The method does not return any value, hence the output is `null`. The input will consist of the `self` which represents the `Thermostat` object and the `temperature` argument which is the new target temperature to be set.  Since the output is `null`, we don't have any information about the initial state of the Thermostat or the specific value assigned to the `target_temperature`. Let's assume an arbitrary value for the new `target_temperature`, say 25.
