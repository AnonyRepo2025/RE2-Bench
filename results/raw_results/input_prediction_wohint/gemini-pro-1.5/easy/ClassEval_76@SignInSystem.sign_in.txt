The `sign_in` method returns `True` if the given `username` exists in the `self.users` dictionary and sets the value associated with that username to `True`.  Since the output is `true`, it means the username must have already existed in the `self.users` dictionary. The initial state of `self.users` could be anything as long as it contains the given username.
