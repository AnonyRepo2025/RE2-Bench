Let's reverse engineer the function `f(text, res)` given the output "3Leap and the net will appear".

The function replaces '*', '\n', and '"' with '!' + str(res).  If the resulting string starts with '!', it removes the initial str(res). The output is "3Leap and the net will appear".

Since the output doesn't start with a '!', we know the original string didn't start with '*', '\n', or '"'.  Let's assume `res = 3`.  Then the replacement string is "!3".

The output string doesn't contain any "!3", so the input string couldn't have contained any '*', '\n', or '"'. Therefore, the input string must be identical to the output string.
