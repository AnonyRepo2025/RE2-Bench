Let the input be `number`, `need`, and `remaining`.
The output is `[number + need, remaining - need]` if `need <= remaining` and `[number + remaining, 0]` otherwise.

The given output is `[12, 1]`.

Case 1: `need <= remaining`
`number + need = 12`
`remaining - need = 1`
Adding the two equations, we get `number + remaining = 13`.
Let's try some values for `remaining` and `need`.
If `remaining = 2`, `need = 1`, then `number = 11`.
If `remaining = 5`, `need = 4`, then `number = 8`.

Case 2: `need > remaining`
`number + remaining = 12`
`0 = 1` which is a contradiction. So this case is not possible.

Therefore, we must have `need <= remaining`.
One possible solution is `number = 11`, `need = 1`, `remaining = 2`.
