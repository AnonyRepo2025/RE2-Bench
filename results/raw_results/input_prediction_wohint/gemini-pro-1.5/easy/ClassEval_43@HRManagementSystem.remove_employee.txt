The `remove_employee` method returns `False` if the employee ID is not found in the `self.employees` dictionary.  Therefore, the input must contain an employee ID that does not exist in the system. Since we don't know what the initial state of `self.employees` is, we can assume it's empty or contains some other IDs.  Let's assume it's empty for simplicity.  Any ID that's not already a key in `self.employees` will work.
