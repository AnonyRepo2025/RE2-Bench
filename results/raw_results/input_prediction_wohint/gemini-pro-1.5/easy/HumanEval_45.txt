The function `triangle_area(a, h)` calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `a * h / 2.0`.  We are given that the output is 40.0.  Therefore, we need to find values for `a` and `h` such that `a * h / 2.0 = 40.0`.  This simplifies to `a * h = 80.0`. There are many possible solutions, such as a=10, h=8 or a=8, h=10 or a=16, h=5, etc.  I'll choose a=10 and h=8.
