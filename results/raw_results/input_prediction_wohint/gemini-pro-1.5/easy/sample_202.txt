The function `f` takes an array and a list as input, extends the array with the list, filters out elements based on evenness (which doesn't affect the array), and then returns a new list containing elements from the extended array that are greater than or equal to 10.

The output is `[15, 15]`. This means the extended array must have contained at least two 15s after the extension, and any other elements must have been less than 10.

Let's assume `array` is initially empty, i.e., `array = []`. Then `list` must be `[15, 15]` or a list containing 15, 15, and other numbers less than 10.

Another possibility is that `array` initially contains one 15, and `list` contains another 15 and possibly other numbers less than 10.

Let's choose the simplest input: `array = []` and `list = [15, 15]`.
