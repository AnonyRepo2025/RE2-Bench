The code takes an integer n as input. It initializes two variables i and j to 1 and n*n respectively. The while loop continues as long as i is less than j. In each iteration, it prints the values of i and j, increments i by 1, and decrements j by 1.

From the output, we can see that the last pair printed is (50, 51). This means the loop terminated when i became 51 and j became 50. Since the loop condition is i < j, the loop terminates just before i becomes greater than or equal to j.

We know that j starts at n*n and decreases by 1 in each iteration. Similarly, i starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration. The loop terminates when i is about to become greater than or equal to j. This happens approximately when i and j meet in the middle.

Since the last values of i and j are 50 and 51 respectively, we can deduce that n*n is slightly greater than 50 + 51 = 100.  Specifically, n*n = 100, so n = 10.
