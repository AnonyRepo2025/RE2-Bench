The function `f` first converts the input string to title case (capitalizes the first letter of each word) and then removes all spaces. The output is "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm". To reverse this process, we need to add spaces before each capital letter (excluding the first character if it's a capital letter) and then convert the resulting string to lowercase.

"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm" -> "1 Oe Err Bzz Bmm" -> "1 oe err bzz bmm"
