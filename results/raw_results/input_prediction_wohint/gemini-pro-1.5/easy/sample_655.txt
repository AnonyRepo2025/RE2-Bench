The function `f(s)` removes all occurrences of 'a' and 'r' from the input string `s`. The output is "p".  Therefore, the input string must have contained "p" and potentially some 'a's and 'r's. Since only "p" remains, any combination of 'a's and 'r's around "p" would produce the same output.  A few examples are "p", "ap", "rp", "arp", "par", "rapar", etc.  Let's choose the simplest one: "p".
