Let's analyze the function `f(s, l)` and its behavior with the given output.

The function `f(s, l)` left-justifies the string `s` to length `l` using `=` as padding, and then removes the rightmost occurrence of `=`.

The output is "urecord". This means the original string `s` must have been "urecord" and the length `l` must have been greater than or equal to the length of "urecord" (which is 7). If `l` was exactly 7, no padding would have been added, and the output would be "urecord". If `l` was greater than 7, padding would have been added, but then removed by `rpartition('=')[0]`.

Therefore, a valid input would be `s = "urecord"` and `l = 7` (or any value greater than or equal to 7). Let's choose `l = 7` for simplicity.
