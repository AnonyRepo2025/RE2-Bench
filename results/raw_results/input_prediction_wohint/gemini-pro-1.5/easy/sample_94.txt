The function `f(a, b)` merges two dictionaries `a` and `b`. The output is `{"w": 3, "wi": 10}`.  There are several possible inputs that could produce this output. One example is where `a` contains `"w": 3` and `b` contains `"wi": 10`. Another example would be the reverse. A third example would be `a` containing both key-value pairs and `b` being empty.

I'll choose the first example.
