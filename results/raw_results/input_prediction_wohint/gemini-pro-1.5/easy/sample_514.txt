Let's trace the execution of the function `f(text)` with the goal of determining the original input `text` that produces the output "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.".

The function iterates through the words in the input text and removes any occurrences of the word prefixed with a hyphen.

The output string is "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.".  Let's analyze the potential words that might have been removed.

1. "stew" is present in the output, so "-stew" wasn't removed.
2. "corn" is present, so "-corn" wasn't removed. However, there are three hyphens before "corn", suggesting that perhaps words were removed before "corn".
3. "and" is present, so "-and" wasn't removed.
4. "beans" is present, so "-beans" wasn't removed.
5. "in" is present, so "-in" wasn't removed.
6. "soup" is present, so "-soup" wasn't removed.

The key observation is the three hyphens before "corn". This suggests that three words were removed. Let's assume these words were "word1", "word2", and "word3". The original text might have looked like:

"-word1-word2-word3-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."

The function would have first removed "-word1", then "-word2", and finally "-word3".  Since these removals happen sequentially, the order matters.

Let's consider a simplified example:

Input: "-a-b-c"
Output: ""

The function would first remove "-a", resulting in "-b-c". Then it would remove "-b", resulting in "-c". Finally, it would remove "-c", resulting in "".

Applying this logic to our problem, let's assume the three words before "stew" were "a", "b", and "c". The original input would be:

"-a-b-c-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."

After removing "-a", we get "-b-c-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."
After removing "-b", we get "-c-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."
After removing "-c", we get "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."

This doesn't match the output.  However, if the hyphens were part of the words, the logic changes.

Let's try an input like this:

"---stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."

No words would be removed because there are no words prefixed with a single hyphen. The final output would be "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.".

Therefore, the input must be "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-." itself.
