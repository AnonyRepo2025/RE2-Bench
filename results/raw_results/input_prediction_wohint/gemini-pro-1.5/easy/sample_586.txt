The function `f` returns the highest index in the string `text` where the character `char` is found.  The output is 2. This means the last occurrence of `char` in `text` is at index 2.

Let's consider a simple example:  If `text` is "abc" and `char` is 'c', then `text.rindex('c')` would return 2.

Another example: If `text` is "abcabc" and `char` is 'c', then `text.rindex('c')` would return 5.

We need to find a string and character where the character's last occurrence is at index 2.  "abca" and 'c' would work.
