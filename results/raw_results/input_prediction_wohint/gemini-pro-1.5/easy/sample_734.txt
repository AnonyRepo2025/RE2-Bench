Let's trace the execution of the function `f(nums)` with the given output `[5, 3, 3, 7]`. The function removes even numbers from the input list `nums` starting from the second to last element and moving backward. Since the output contains only odd numbers, it means all even numbers were removed. Let's try to deduce the original input.

The loop iterates from `len(nums) - 2` down to 0.  Since all numbers in the output are odd, the `nums[i] % 2 == 0` condition will only be met if an even number was present at some index `i` in the original list. When an even number is found, it's removed using `nums.remove(nums[i])`.  This shifts all subsequent elements to the left by one position.

Since the output is `[5, 3, 3, 7]`, let's consider potential even numbers that could have been present and removed.
