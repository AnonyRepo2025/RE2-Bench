The function `truncate_number` returns the fractional part of a floating-point number using the modulo operator.  Given the output is 0.5, we need to find a number `x` such that `x % 1.0 == 0.5`.

There are infinitely many such numbers.  For example:

* 0.5
* 1.5
* 2.5
* -0.5
* -1.5

etc.  Any number of the form `n + 0.5` where `n` is an integer will work.  We can choose the simplest one, 0.5.
