The `get_current_date` method formats the datetime object stored in the `self.datetime` attribute.  The output is "2025-08-25". Therefore, the `self.datetime` attribute must hold a datetime object representing August 25, 2025.  The exact time component doesn't matter since the format string only includes year, month, and day.
