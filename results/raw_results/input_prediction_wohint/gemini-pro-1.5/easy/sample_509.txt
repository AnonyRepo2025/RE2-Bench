The output is "5".

If value >= 0:
The output is str(value).zfill(width).
Since there are no leading zeros, width must be less than or equal to the length of str(value), which is 1.
So, width <= 1.
Also, str(value) = "5", so value = 5.

If value < 0:
The output is '-' + str(-value).zfill(width).
Since the output is "5", this condition is not met.

Therefore, value = 5 and width can be any integer less than or equal to 1. Let's choose width = 1.
