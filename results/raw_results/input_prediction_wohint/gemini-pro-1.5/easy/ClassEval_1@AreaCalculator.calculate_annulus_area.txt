The output is pi, which means the difference of squares of radii is 1. Since the question asks for the input of `calculate_annulus_area`, the `self.radius` in the constructor is irrelevant. We just need to find two radii such that `outer_radius**2 - inner_radius**2 = 1`. One simple solution is `inner_radius = 0` and `outer_radius = 1`.
