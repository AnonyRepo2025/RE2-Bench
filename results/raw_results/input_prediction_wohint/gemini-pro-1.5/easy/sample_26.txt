The function returns "error" if either of these conditions are met:

1. `i.index('.') == len(i) - 1`  (The period is the last character)
2. `i.index('.') == 0` (The period is the first character)

The loop iterates through the space-separated words in `items`.

Therefore, `items` must contain a word that starts or ends with a period.
