The function `f` takes two lists, `arr1` and `arr2`, copies `arr1` to `new_arr`, extends `new_arr` with `arr2`, and returns the extended list. The output is `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.

Let's analyze the output to determine the input lists `arr1` and `arr2`. Since `new_arr` is created by copying `arr1` and then extending it with `arr2`, the output list is a concatenation of `arr1` and `arr2`.

There are multiple possibilities for `arr1` and `arr2` that would result in the given output. One possible combination is:

`arr1 = [5, 1, 3]`
`arr2 = [7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`

Another possible combination is:

`arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7]`
`arr2 = [8, "", 0, -1, []]`

And so on. We can choose any split point in the output list. For simplicity, let's choose the first example.
