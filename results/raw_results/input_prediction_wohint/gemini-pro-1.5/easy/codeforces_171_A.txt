Let the input be "a b".
The output is int(a) + int(reversed(b)).
The output is 1219362194.

Let's assume a = 1219360000, then reversed(b) would be 2194. So b = 4912.
Then the input would be "1219360000 4912".

Let's assume a = 1219362000, then reversed(b) would be 194. So b = 491.
Then the input would be "1219362000 491".

Let's assume a = 1219362100, then reversed(b) would be 94. So b = 49.
Then the input would be "1219362100 49".

Let's assume a = 1219362190, then reversed(b) would be 4. So b = 4.
Then the input would be "1219362190 4".
