The `insert_coin` method adds the given `amount` to the current `balance`. The output is the new balance, which is 6.25.

Let's assume the initial balance was 0. In this case, the input `amount` would be 6.25.

However, the initial balance could be any non-negative value. For example, if the initial balance was 1.25, the input `amount` would be 5.0.

Since we don't have information about the initial balance, we can assume it to be 0 for simplicity.
