The function `f(string, substring)` removes the `substring` from the beginning of the `string` as long as `string` starts with `substring`. The output is an empty string. This means the input string must have been made up entirely of the substring repeated n times.

For example:
- string = "abcabc", substring = "abc" -> output = ""
- string = "abab", substring = "ab" -> output = ""
- string = "aab", substring = "a" -> output = "b"
