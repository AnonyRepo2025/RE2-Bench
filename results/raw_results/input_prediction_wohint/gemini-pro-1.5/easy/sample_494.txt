The function `f(num, l)` pads the string `num` with leading zeros until its length becomes `l`.

The output is "001". This means the final string has length 3.
The original string `num` is "1".
The initial length of `num` is 1.
The target length `l` must be 3.
The function adds '0' until the length of the string becomes 3.

Therefore, `num` is "1" and `l` is 3.
