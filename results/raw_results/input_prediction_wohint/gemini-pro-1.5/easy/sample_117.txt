The function `f` returns -1 if the input list `numbers` does not contain more than one '3'.  If it does contain more than one '3', it returns the index `i` of the first iteration where this condition is met. Since the output is -1, the input list must not have contained more than one '3'. Examples of such lists include `[]`, `['1', '2']`, `['3']`, etc. Let's choose `[]` as an example.
