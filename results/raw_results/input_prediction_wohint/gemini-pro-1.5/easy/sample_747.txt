The function returns `True` if the input string `text` is either '42.42' or contains a '.' surrounded by at least three digits on both sides. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Since the output is `False`, the input cannot be '42.42'. Also, it cannot have a '.' surrounded by at least three digits on both sides.

Let's consider some examples that would return `False`:

- "123": No '.'
- "123.4": Less than three digits after the '.'
- "12.345": Less than three digits before the '.'
- "123.abc": Non-digit characters after the '.'
- "abc.456": Non-digit characters before the '.'
- ".": No digits before or after the '.'
- "12345": No '.'
- "123.456789.123": Two dots

Any of these examples would satisfy the condition for returning `False`. Let's choose "123" as a simple example.
