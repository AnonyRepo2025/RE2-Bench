Let's trace the execution backward.

The final `array.reverse()` reverses the array. So before this reversal, the array was `[21, 92, 58]`.

Before that, the loop inserted elements from `values` into the middle of the array. Let's analyze the insertions:

1. Initial `array` (reversed): Let's call it `arr_rev`.
2. First insertion: `arr_rev.insert(len(arr_rev) // 2, value1)`
3. Second insertion: `arr_rev.insert(len(arr_rev) // 2, value2)`
...

Since the final array (before the last reversal) is `[21, 92, 58]`, and the insertions happen in the middle, we can deduce that `values` must have two elements. Let's denote them as `v1` and `v2`.

The array before the last reversal was `[21, 92, 58]`.  This means the insertions resulted in this order.  Let's reverse the process:

* Before the last reversal: `[21, 92, 58]`
* Remove the middle element (92): `[21, 58]` which is the reversed initial array.
* Reverse this to get the initial array: `[58, 21]`

So, `array` was initially `[58, 21]`.  The `values` were inserted in the middle.  Let's see how this happened:

1. `array.reverse()`: `array` becomes `[21, 58]`
2. First insertion: `array.insert(len(array) // 2, 92)` makes `array` equal to `[21, 92, 58]`
3. `array.reverse()`: `array` becomes `[58, 92, 21]` which is the output.

Therefore, `values = [92]`

So, the initial `array` was `[58, 21]` and `values` was `[92]`.
