The function `f` extends the `array` list by appending the elements of `elem` to it.

The output is `[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]`. Let's analyze how this output could have been produced.

The `extend` method adds *each element* of the iterable `elem` to the `array`.  If `elem` is not an iterable, it raises a `TypeError`.

Let's assume the initial `array` was `a`.

1. `a.extend(elem1)` results in `[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]`.
This means `elem1` must be `[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]` and `a` must be `[]`.

However, if we consider that `array` is modified in place, we can reason backwards.

The final output is `[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]`.
If `elem` was `[2, 1]`, then `array` before the last `extend` call must have been `[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3`.
If `elem` was `3`, then `array` must have been `[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3]`.
If `elem` was `[1, 2, 3]`, then `array` must have been `[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1`.
If `elem` was `1`, then `array` must have been `[1, 2, 3], [1, 2]`.
If `elem` was `[1, 2]`, then `array` must have been `[1, 2, 3]`.
Therefore, the initial `array` must have been `[1, 2, 3]` and `elem` must have been `[1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]`.
