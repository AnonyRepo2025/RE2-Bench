The `__delitem__` method deletes an item from the `_data` dictionary. The output is `null`, which means the method executed successfully. The input should contain the `self` object (an instance of `CamelCaseMap`) and the `key` to be deleted. Since the output is `null`, we don't know what key was deleted, or even if the key existed in the dictionary. We can provide a simple example where a key is deleted. Let's assume the key is "hello_world".
