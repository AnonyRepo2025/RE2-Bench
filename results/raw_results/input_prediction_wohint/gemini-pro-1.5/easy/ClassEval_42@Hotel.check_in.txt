The `check_in` method returns `False` if the room type is not in `booked_rooms` or if the given name is not in the `booked_rooms` for that type. It returns `None` if the room can be checked in.

To get `None` (which becomes `null` in JSON), we need a valid room type, a name that exists within that room type, and a room number that is less than or equal to the number of rooms booked under that name.

Let's create a scenario where a room is successfully checked out.
