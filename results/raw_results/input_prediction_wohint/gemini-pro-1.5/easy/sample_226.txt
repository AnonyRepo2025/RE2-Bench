Let's trace the execution of the function `f(nums)` with the given output `[1, 3, 3]`.

1. **Initial state:** `nums` is some initial list.
2. **Loop 1:** The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `len(nums) - 1`.
3. **Condition:** `nums[i] % 3 == 0`.
4. **Appending:** If the condition is true, `nums.append(nums[i])` is executed.

Let's analyze the output `[1, 3, 3]`.

- The first element is 1. This means the initial list must have had 1 at the beginning.
- The second element is 3. This means the initial list must have had 3. Since 3 is divisible by 3, another 3 is appended to the list.

Therefore, the initial list `nums` must have been `[1, 3]`.

Let's trace the execution with `nums = [1, 3]`:

- **i = 0:** `nums[0] = 1`. `1 % 3 != 0`. No append.
- **i = 1:** `nums[1] = 3`. `3 % 3 == 0`. `nums.append(3)`. `nums` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.

This matches the output.
