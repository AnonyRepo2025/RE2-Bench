The function `f(text, chars)` returns a modified version of the input `text`. If `chars` is not empty, it removes trailing characters specified in `chars` from `text`. Otherwise, it removes trailing spaces. If the resulting `text` is empty, it returns "-".

The output is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.". This means the function didn't return "-", so the stripped `text` was not empty.

Let's assume `chars` was empty. Then the function would remove trailing spaces.  If the output string had trailing spaces, they would have been removed.  So a possible input could be "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. " (with trailing spaces).

Let's assume `chars` was not empty, for example, `chars = "xyz"`.  Then the function would remove any trailing "x", "y", or "z" characters. Since the output doesn't have any of these characters at the end, a possible input could be "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.xyz" or "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.".

Let's choose the simplest input where `chars` is empty and the input string has a single trailing space.
