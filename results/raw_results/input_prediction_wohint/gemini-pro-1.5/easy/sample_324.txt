Let's analyze the function `f(nums)` and its behavior with an empty list as output.

The function takes a list `nums` as input.
1. `asc = nums.copy()`: `asc` becomes a copy of `nums`.
2. `asc.reverse()`: `asc` is reversed in-place.
3. `desc = asc[:len(asc) // 2]`: `desc` becomes a slice of `asc` from the beginning up to the middle index (integer division).
4. The function returns `desc + asc + desc`.

If the output is an empty list `[]`, then the concatenation of `desc`, `asc`, and `desc` must result in an empty list. This implies that `desc` and `asc` must both be empty lists.

Since `desc` is a slice of `asc`, if `asc` is empty, then `desc` will also be empty.  And since `asc` is a reversed copy of `nums`, if `asc` is empty, then `nums` must also be empty.

Therefore, the input `nums` must be an empty list `[]`.
