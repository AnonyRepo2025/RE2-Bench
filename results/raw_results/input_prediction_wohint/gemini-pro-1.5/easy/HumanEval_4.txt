Let `n` be the length of the input list `numbers`.
Let `numbers` be the input list.
Let `mean` be the mean of the numbers in the list.
Let `mad` be the mean absolute deviation.

The function calculates the mean absolute deviation as follows:
```
mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
mad = sum((abs(x - mean) for x in numbers)) / len(numbers)
```

We are given that `mad = 0.6666666666666666` which is approximately `2/3`.

Let's try a simple example with `n = 3`.
Let `numbers = [a, b, c]`.
`mean = (a + b + c) / 3`
`mad = (|a - mean| + |b - mean| + |c - mean|) / 3`

Let's try `numbers = [1, 2, 3]`.
`mean = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2`
`mad = (|1 - 2| + |2 - 2| + |3 - 2|) / 3 = (1 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 2/3`

So, `numbers = [1, 2, 3]` is a valid input.
