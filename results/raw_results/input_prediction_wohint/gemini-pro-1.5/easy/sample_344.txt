The function `f` takes a list and an operation as input. It sorts a copy of the list and applies the operation to the sorted copy. However, it returns the original, unsorted list.  Therefore, the operation has no effect on the returned value.

The output is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`. This must be the original input list. The `operation` argument can be anything.
