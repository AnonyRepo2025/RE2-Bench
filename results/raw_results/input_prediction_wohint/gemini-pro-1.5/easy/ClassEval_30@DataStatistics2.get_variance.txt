Let the input data be `x`.
The variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.
The output is 1.25 (rounded to 2 decimal places).

Let's try a simple example: `data = [1, 2, 3]`
mean = (1+2+3)/3 = 2
variance = ((1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (3-2)^2)/3 = (1+0+1)/3 = 2/3 = 0.67 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Let's try another example: `data = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
mean = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5
variance = ((1-2.5)^2 + (2-2.5)^2 + (3-2.5)^2 + (4-2.5)^2)/4 = (2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25)/4 = 5/4 = 1.25

So, the input data can be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
