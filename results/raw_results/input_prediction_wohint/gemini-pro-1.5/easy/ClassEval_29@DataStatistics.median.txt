Let's consider different scenarios for the input `data` that would result in a median of 5.

* **Scenario 1: Single element list**
If `data` is `[5]`, the sorted list is `[5]` and the median is 5.

* **Scenario 2: Two element list**
If `data` is `[5, 5]`, the sorted list is `[5, 5]`. The median is `(5 + 5) / 2 = 5`.

* **Scenario 3: Three element list**
If `data` is `[4, 5, 6]`, the sorted list is `[4, 5, 6]`. The median is the middle element, which is 5.

* **Scenario 4: Four element list**
If `data` is `[1, 4, 6, 7]`, the sorted list is `[1, 4, 6, 7]`. The median is `(4 + 6) / 2 = 5`.

* **Scenario 5: Five element list**
If `data` is `[1, 2, 5, 6, 7]`, the sorted list is `[1, 2, 5, 6, 7]`. The median is the middle element, which is 5.

I'll choose the simplest scenario, which is a single element list.
