The `extract_file` method returns `True` if the extraction was successful and `False` otherwise. Since the output is `True`, it means the zip file `self.file_name` exists and contains the file specified by the `file_name` argument. The `output_path` argument specifies where the file should be extracted.

For a simple test case, let's assume:
- `self.file_name` is "test.zip"
- `file_name` is "test.txt"
- `output_path` is "." (current directory)

We need to create a "test.zip" file containing a "test.txt" file.
