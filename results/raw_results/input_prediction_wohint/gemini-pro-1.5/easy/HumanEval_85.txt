Let's analyze the function `add(lst)` and the given output 12.

The function calculates the sum of even numbers at odd indices within the input list `lst`.

We need to find a list `lst` such that the sum of its even-valued elements at odd indices equals 12.

Here's one possible approach:

* **Index 1:** We could have an even number at index 1. Let's try 2.
* **Index 3:** We need another even number at index 3. Let's try 10.

So, `lst` could be `[0, 2, 0, 10]`.  The function would calculate `2 + 10 = 12`.

Another example: `lst = [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 10]`. The function would calculate `2 + 2 + 10 = 14`. This doesn't work.

Let's stick with the first example.
