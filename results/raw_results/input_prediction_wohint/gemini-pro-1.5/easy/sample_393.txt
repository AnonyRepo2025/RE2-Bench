Let's reverse engineer the function `f(text)` given the output "a---c---s".

The function reverses the input string `text`, then iterates through it in steps of 3 from the end (excluding the last 3 characters). It joins each group of 3 characters with "---" and appends this to the result `text2`. Finally, it removes the last "---" from `text2`.

The output is "a---c---s".  Since the last "---" is removed, the last step of the loop must have produced "a---c---s---". This means `ls[i:i+3]` must have been `['s', 'c', 'a']` for some `i`.

Since the loop goes backwards in steps of 3, the original string `text` reversed (`ls`) must have started with `['s', 'c', 'a']`.  Therefore, the original string `text` must have ended with `['a', 'c', 's']`.  So, `text` must be "sca".

Let's verify:

1. `ls = text[::-1] = "acs"`
2. The loop starts at `len(ls) - 3 = 0`.
3. `text2 += '---'.join(ls[0:3]) + '---' = '---'.join(['a', 'c', 's']) + '---' = "a---c---s---"`
4. `return text2[:-3] = "a---c---s"`
