The `stop` method returns `True` if there is a current song playing (which it then stops), and `False` otherwise. Since the output is `True`, there must have been a song playing. The input should reflect this by having a non-null `current_song`. The value of `current_song` doesn't matter, as long as it's not `None`. The other attributes (`playlist` and `volume`) are not relevant to the `stop` method's behavior.
