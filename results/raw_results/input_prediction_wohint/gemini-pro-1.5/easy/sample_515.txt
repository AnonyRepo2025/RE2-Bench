The function `f` takes an array, reverses it, and multiplies each element by 2. The output is [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]. To find the input, we need to reverse the operations.

1. Divide each element by 2: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
2. Reverse the array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Therefore, the input array should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
