Let's trace the execution of the function `f(text, chars)` with the given output "zbzquiuqnmfkx".

The function applies the replacement twice. Let's denote the original input text as `original_text` and the input `chars` as `c`.

1. **First iteration:**
   - `extra_chars = c`
   - `text = original_text.replace(c, '')`

2. **Second iteration:**
   - `extra_chars = cc`
   - `text = text.replace(cc, '')` (where `text` is the result from the first iteration)

The final `text` is "zbzquiuqnmfkx". We need to reverse the process to find the original text.

Let's assume `chars` is a single character. If `chars` is "a", then the final text wouldn't contain "a".  Since the output contains various characters, it's likely that `chars` is a longer string.

Let's try working backwards.  If the output is "zbzquiuqnmfkx", and in the last step we replaced `cc` with "", then the input to the second iteration must have contained at least one instance of `cc`.

Let's assume `chars = "z"`.

- **Second iteration (reverse):**
    - `text` before replacement: "zbzquiuqnmfkx" (no "zz", so this assumption is wrong)

Let's assume `chars = "bz"`.

- **Second iteration (reverse):**
    - `text` before replacement: "zbzquiuqnmfkx" (no "bzbz", so this assumption is wrong)

Let's assume `chars = "ab"`.

- **Second iteration (reverse):**
    - `text` before replacement: "zbzquiuqnmfkx" (no "abab", so this assumption is wrong)

Let's assume `chars = "abc"`.

- **Second iteration (reverse):**
    - `text` before replacement: "zbzquiuqnmfkx" (no "abcabc", so this assumption is wrong)

It seems unlikely that `chars` is a long string. Let's try a different approach.

Let's assume `chars = "z"`.

- **Second iteration (reverse):**
    - `text` before replacement: "zbzquiuqnmfkx" (no "zz")
- **First iteration (reverse):**
    - `text` before replacement: "zzbzquiuqnmfkxz"

Let's assume `chars = "bz"`.

- **Second iteration (reverse):**
    - `text` before replacement: "zbzquiuqnmfkx" (no "bzbz")
- **First iteration (reverse):**
    - `text` before replacement: "bzbzbzquiuqnmfkxbz"

Let's try `chars = "x"`.

- **Second iteration (reverse):**
    - `text` before replacement: "zbzquiuqnmfkxx"
- **First iteration (reverse):**
    - `text` before replacement: "zbzquiuqnmfkxxx"

It seems that the input `chars` is "x" and the original text is "zbzquiuqnmfkxxx".
