The function `f` takes a list of dictionaries `commands` and merges them into a single dictionary. The final dictionary is returned.

The output is `{"brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4}`.  We need to find a list of dictionaries that, when merged, produce this output.  There are many possible solutions. One simple solution is a list where each dictionary contains one key-value pair from the output.
