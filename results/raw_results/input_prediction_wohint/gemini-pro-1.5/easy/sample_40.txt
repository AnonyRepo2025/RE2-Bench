The function `f(text)` left-justifies the input `text` and pads it with `#` to the right until the length of the result is `len(text) + 1`.

The output is `"the cow goes moo#"` which has a length of 16. Therefore, the input `text` must have a length of 15.  The output also shows that the padding character is `#`.

Since the output is `"the cow goes moo#"` and the padding is a single `#`, the input must be `"the cow goes moo"`.
