Let's analyze the execution flow and determine the required input for `_parallel_fit_estimator` to produce the given output.

1. **Output Analysis:** The output shows a fitted `LogisticRegression` model with attributes like `coef_`, `intercept_`, `classes_`, and `n_iter_`. This indicates that the `estimator` argument to `_parallel_fit_estimator` is a `LogisticRegression` instance.

2. **`LogisticRegression.fit()`:** The output values are a result of the `fit` method of `LogisticRegression`.  Specifically, the presence of `classes_ = "[0 1 2]"` suggests a multi-class classification problem. The `coef_` shape (3 classes x 2 features) tells us the input `X` has 2 features.

3. **`solver="warn"`:**  The output shows `solver="warn"`.  `_check_solver` converts this to `liblinear` and issues a warning.

4. **`multi_class="warn"`:** Similarly, `multi_class="warn"` is converted to `'ovr'` by `_check_multi_class` because the solver is `liblinear`.

5. **`random_state=123`:** The specific values of `coef_` and `intercept_` are determined by the `random_state`. The output specifies `random_state=123`.

6. **Input `X` and `y`:** We know `X` has 2 features and `y` represents 3 classes (0, 1, and 2).  We need to create sample data that leads to the provided coefficients and intercept after fitting.  Since we don't have the exact logic for coefficient calculation, we'll create a minimal dataset that satisfies the multi-class condition with 3 samples, one for each class.
