To get an output of 0.0, the distance between the hour and minute hands must be 0.  This means the tips of the hands must be at the same location.  Since `a` and `b` are not necessarily equal, this implies that both hands must be pointing straight up, at 12 o'clock.

For the hour hand to be at 12, `theta_h` must be `2.5 * pi`.  This means `(h + m / 60) / 12` must be 0.  Since `h` and `m` are non-negative, this implies `h = 0` and `m = 0`.

For the minute hand to be at 12, `theta_m` must be `2.5 * pi`.  This means `m / 60` must be 0, which implies `m = 0`.

Therefore, the input must be `a b 0 0` where `a` and `b` can be any numbers.  Let's choose `a=3` and `b=2`.
