The function `f` counts the number of whitespace characters and the total number of characters in a given string.

The output is a list containing two elements:
1. The number of whitespace characters (ws): 2
2. The total number of characters (len(text)): 34

Therefore, the input string must have 34 characters, 2 of which are whitespace characters.  The specific non-whitespace characters don't matter.  We can construct an example input string like this:

"This string has 34 characters and 2 spaces."

Let's verify:
- Total characters: 34
- Whitespace characters: 2 (two spaces)
