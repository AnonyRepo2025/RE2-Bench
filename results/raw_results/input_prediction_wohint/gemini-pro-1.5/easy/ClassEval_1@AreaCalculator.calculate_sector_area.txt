The formula for the area of a sector is:
Area = (radius^2 * angle) / 2

We are given the output area as 6.283185307179586. Let's denote this as A.
A = 6.283185307179586

We need to find the radius (r) and angle (θ) such that:
A = (r^2 * θ) / 2

Let's assume the radius is 2.
r = 2

Then the equation becomes:
6.283185307179586 = (2^2 * θ) / 2
6.283185307179586 = 2θ
θ = 6.283185307179586 / 2
θ = 3.141592653589793 (which is approximately pi)

So, if the radius is 2 and the angle is pi radians, the sector area will be approximately 2π.
