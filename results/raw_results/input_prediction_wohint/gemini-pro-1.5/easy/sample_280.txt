The function `f(text)` performs the following replacements:

1. Replaces all occurrences of '1' with 'i' in the input `text`.
2. Replaces all occurrences of '0' with ' ' (space) and stores the result in the global variable `g`.
3. Replaces all occurrences of ' ' (space) with '' (empty string) and stores the result in the global variable `field`.
4. Returns the modified `text` (after step 1).

The output is "00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0i 0ii0iii0".
Let's reverse the process:

The return value is obtained by replacing '1' with 'i'. So, to get the original input, we need to replace 'i' with '1' in the output.
"00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110"
