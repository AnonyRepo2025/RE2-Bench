Let the input data be `data`.
The function calculates the mean by summing all elements in `data` and dividing by the number of elements. The result is rounded to two decimal places.

The output is 4.17. So, we need to find a list of numbers whose mean is 4.17 when rounded to two decimal places.

Let's try a simple example:
If data = [4, 4, 4, 5], the mean is (4+4+4+5)/4 = 17/4 = 4.25. This is not 4.17.

If data = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the mean is (2+3+4+5+6)/5 = 20/5 = 4. This is not 4.17.

If data = [2, 3, 4, 5, 7], the mean is (2+3+4+5+7)/5 = 21/5 = 4.2. This is not 4.17.

If data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], the mean is (1+2+3+4+5+6+7)/7 = 28/7 = 4. This is not 4.17.

Let's try to reverse engineer the calculation:
mean = 4.17
Let n be the number of elements in data.
sum(data) / n = 4.17
sum(data) = 4.17 * n

If n = 6, sum(data) = 4.17 * 6 = 25.02. We can try to find 6 numbers that sum to 25.
For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]. The mean is 25/6 = 4.1666... which rounds to 4.17.

If n = 12, sum(data) = 4.17 * 12 = 50.04. We can try to find 12 numbers that sum to 50.
For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The mean is 50/12 = 4.1666... which rounds to 4.17.

Let's use the first example: data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]
