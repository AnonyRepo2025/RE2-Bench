The `update_product_quantity` method updates the quantity of a product in the inventory. The output is `null`, which means the method doesn't return anything.  We need to provide a `product_id` and a `quantity`. The `product_id` must already exist in the `self.inventory` dictionary, and its corresponding value must be a dictionary containing a 'quantity' key. Let's assume the inventory already has product "A123" with a quantity of 5. If we add 2 to the quantity, the quantity will become 7.
