Let's analyze the function `f(n, m, text)` and its behavior:

1. **Empty Input:** If `text.strip()` is empty, the function returns the original `text`.  Since our output is not empty, we know the input `text` was not empty either.

2. **Character Replacement:** The function splits the input `text` into `head` (first character), `mid` (characters between the first and last), and `tail` (last character). It then replaces all occurrences of character `n` with character `m` in each part and concatenates them.

3. **Reconstructing the Input:**  Let's examine the output "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris". We need to figure out what `n` and `m` were to reverse the replacement process.

Let's assume the original string had 'a' where there are now '1's, and '@' where there are now '2's. Then the original string would be: "@@$z&5H3*aa@#a*ahris".

[INPUT]
```json
{
    "n": "@",
    "m": "2",
    "text": "@@$z&5H3*aa@#a*ahris"
}
