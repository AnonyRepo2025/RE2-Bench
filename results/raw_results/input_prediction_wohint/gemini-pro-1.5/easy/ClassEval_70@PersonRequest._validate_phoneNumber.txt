The function returns `None` if the input `phoneNumber` is empty, not 11 characters long, or contains non-digit characters.  The output is `null`, which corresponds to `None` in Python. Therefore, the input could be any of the following cases:

1. Empty string
2. String with length not equal to 11
3. String containing non-digit characters

Let's choose an empty string as an example.
