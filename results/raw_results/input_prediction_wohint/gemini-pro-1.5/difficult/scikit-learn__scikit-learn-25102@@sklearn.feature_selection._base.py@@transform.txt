1. The output is a sparse matrix in CSC format. This suggests the input `X` is also a sparse matrix, likely in CSR format.
2. The output shape is (2, 5). The `inverse_transform` method handles sparse matrices by converting them to CSC format. It then calls `inverse_transform` recursively on the difference of `indptr`, reshapes the result, and constructs a new CSC matrix.
3. The output `indices`, `indptr`, and `data` represent the structure of the CSC matrix.
4. To obtain the original CSR matrix, we need to reverse the transformation performed by `inverse_transform`.
5. The `transform` method calls `_transform`, which applies the `get_support` mask. If the mask is empty, it returns an empty array. Otherwise, it uses `_safe_indexing` to select columns based on the mask.
6. The `inverse_transform` method reverses this process by creating a zero array and filling the columns corresponding to the support with the values from `X`.
7. The output matrix has 5 columns, meaning the support must have 5 elements.
8. Let's assume the support is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] (all features selected).
9. The input CSR matrix should have shape (2, 5) to match the output shape.
10. The `data`, `indices`, and `indptr` of the input CSR matrix should be such that after applying the `get_support` mask and converting to CSC format, we get the given output.

Let's assume the input CSR matrix has the following structure:

```
data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
indptr = [0, 5, 10]
shape = (2, 5)
```

If we apply the `get_support` mask (assuming all features are selected) and convert this CSR matrix to CSC format, we should get the output CSC matrix.
