Let's trace the execution of `factor_terms` to determine the input that produces "R3 + R4 + 4050".

1. **Output Form:** The output is a sum of three terms: "R3", "R4", and "4050". This suggests the input expression is likely a sum as well.

2. **No Factoring:** The terms "R3" and "R4" appear unchanged, and 4050 is a constant. This indicates that no factoring or simplification occurred within the `factor_terms` function.  This means the `gcd_terms` function likely returned the input expression unchanged. This happens when the terms of the sum have no common factors.

3. **Sympify:** The input is first passed through `sympify`. This converts the input string into a SymPy expression.  Therefore, the input should be a string that, when sympified, creates the expression R3 + R4 + 4050.

4. **No Content Extracted:** The constant `4050` appears as is. This implies that the `as_content_primitive` function returned 1 as the content and the original expression as the primitive part.

Therefore, the most likely input is simply the string "R3 + R4 + 4050".
