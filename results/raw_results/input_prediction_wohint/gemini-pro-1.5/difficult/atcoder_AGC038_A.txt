[THOUGHT]
The output consists of 1000 lines, each containing 1000 characters of either '0' or '1'. The code constructs a 2D array and fills it based on the input values `H`, `W`, `A`, and `B`.

The output shows that for the first `B` rows, the first `A` characters are '0' and the rest are '1'. For the remaining rows (from `B` to `H`), the first `A` characters are '1' and the rest are '0'.

Since the output is a 1000x1000 grid of characters, `H` and `W` must both be 1000. The split occurs at the 500th row and 500th column, meaning `A` and `B` are both 500.
