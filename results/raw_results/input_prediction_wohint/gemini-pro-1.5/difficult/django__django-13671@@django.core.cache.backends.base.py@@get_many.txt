The `get_many` function retrieves multiple values from the cache based on the provided keys. An empty dictionary `{}` as output indicates that none of the requested keys were found in the cache. This can happen in three scenarios:

1. **Empty keys list:** The input `keys` list is empty.
2. **Keys not present:** The provided keys are not present in the cache.
3. **All keys expired:** All the provided keys exist in the cache, but they have all expired.

Since the goal is to predict the simplest input, let's assume the first scenario: an empty keys list.
