[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of the `factor_terms` function with a focus on the `do` sub-function, given the desired output.

The output `(-1 + "sqrt(3)\"*I)*("sqrt(21)\" + 5)**(1/3)` suggests that the input expression likely involves a cube root and complex numbers.  The structure also hints at a factored form.

Here's a possible breakdown:

1. **Outermost Multiplication:** The expression is a product of two terms: `(-1 + "sqrt(3)\"*I)` and `("sqrt(21)\" + 5)**(1/3)`. This suggests the input might be a product as well, or an expression that simplifies to this factored form.

2. **Complex Term:** `(-1 + "sqrt(3)\"*I)` is a complex number. This part might come from a term in the input that involves `I` or a square root of a negative number.

3. **Cube Root Term:** `("sqrt(21)\" + 5)**(1/3)` is a cube root. This strongly suggests the input contains a cube root or an expression with an exponent of 1/3.

4. **No gcd or content extraction:** The output appears to be a direct result of processing the input terms without any gcd or content extraction. This suggests the input terms are relatively prime.

Based on these observations, a potential input could be a product of a complex number and a cube root.  Let's try something like:

`(-1 + sqrt(3)*I) * (5 + sqrt(21))**(1/3)`

This input, when passed to `factor_terms`, would likely be processed as follows:

- The `do` function would encounter the multiplication.
- Each term would be recursively processed by `do`.
- The complex term `(-1 + sqrt(3)*I)` would remain unchanged.
- The cube root term `(5 + sqrt(21))**(1/3)` would also remain unchanged.
- The final output would be the product of these two terms, matching the desired output.
