1. The output contains keys like "remainder__copy", "remainder__with_mean", "remainder__with_std", which suggests that `deep` is True and there's an estimator named "remainder".
2. The output also includes a nested dictionary for "remainder" with keys "with_mean", "with_std", and "copy", matching the values associated with the "remainder__" prefixed keys. This confirms that "remainder" is an estimator with these parameters.
3. The presence of "n_jobs", "transformer_weights", and "transformers" suggests these are parameters of the _BaseComposition object itself.
4. "trans1" is also a parameter of the _BaseComposition object.

Therefore, the input should have `deep=True`, `attr` should be a list containing at least `('remainder', <remainder_estimator>)`, and the _BaseComposition object should have parameters "n_jobs", "transformer_weights", "transformers", and "trans1".
