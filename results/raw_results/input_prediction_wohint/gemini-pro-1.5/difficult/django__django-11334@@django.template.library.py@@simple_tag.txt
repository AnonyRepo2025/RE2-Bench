The output is an empty dictionary `{}`. `simple_tag` returns a decorator function `dec` when called with only keyword arguments.  Since the output is empty, it means the inner function `dec` hasn't been called yet. Therefore, the input should only contain the keyword arguments and optionally `func` as None.
