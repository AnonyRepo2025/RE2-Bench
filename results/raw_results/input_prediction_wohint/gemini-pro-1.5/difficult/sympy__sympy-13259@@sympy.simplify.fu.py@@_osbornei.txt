[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the `_osbornei` function and its behavior to determine the input that produces "2*tanh(x)".

The function iterates through the expression and replaces trigonometric functions with their hyperbolic counterparts based on the following mapping:

- sin(x) -> sinh(x*I)/I
- cos(x) -> cosh(x*I)
- tan(x) -> tanh(x*I)/I
- cot(x) -> coth(x*I)*I
- sec(x) -> sech(x*I)
- csc(x) -> csch(x*I)*I

The output we want is `2*tanh(x)`.  This suggests the input expression likely involves `tan`.  Since the transformation for `tan` involves multiplying the argument by `I` and dividing the result by `I`, we can deduce that the input should be `2*tan(x)`.  The `d` parameter seems to be a dummy variable used for substitution, and it doesn't affect the final result in this case.
