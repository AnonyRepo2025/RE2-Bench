[THOUGHT]
The function `periodicity(f, symbol, check=False)` returns the period of a function `f` with respect to the symbol `symbol`. The output is `2*pi`. This suggests the input function `f` likely involves trigonometric functions like `sin` or `cos`.

Let's consider a simple example: `f = sin(x)`. The period of `sin(x)` is `2*pi`.  Therefore, if `f = sin(x)` and `symbol = x`, the function `periodicity(sin(x), x)` would return `2*pi`.

Other functions with a period of `2*pi` include `cos(x)`, `sec(x)`, and `csc(x)`.  The function could also be a more complex expression involving these functions, as long as the overall period remains `2*pi`. For example, `sin(2*x)` has a period of `pi`, while `sin(x/2)` has a period of `4*pi`.

To keep it simple, let's assume the input function is `sin(x)` and the symbol is `x`.
