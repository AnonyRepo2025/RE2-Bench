Let's analyze the output to determine the input parameters for `make_blobs`.

1. **Number of samples:** The output array `X` has 8 samples (rows).
2. **Number of features:** The output array `X` has 2 features (columns).
3. **Number of centers/clusters:** The output array `y` has values [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. This suggests 2 clusters (0 and 1).
4. **Centers:**  We can estimate the centers by calculating the mean of the samples belonging to each cluster.
   - Cluster 0: (0.87305123, 4.71438583), (1.42013331, 4.63746165), (1.9263585, 4.15243012), (1.12031365, 5.75806083), (1.7373078, 4.42546234) -> Mean ≈ (1.415, 4.938)
   - Cluster 1: (3.54934659, 0.6925054), (-0.49772229, 1.55128226), (2.36833522, 0.04356792) -> Mean ≈ (1.807, 0.762)
5. **Cluster standard deviation:** The spread of the data points around the centers appears relatively small, suggesting a `cluster_std` close to 1.
6. **Shuffle:** The samples in the output appear shuffled, as the labels are not grouped together. This indicates `shuffle=True`.
7. **Random state:** Since we don't have the exact random state used, we'll set it to `None`. This will use the global random state, which may not reproduce the exact output but will generate similar data.

Based on this analysis, we can construct the input.
