Let's analyze the code flow to determine the conditions under which `_eval_is_extended_real` returns `True`.

1. **Real base and exponent:** The simplest case is when both `self.base` and `self.exp` are real.  If the base is positive, the result is always real. If the base is non-negative and the exponent is non-negative, the result is real. If the exponent is an integer and the base is non-zero, the result is real.

2. **Negative real base and rational exponent:** If the base is negative and the exponent is a rational number, the result can be complex (e.g., (-1)^(1/2) = I).

3. **Imaginary base and integer exponent:** If the base is imaginary and the exponent is an even integer, the result is real. If the exponent is an odd integer, the result is imaginary.

4. **Real base and imaginary exponent:** If the base is -1 and the exponent is imaginary, the result is real.

5. **Base is not real:** If the base is not real, the function checks if `arg(self.base) * self.exp / S.Pi` is an integer. If it is, the result is real.

To get a `True` output, we can choose the simplest case: a positive real base and a real exponent. For example, base = 2 and exponent = 3.
