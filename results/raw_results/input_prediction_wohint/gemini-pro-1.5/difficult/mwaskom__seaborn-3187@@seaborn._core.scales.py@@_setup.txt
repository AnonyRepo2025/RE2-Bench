Let's analyze the code and the desired output to determine the input for the `_setup` function.

1. **`values`, `norm`, `trans`, `_tick_params`, `_label_params`**: These attributes in the output seem to directly reflect the input `self` argument, a `ContinuousBase` instance.  The output values for these attributes will be the same as the input values.

2. **`_legend`**: The output shows `_legend` as `null`. This means the `prop.legend` condition in the code was likely false.

3. **`_matplotlib_scale`**: The output shows a `_matplotlib_scale` with a transform. This suggests that `_get_scale` was called. The transform's attributes being empty dictionaries or 1 suggests that the `forward` and `inverse` functions might be simple or identity functions.

4. **`_pipeline`**: The output shows `_pipeline` as `null`. This means `prop.normed` was likely false, skipping the normalization step.

5. **`_spacer`**: The output shows `_spacer` as an empty dictionary `{}`. This is the initial state of `_spacer` before it's assigned a function within `_setup`.

Based on these observations, we can construct the input:
