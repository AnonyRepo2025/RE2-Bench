Let's trace the execution of `replace_named_groups` with different inputs to understand how it works and determine the input that produces the given output.

The function aims to replace named capture groups in a regular expression pattern with just the group name.  For example:

`(P<year>\d{4})` would become `<year>`

Let's try with the expected output:

Input: `admin/password_change/done/`

This input string doesn't contain any named groups. The `named_group_matcher.finditer()` won't find any matches, so `named_group_indices` will be an empty list. The loop following it won't execute, and the function will return the original string unchanged.  Therefore, the input `admin/password_change/done/` will indeed produce the output `admin/password_change/done/`.
