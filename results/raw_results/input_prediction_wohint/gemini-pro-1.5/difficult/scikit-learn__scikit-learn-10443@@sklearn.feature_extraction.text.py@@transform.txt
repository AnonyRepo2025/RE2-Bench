Let's break down how to get the desired output from the `TfidfTransformer.transform` method.

1. **Output Shape (11, 2):** This tells us the input `X` must have 11 rows (documents) and 2 columns (features).  The CSR representation in the output confirms this.

2. **`indices`, `indptr`, `data`:** These define the non-zero elements of the sparse matrix.  Let's visualize the matrix:

   ```
   (0, 1)	0.40796057
   (0, 0)	0.91299955
   (1, 1)	0.66635332
   (1, 0)	0.74563614
   (2, 1)	0.87269566
   (2, 0)	0.48826456
   (3, 0)	1.00000000
   ```

3. **`TfidfTransformer` Parameters:** The output values suggest `use_idf=True`, `smooth_idf=True`, and `norm` is likely 'l2'.  `sublinear_tf` might be `True` or `False`; its effect is less obvious from the output alone.  We'll assume `False` for simplicity, but it's difficult to be certain without more information.

4. **Reconstructing Input `X`:** To get the output matrix, we need to reverse the TF-IDF transformation.  This is tricky because of the IDF multiplication and normalization. However, we can construct an input `X` that, when transformed, *could* produce the given output.  We'll focus on the structure and non-zero positions.

   Since `norm='l2'`, the input values don't directly correspond to the output values after normalization.  We'll use placeholder values (1s) in the non-zero positions and let the transformer handle the calculations.
