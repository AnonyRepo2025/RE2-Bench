Let's analyze the code step by step to determine the input values for `y_true`, `y_pred`, `labels`, `sample_weight`, and `normalize` that would produce the given output.

The output is a confusion matrix:

```
[[20 20]
 [10 50]]
```

This is a 2x2 matrix, meaning there are two classes. The matrix elements represent:

- [0, 0]: True class 0, predicted class 0 (20 samples)
- [0, 1]: True class 0, predicted class 1 (20 samples)
- [1, 0]: True class 1, predicted class 0 (10 samples)
- [1, 1]: True class 1, predicted class 1 (50 samples)

From this, we can deduce the following about the input:

- **y_true and y_pred lengths:** The total number of samples is 20 + 20 + 10 + 50 = 100.  `y_true` and `y_pred` should each have a length of 100.
- **labels:** Since the confusion matrix is 2x2, there are two labels.  We can assume labels to be [0, 1] or any other two distinct values. Let's assume [0, 1] for simplicity.
- **sample_weight:**  Since the counts are integers, we can assume `sample_weight=None`, which defaults to an array of ones.
- **normalize:** The sum of the matrix elements is 100, which is the total number of samples. This indicates that `normalize` is None (not normalized).

Now, let's construct `y_true` and `y_pred` based on the matrix values:

- 20 samples are true 0 and predicted 0.
- 20 samples are true 0 and predicted 1.
- 10 samples are true 1 and predicted 0.
- 50 samples are true 1 and predicted 1.
