Let's analyze the code and its behavior to determine the input that produces the given output.

The `_eval_subs` function attempts to substitute an expression (`old`) with another expression (`new`) within the given expression (`self`).

In this case, the output is "2*x". This suggests that the original expression likely contained `old` and that `new` is `x` or `2*x`.

Here's a breakdown of possible scenarios:

1. **`self` is `2*y`, `old` is `y`, `new` is `x`**: This is the most straightforward scenario. The substitution of `y` with `x` in `2*y` results in `2*x`.

2. **`self` is `y`, `old` is `y`, `new` is `2*x`**:  This scenario also works. Substituting `y` with `2*x` in `y` results in `2*x`.

3. **`self` is `2*old`, `old` is `old`, `new` is `x`**: This scenario also works. Substituting `old` with `x` in `2*old` results in `2*x`.

4. **More complex scenarios**: There could be more complex scenarios involving nested expressions, but let's focus on the simplest ones for now.

Since we're asked to predict *an* input, not all possible inputs, we can choose the simplest scenario (1).

[INPUT]
```json
{
  "self": "2*y",
  "old": "y",
  "new": "x",
  "hints": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]
