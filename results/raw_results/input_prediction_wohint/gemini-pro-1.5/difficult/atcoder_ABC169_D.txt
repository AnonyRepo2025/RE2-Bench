[THOUGHT]
Let the input be x.
The code calculates the prime factorization of x and stores it in l as a list of pairs [prime, exponent].
Then, for each prime factor, it finds the smallest integer j such that 1+2+...+j >= exponent.
The sum of these j's is the output.

The output is 2. This means the sum of j's is 2.
Case 1: j1 = 2. Then the exponent of some prime factor must be at least 1+2 = 3. So x could be 2^3 = 8, or 3^3 = 27, etc.
If x = 8, l = [[2, 3]]. j = 2. ans = 2.
If x = 27, l = [[3, 3]]. j = 2. ans = 2.

Case 2: j1 = 1, j2 = 1. Then the exponents of two prime factors must be at least 1. So x could be 2*3 = 6, 2*5 = 10, 3*5 = 15, etc.
If x = 6, l = [[2, 1], [3, 1]]. j1 = 1, j2 = 1. ans = 1+1 = 2.
If x = 10, l = [[2, 1], [5, 1]]. j1 = 1, j2 = 1. ans = 1+1 = 2.
If x = 15, l = [[3, 1], [5, 1]]. j1 = 1, j2 = 1. ans = 1+1 = 2.

Let's try x = 6.
factorization(6) = [[2, 1], [3, 1]]
l = [[2, 1], [3, 1]]
ans = 0
For i = 0:
    num = 1
    j = 1
    ans += 1
For i = 1:
    num = 1
    j = 1
    ans += 1
ans = 2

Let's try x = 8.
factorization(8) = [[2, 3]]
l = [[2, 3]]
ans = 0
For i = 0:
    num = 3
    j = 1, s = 1
    j = 2, s = 3
    ans += 2
ans = 2

So both 6 and 8 are valid inputs. Let's choose 6.
