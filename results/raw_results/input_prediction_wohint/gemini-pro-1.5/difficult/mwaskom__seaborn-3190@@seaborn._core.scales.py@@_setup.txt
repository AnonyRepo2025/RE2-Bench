Let's analyze the code and the desired output to determine the input for the `_setup` function.

1. **`new._tick_params` and `new._label_params`**: The output shows these are initialized with specific values. The code initializes them to `None` and then updates them if they are still `None`. This means the input `self` must have these attributes set to `None` initially.

2. **`new._legend`**: The output shows this is `null`. The code sets this attribute if `prop.legend` is true. Therefore, in our input, `prop.legend` must be false.

3. **`new._matplotlib_scale`**: The output shows this is initialized with a `_transform` attribute. The code sets this by calling `new._get_scale`. The `_get_scale` method uses `new.trans` to determine the scale. The output `trans` is "log", so the input `self.trans` must be "log".

4. **`new._pipeline`**: The output shows this is `null`. The code sets this attribute. The important part here is the `normalize` function within the pipeline.  If `prop.normed` is true, `normalize` is defined. If it's false, `normalize` is `None`. Since the output `_pipeline` is `null`, we can infer that the input `prop.normed` is likely false. This also aligns with the fact that `norm` is `null` in the output.

5. **`new._spacer`**: The output shows this is an empty dictionary `{}`. The code sets this to a function `spacer`.

6. **`values`, `norm`**: These are `null` in the output, suggesting they are likely `None` in the input.

Based on these observations, the input should be:
