[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and the desired output to determine the input for `_finger`.

The `_finger` function calculates a "fingerprint" of an equation `eq` based on the occurrences of symbols and their logical combinations. The output is a dictionary where keys are tuples representing the counts of different symbol usages, and values are lists of symbols corresponding to those counts.

The desired output is `{(0, 0, 1, 1, 3): null}`. This means there's a single symbol with the following characteristics:

* **0:** Appears as a standalone symbol (e.g., `x`).
* **0:** Appears negated (e.g., `~x`).
* **1:** Appears within a logical operation (but not negated).
* **1:** Appears negated within a logical operation.
* **3:** Total occurrences within logical operations (sum of the previous two plus the number of arguments in the operation).

Let's construct a simple equation that satisfies these conditions.  Consider the equation `x | ~x`.

1. **x:** Appears once inside a logical operation (OR), but not negated.
2. **~x:** Appears once inside a logical operation (OR), negated.
3. **OR operation:** Has two arguments, so the total count is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Oops, we need a total of 3.

Let's try `x & ~x`.

1. **x:** Appears once inside a logical operation (AND), but not negated.
2. **~x:** Appears once inside a logical operation (AND), negated.
3. **AND operation:** Has two arguments, so the total count is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Still not 3.

The last element of the tuple is the sum of the number of arguments in the logical operation plus the number of negations.  We need this to be 3, and we have one symbol appearing both positively and negatively.  This means the operation must have only one other argument.  Let's try `x ^ ~x`.

1. **x:** Appears once inside a logical operation (XOR), but not negated.
2. **~x:** Appears once inside a logical operation (XOR), negated.
3. **XOR operation:** Has two arguments, so the total count is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Still not 3.

Let's try `x | y & ~x`.

1. **x:** Appears once not negated, once negated within an operation.
2. **y:** Appears once not negated within an operation.
3. **|:** Has two arguments, so the total count for x is 1 + 2 = 3.
4. **&:** Has two arguments, so the total count for x is 1 + 2 = 3.

This doesn't match the pattern.

Let's consider `Eq(x, ~x)`.

1. **x:** Appears once not negated, once negated within an operation.
2. **Eq:** Has two arguments, so the total count for x is 1 + 2 = 3.

This seems to fit the pattern.
