1. The output string "LeavePGroupsOut(n_groups=3)" suggests that the class name is "LeavePGroupsOut" and the only parameter is "n_groups" with a value of 3.
2. The `_build_repr` function constructs the representation string by inspecting the `__init__` method's signature and extracting the parameter names. It then retrieves the values of these parameters from the object instance.
3. To get the desired output, the input object `self` must be an instance of a class (or a class itself) named "LeavePGroupsOut" and have an attribute "n_groups" with a value of 3.  It should also not have a 'cvargs' attribute, or if it does, it should not contain the key 'n_groups'. The `__init__` method of this class should accept `n_groups` as an argument.
