[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the `log_loss` function and determine the inputs required to produce an output close to 2.22e-16.

1. **`eps` handling:** The provided code has a `FutureWarning` about the `eps` parameter.  For this exercise, we'll assume it behaves as if `eps` is automatically determined by `np.finfo(y_pred.dtype).eps`.

2. **Label Handling:** The function uses `LabelBinarizer`. If `labels` is not provided, it fits on `y_true`.  If only one class is present in `y_true`, a `ValueError` is raised. To avoid this, we need at least two distinct labels in `y_true`.

3. **Clipping and Normalization:** `y_pred` values are clipped to be within `[eps, 1-eps]`.  Also, if the predictions don't sum to 1 along each row, a warning is issued, and they are normalized to sum to 1.

4. **Loss Calculation:** The core loss is calculated using `-xlogy(transformed_labels, y_pred)`.  To get a near-zero loss, `transformed_labels` and `y_pred` should align very closely.

5. **Simplification:**  Let's assume `sample_weight` is `None` and `normalize` is `True` to simplify the problem.

**Input Construction Strategy:**

To achieve a near-zero log loss, we'll create a scenario where `y_true` and `y_pred` perfectly align after label binarization and clipping.

* **`y_true`:**  Let's use `[0, 1]` to have two distinct classes.
* **`y_pred`:** We'll set `y_pred` to `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. This represents confident predictions for each class.  This will align perfectly with the binarized `y_true`.

This setup should result in a log loss very close to zero due to the `xlogy` calculation.
