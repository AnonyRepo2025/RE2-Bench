Let's trace the execution of `_set_params` given the provided output and the available code.

1. **Initial State:** The output shows the state of the object *after* `_set_params` has been called.  We need to work backward to determine the input `params`.

2. **`_transformers` is null:** This means the line `if attr in params: setattr(self, attr, params.pop(attr))` must have been executed with `attr='_transformers'` and a value of `None` for the `_transformers` key in `params`.

3. **Other parameters:** The output also shows `remainder='drop'`, `n_jobs=2`, and `transformer_weights=None`. These attributes were likely set directly through the `super().set_params(**params)` call. This means these key-value pairs were present in the input `params`.

4. **No nested parameters:** The code iterates through keys in `params` looking for double underscores (`__`) to indicate nested parameters. Since the output doesn't show any modified nested parameters (like `estimator__some_param`), we can assume there were no such nested parameters in the input.

Therefore, the input `params` likely contained the keys '_transformers', 'remainder', 'n_jobs', and 'transformer_weights' with the values reflected in the output.
