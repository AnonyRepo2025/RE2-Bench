Let's trace the execution of `_stringify_py37` to determine the required input for the given output.

The desired output is `"test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\""`.  Looking at the code, the only place this form of output can be generated is in the `else` block at the end:

```python
    else:
        return repr(annotation)
```

This means that none of the earlier conditions were met. Let's analyze them one by one to understand what input would cause this:

1. **`module == 'typing'`:** This condition is skipped because our target output doesn't involve any of the logic within this block.  Therefore, the input `annotation`'s `__module__` attribute should *not* be `'typing'`.

2. **`hasattr(annotation, '__qualname__')`:** This condition is also skipped.  So, the input `annotation` should *not* have a `__qualname__` attribute.

3. **`hasattr(annotation, '__origin__')`:**  This is also skipped. The input `annotation` should *not* have an `__origin__` attribute.

Since none of the above conditions are met, the `else` block is executed, and the output is `repr(annotation)`.  For the output to be `"test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\""`, the `repr()` of the input `annotation` must be exactly this string.  This suggests that the input `annotation` is likely a `ForwardRef` object.

    "annotation": {
        "__module__": "test_util_typing",
        "__forward_arg__": "MyClass2"
