Let's analyze the `urlencode` function and its behavior with different input types to determine the input that produces "a=1&b=2&c=3".

The `urlencode` function handles three main input types:

1. **MultiValueDict:** If the input `query` is a MultiValueDict, it calls `query.lists()`, which essentially returns an iterator over the items (key-value pairs) of the dictionary.

2. **Dictionary-like object:** If `query` has an `items()` method (like a regular dictionary), it calls `query.items()` to get an iterator over the key-value pairs.

3. **Other iterables:** Otherwise, it assumes `query` is an iterable of key-value pairs.

Inside the main loop, the function checks if the value is `None` and raises a `TypeError` if so. It also handles the `doseq` flag, which determines whether to encode multiple values for the same key as a list or not.

In our case, the output is "a=1&b=2&c=3", which is a simple URL-encoded string with three distinct keys and their corresponding values.  Since there are no repeated keys, the `doseq` flag doesn't play a role here.

To produce this output, the input `query` can be any of the following:

* A regular dictionary: `{'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3'}`
* A list of tuples: `[('a', '1'), ('b', '2'), ('c', '3')]`
* A MultiValueDict:  A MultiValueDict with the same key-value pairs as above.

Since the simplest and most common way to achieve this output is using a regular dictionary, we'll choose that as our predicted input.
