Let's analyze the code and the desired output to determine the input.

The function `mrr(data)` calculates the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).  The output format is a tuple: `(mean_mrr, [individual_mrrs])`.

In our case, the output is `[0.25, [0.25]]`. This tells us that the mean MRR is 0.25, and since the list of individual MRRs contains only one element (also 0.25), the input `data` must have been a single tuple representing just one ranking list.

The input `data` has the form `(sub_list, total_num)`.  `sub_list` is a list where a 1 at index `i` indicates that the item at rank `i+1` is relevant. `total_num` is not used in the calculation when `data` is a single tuple.

The MRR is calculated as `1/rank` where `rank` is the position of the first relevant item (where `sub_list` has a 1).  Since the MRR is 0.25, the rank must be 4 (because 1/4 = 0.25).

Therefore, the `sub_list` must have a 1 at index 3 (representing rank 4) and can have any values (0 or 1) at other indices.  Let's choose a simple example where the relevant item is at rank 4 and no other item is relevant: `[0, 0, 0, 1]`.  `total_num` can be any integer since it's not used in this case. Let's set it to 1.

So, the input `data` should be `([0, 0, 0, 1], 1)`.
