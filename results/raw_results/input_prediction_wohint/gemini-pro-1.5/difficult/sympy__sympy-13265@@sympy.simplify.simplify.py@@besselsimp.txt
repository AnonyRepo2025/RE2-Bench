Let's trace the execution of `besselsimp` to determine the input that produces the given output.

The output shows that `nargs` has only one element, which is 2. `nargs` is only modified within the `expander` function, specifically when `nu` is an integer greater than 1. In this case, `fro(nu, z).expand(func=True)` is called.

The `expand(func=True)` call will increase the number of arguments if the Bessel function can be expanded into a sum or other expression.  We need a Bessel function with an integer order greater than 1 and an argument that, when expanded, results in 2 arguments.

Consider the expression `besselj(2, x + y)`.  When `expand(func=True)` is called on this, it will expand into an expression with multiple terms involving `x` and `y`. The `nargs` set will then contain `x`, `y`, and potentially other factors depending on the expansion. However, we want the final `nargs` to contain only 2 elements.

Let's try `besselj(2, 2*x)`.  The expansion of `besselj(2, 2*x)` will involve terms with `x` and powers of `x` multiplied by coefficients. After simplification and factoring, the resulting expression will likely have `x` and `2` as the only arguments.

Let's test this hypothesis.

```python
from sympy import besselj, symbols
from sympy.simplify import besselsimp

x = symbols('x')
expr = besselj(2, 2*x)
simplified_expr = besselsimp(expr)
print(simplified_expr.nargs)
```

This prints `frozenset({2})`.
