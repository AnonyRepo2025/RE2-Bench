Let's break down how to achieve the given output for the `build_digest_header` function.

1. **Username, Realm, Nonce, Opaque, Algorithm:** These values are directly taken from the `self._thread_local.chal` dictionary.  We can see them clearly in the output string.

2. **URI:** The URI `/digest-auth/auth/user/pass` is derived from the input `url`.

3. **Response:** This is the crux of the digest authentication. It's calculated based on several factors including the username, password, realm, nonce, HTTP method, and URI.  The final response value in the output is `2a3292bcb01e5d08c466eacc7609d2b6`.

4. **qop, nc, cnonce:** The presence of `qop="auth"`, `nc=00000001`, and `cnonce="e2f9f401162cf240"` indicates that "auth" is in the `qop` list.  `nc` starts at 1, and `cnonce` is a randomly generated value.  Since `nc` is 1, this implies it's the first attempt for this nonce.

5. **Password:** The password is crucial for generating the correct response. We need to figure out the password that, when combined with the other parameters, results in the given response hash.  Since the algorithm is MD5, we can try common passwords or use a cracking tool (like John the Ripper or Hashcat) with the known parameters to find the password.  Given the context of the URI path `/digest-auth/auth/user/pass`, it's highly likely the password is "pass".

6. **Method:** The HTTP method (e.g., "GET", "POST") is also an input to the function and influences the response calculation.  The most common method is "GET", so we'll assume that for now.

Therefore, to get the desired output, we need to provide the following input:
