Let's trace the execution of `args_cnc` to determine the input that produces the given output.

The function `args_cnc` returns a tuple containing two elements: `coeff_c` and `coeff_nc + matrices`. The output shows both elements as `null`. This means both `coeff_c` and `coeff_nc + matrices` are empty lists.

1. **`coeff_c` is empty:** `coeff_c` represents the commutative part of the coefficient. It becomes empty if the initial `coeff_c` is `[1]` or `set([1])`. This happens when the `coeff` (obtained from `self.as_coeff_matrices()`) is just `1`.

2. **`coeff_nc + matrices` is empty:** This means both `coeff_nc` (the non-commutative part of the coefficient) and `matrices` are empty.  `matrices` being empty implies that the input `MatMul` expression contains no matrices. Since `coeff_nc` is also empty, the input expression must only contain commutative scalars that multiply to 1.

Therefore, the simplest input that satisfies these conditions is a `MatMul` with a single argument: `1`.
