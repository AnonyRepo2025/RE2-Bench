Let's trace the execution of `get_format` to determine the required input.

1. **Output Value:** The output "jS \\o\\f F" suggests a date format string.

2. **Caching:** The function first checks `_format_cache`. Since we're aiming for a specific output, let's assume the cache is empty to simplify the process.

3. **Localization (l10n):** The function checks `use_l10n`. If it's True and `lang` is None, it fetches the current language using `get_language()`.  If `use_l10n` is False, or a language is provided, it skips the format module lookup. The output format "jS \\o\\f F" is very specific and non-standard. It's highly likely this comes from a custom format module, meaning `use_l10n` must be True, and the language setting must correspond to a locale with this specific format.

4. **Format Modules:** If `use_l10n` is True, the function iterates through format modules obtained via `get_format_modules(lang)`. It looks for the `format_type` attribute within each module.  Our target format string must be defined in one of these modules.

5. **Settings Fallback:** If the format isn't found in any module, the function checks if `format_type` is in `FORMAT_SETTINGS`. If not, it returns `format_type` directly. If it is in `FORMAT_SETTINGS`, it retrieves the value from Django's settings.  Given the unusual output, it's unlikely to be a standard setting.

6. **ISO Input Formats:** If the format type is in `ISO_INPUT_FORMATS`, the function appends ISO inputs to the returned value. This isn't relevant in our case.

**Reasoning for Input:**

To get the output "jS \\o\\f F", we need:

* `format_type` to be 'DATE_FORMAT' (a common format type for dates).
* `use_l10n` to be True, so the custom format is looked up.
* `lang` to be None, so that `get_language()` is used.  We'll assume the active language is set such that it loads a format module containing 'DATE_FORMAT' = "jS \\o\\f F".  We don't need to specify the exact language, as the test setup will handle that.

  "format_type": "DATE_FORMAT",
