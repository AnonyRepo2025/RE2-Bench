Let's trace the execution of the `_complement` method with the provided context.

The output is a FiniteSet containing 10 and 15. This suggests the function returned a FiniteSet.  Looking at the code, the only branch that returns a FiniteSet without any Complement is this one:

```python
        return Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet)
```

Specifically, the part where `sifted[None]` is empty, resulting in the `else S.EmptySet` being executed. This means the `sifted` dictionary must only contain elements in `False`.

The `sifted` dictionary is created by:

```python
            sifted = sift(other, ternary_sift)
```

And `ternary_sift` is:

```python
            def ternary_sift(el):
                contains = self.contains(el)
                return contains if contains in [True, False] else None
```

So, for every element in `other` (which is a FiniteSet in our case), the `self.contains(el)` method is called. If the result is `True` or `False`, it's added to the `sifted` dictionary with that boolean value as the key. If the result is anything else (like `None` or a symbolic expression), it's added under the `None` key.

Since we want `sifted[None]` to be empty, and `sifted[False]` to contain 10 and 15, it means `self.contains(10)` and `self.contains(15)` must both return `False`.

Therefore, `self` must be a set that *does not* contain 10 or 15.  The simplest example would be the empty set.  Let's use that for the input `self`. The `other` input would be a FiniteSet containing 10 and 15.
