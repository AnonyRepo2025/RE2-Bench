1. **n_samples:** The output `y` has 200 samples, so `n_samples` must be 200.
2. **n_features:** The output `X` has 2 features, so `n_features` must be 2.
3. **n_classes:** The output `y` has values 0, 1, 2, and 3. Thus, there are 4 distinct classes, so `n_classes` must be 4.
4. **n_informative, n_redundant, n_repeated, n_useless:** Since `n_features` is 2, and we need `n_informative` to be at least `log2(n_classes * n_clusters_per_class)`, and `n_classes` is 4, the only possible combination is `n_informative=2`, and `n_redundant=0`, `n_repeated=0`, `n_useless=0`.
5. **n_clusters_per_class:** The data appears to be grouped into 4 classes, and within each class, there seems to be one main cluster. So, `n_clusters_per_class` is likely 1.
6. **weights:** The number of samples in each class appears roughly equal, suggesting `weights` is either None or balanced.  Let's assume it's None for simplicity.
7. **flip_y, class_sep, hypercube, shift, scale, shuffle, random_state:** These parameters influence the data distribution and arrangement. The specific values are difficult to infer directly from the output.  However, the output `X` values are quite large, suggesting scaling is involved.  Let's assume `random_state=0` for reproducibility and the rest of the parameters to their default values for simplicity.  The large values in `X` suggest a large `scale` and/or `shift`.  Let's assume `scale=100000` and `shift=0` as a starting point.
