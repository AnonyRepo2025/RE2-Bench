Let's trace the execution of `restify` to determine the input `cls` that produces the output ":obj:`tests.test_util_typing.T`".

1. **Initial Checks:** The function first checks if `cls` is `None`, `NoneType`, or `Ellipsis`. Since the output isn't any of those, these conditions are skipped.

2. **INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES:** The code checks if `cls` is in `INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES`.  Since the output doesn't match the format ':class:`%s`', this check is also skipped.

3. **isNewType:** The code calls `inspect.isNewType(cls)`. If this were true, the output would be ':class:`%s`'.  Since it's not, `isNewType(cls)` must return `False`.

4. **types_Union:** The code checks if `cls` is an instance of `types_Union`. The output doesn't contain " | ", so this condition is also false.

5. **__builtin__ or builtins:** The code checks if `cls.__module__` is '__builtin__' or 'builtins'. If it were, the output would be ':class:`%s`'. Since it's not, this check also fails.

6. **Python 3.7+:** The code then checks the Python version. Let's assume for now that the version is *not* 3.7 or higher, so `_restify_py37` is skipped.

7. **_restify_py36 (and others):**  Since none of the above conditions were met, the function must be reaching a point where it formats the output as ":obj:`%s`" % something. The "something" in our case is "tests.test_util_typing.T".  This suggests that the input `cls` is likely a class or type object whose representation is "tests.test_util_typing.T".

Therefore, the input `cls` should be a class or type object that can be represented as "tests.test_util_typing.T".  We don't have enough information to construct the actual class, but we can represent it with a placeholder.
