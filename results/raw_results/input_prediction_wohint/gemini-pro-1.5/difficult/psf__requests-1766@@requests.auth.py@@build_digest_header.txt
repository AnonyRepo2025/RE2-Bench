Let's break down the output to determine the input for `build_digest_header`.

The output string "Digest username=\"user\", realm=\"me@kennethreitz.com\", nonce=\"b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4\", uri=\"/digest-auth/auth/user/pass\", response=\"a15a1e022b6edf3943bcf7e43ca0ad07\", opaque=\"21d73260ff0b61c1f304ee40444f24bf\", algorithm=\"MD5\", qop=\"auth\", nc=00000002, cnonce=\"f06a18e88940ac77\"" is constructed piece by piece within the function.

1. **username, realm, nonce, opaque, algorithm, qop:** These values are taken directly from `self.chal`.  The output tells us exactly what these should be.

2. **uri:** This is the `url` argument passed to the function. The output shows it to be "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass".

3. **response:** This is the calculated digest.  Its value depends on the other parameters, including the password.  We can infer the password by noticing that the `nc` value is `00000002`. This implies this is the *second* call to the function with the same nonce. The first call would have `nc=00000001`.  The response value for the *first* call is predictable since the cnonce is deterministic for nc=1.  We can then use this knowledge to deduce the password.  However, since we are only asked for the input, we don't need to calculate the response. We know the password will be "pass" based on the uri.

4. **nc:** The output shows `nc=00000002`. This means `self.nonce_count` starts at 1 and is incremented before being formatted to eight hex digits.

5. **cnonce:** This is a hash generated using the nonce, nonce_count, current time, and random data. We don't need to predict this for the input, as it's generated within the function. The presence of "f06a18e88940ac77" confirms that nonce_count is 2.

6. **method:** This is the other argument to the function.  The A2 component of the digest calculation is formed using the method and the URI.  Given the URI and the response, we can deduce that the method is "GET".

Therefore, we can construct the input as follows:
