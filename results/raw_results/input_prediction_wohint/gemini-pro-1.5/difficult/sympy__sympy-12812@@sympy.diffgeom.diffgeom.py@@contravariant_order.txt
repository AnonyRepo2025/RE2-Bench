Let's analyze the code and determine an input that produces an output of 2.

The function `contravariant_order` calculates the contravariant order of an expression.  A contravariant order of 2 suggests a tensor product of two contravariant vectors or a single contravariant vector field raised to the power of 2.

Here's a breakdown of how we can achieve an output of 2:

1. **Tensor Product of Two Vectors:** If `expr` is a `TensorProduct` of two `BaseVectorField` instances, the function will return 2 (1 + 1).

2. **BaseVectorField raised to the power of 2:** If `expr` is a `Pow` where the base is a `BaseVectorField` and the exponent is a scalar (like 2), the function will return 2. However, the `covariant_order` of the base and exponent must be 0.

Let's choose the first option (Tensor Product) for simplicity.
