Let's trace the execution of `_sqlite_datetime_parse` to determine the required input `dt`, `tzname`, and `conn_tzname` for the given output.

1. **Output format:** The output "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00" suggests a datetime object with timezone information.

2. **`typecast_timestamp`:** The output includes both date and time, so `typecast_timestamp` will be called.  This function parses the string into a datetime object.  Critically, because the example output includes a timezone offset (+00:00), the `settings.USE_TZ` must be True for this offset to be preserved.

3. **`conn_tzname` and `tzname`:** The output has a timezone offset of +00:00 (UTC).  For this to happen, either `conn_tzname` must be None (or equal to tzname) and `tzname` must be None, or both must be None. If `conn_tzname` was set, and `tzname` was not, the output would be converted to the `conn_tzname` timezone. If `tzname` was set, the time would be converted to that timezone. If both were set and different, the time would be converted from `conn_tzname` to `tzname`.

4. **Input `dt`:** The input `dt` must be a string that `typecast_timestamp` can parse into the datetime object representing "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00".

Therefore, the input `dt` should be "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00", and both `tzname` and `conn_tzname` should be None.
