Let's trace the execution of `_mask_nc` to determine the input that produces the given output.

1. **Output Analysis:** The output `["x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n", null, null]` tells us a few things:
   - The masked expression is "x\*n\*m\*o\*n + n\*m\*n\*o\*m\*n". This means the original expression likely involved non-commutative symbols that were replaced by commutative dummies. However, since the second output element (the replacement dictionary) is `null`, it implies that either no replacements were made, or the input expression was already commutative.
   - The third output element (the list of non-commutative symbols) is also `null`. This reinforces the idea that the input expression was likely commutative or didn't contain any explicitly non-commutative symbols.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The function first checks `expr.is_commutative`. If it's true, it immediately returns the tuple `(eq, {}, [])`, which matches our output structure.

3. **Input Deduction:**
   - To get the observed output, the input expression `eq` must be commutative and equal to "x\*n\*m\*o\*n + n\*m\*n\*o\*m\*n".  The `name` argument doesn't affect the output in this case since no masking occurs.
