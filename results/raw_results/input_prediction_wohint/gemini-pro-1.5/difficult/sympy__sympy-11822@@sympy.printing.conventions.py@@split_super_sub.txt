Let's trace the execution of the `split_super_sub` function with different inputs to match the desired output.

The output is a tuple: `("alpha", ["+"], ["1"])`.

1. **name**: The first element of the tuple is "alpha". This suggests the initial part of the input `text` should be "alpha".

2. **supers**: The second element is a list containing "+". This means there should be a "^+" in the input `text`.

3. **subs**: The third element is a list containing "1". This can be achieved in two ways:
    - The input `text` starts with "alpha1". In this case, the regex `_name_with_digits_p` will match, extracting "1" as a subscript.
    - The input `text` contains "_1". In this case, it will be directly parsed as a subscript.

Let's try combining these:

- Input: "alpha^+_1"
- Output: ('alpha', ['+'], ['1'])

This input produces the desired output.
