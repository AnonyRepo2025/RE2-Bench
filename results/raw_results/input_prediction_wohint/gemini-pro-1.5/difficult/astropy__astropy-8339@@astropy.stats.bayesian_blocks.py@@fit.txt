Let's analyze the provided code and determine the input required to produce the given output.

The `fit` function calculates optimal change points in a dataset using a dynamic programming algorithm. The output is an array of change points (edges).  The core logic iteratively calculates a fitness vector (`fit_vec`) and updates `best` and `last` arrays to track the optimal segmentation.

The key to determining the input is understanding how the `edges` array is constructed and how the final `change_points` are selected.

1. **`edges` construction:** `edges = np.concatenate([t[:1], 0.5 * (t[1:] + t[:-1]), t[-1:]])`
   This means `edges` contains the first element of `t`, followed by the midpoints of consecutive elements of `t`, and finally the last element of `t`.

2. **`change_points` selection:** The code iteratively backtracks through the `last` array to determine the indices of the change points within the `edges` array.

Given the output `[ 4.36037718 48.45689469 52.59791734 99.45505108]`, we can deduce the following:

* The output contains 4 values, meaning there are 4 change points.
* These values correspond to elements within the `edges` array.

Let's assume a simple case where `t` has 5 elements. Then `edges` will also have 5 elements. If the output contains all the elements of `edges`, it means `change_points` contains indices [0, 1, 2, 3].

Let's assume `t` is `[a, b, c, d, e]`. Then `edges` would be `[a, (a+b)/2, (b+c)/2, (c+d)/2, e]`.

If the output is `[ 4.36037718 48.45689469 52.59791734 99.45505108]`, we can try to find a `t` that satisfies this.  Since the logic involves midpoints, it's difficult to directly invert the calculation.  However, we can make an educated guess and then refine it.

Let's assume `t` is `[4.36037718, 92.91378938, 57.19583468, 144.91010216, 99.45505108]`.  We can then calculate `edges` and see if the change points align with the output.

After calculating `edges` with the assumed `t`, we get:
`[4.36037718, 48.63708328, 75.05481203, 101.05296842, 99.45505108]`

This is close but not exactly the output.  We'll need to adjust `t` iteratively to get closer to the desired output.  However, since the question doesn't specify the `fitness` function, we can't precisely determine `t`.  We can only provide a reasonable guess.

For simplicity, let's assume a case where `t` is directly used as change points. This would mean the output is equal to `t`.
