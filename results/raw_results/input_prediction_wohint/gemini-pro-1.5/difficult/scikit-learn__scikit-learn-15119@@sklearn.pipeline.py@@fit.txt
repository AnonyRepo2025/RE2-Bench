The output shows that `steps`, `memory` and `verbose` are set to their default values (which are `None` for the first two, and `False` for the last one).  This means no values were passed for these parameters in the constructor.  The `transformer_list` is the only required parameter, so it must have been provided. Since the output doesn't show the fitted transformers, we can assume an empty list was passed for `transformer_list`.
