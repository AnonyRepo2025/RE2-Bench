Let's trace the execution of `_eval_product` to determine the input that produces the given output.

The output is `2**Sum(2*f(k), (k, 1, n))`. This suggests the input `term` involves a power of 2.  The presence of the `Sum` indicates that the exponent of the input `term` depends on `k` and the summation couldn't be evaluated directly.

Here's a possible scenario:

1. **term.is_Pow is True:** The input `term` is of the form `2**(2*f(k))`.
2. **term.base doesn't have k:** The base is 2, which doesn't involve `k`.
3. **summation(term.exp, (k, a, n)) is called:** The exponent `2*f(k)` is summed over `k` from `a` to `n`. This results in `Sum(2*f(k), (k, a, n))`.
4. **The final result is term.base**`**s`: This gives us `2**Sum(2*f(k), (k, a, n))`.

To match the output exactly, we need `a = 1`.
