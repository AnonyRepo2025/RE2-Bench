The output shows that `estimators_` and `named_estimators_` are empty, and `le_` and `classes_` are populated. This indicates that the `fit` method has not successfully completed.  The only way to get `estimators_` and `named_estimators_` to be null is if the input `self.estimators` is either None or an empty list.  Either of these will raise an AttributeError within the `fit` method. The output also shows that `estimators` is null. Therefore, the input must have an empty or None value for `estimators`.  Let's assume None for simplicity.  The other values in the output are irrelevant for determining the input to the `fit` method.
