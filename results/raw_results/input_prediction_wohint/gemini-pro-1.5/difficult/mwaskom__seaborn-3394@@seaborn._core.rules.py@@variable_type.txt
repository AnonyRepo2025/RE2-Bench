Let's trace the execution of `variable_type` to determine the input that produces the output "boolean".

1. **Output `boolean` implies the `boolean_type` parameter determines the returned value.**  This means the code must reach the conditional `if boolean_vector:` and `boolean_vector` must be True.

2. **`boolean_vector` becomes True when the series `vector` contains only 0s and 1s (or strictly boolean values if `strict_boolean` is True).**  The function `np.isin(vector, [0, 1]).all()` checks for this condition.

3. **To reach this condition, the other type checks must be bypassed.** This means:
    - `vector` cannot be a categorical type.
    - `vector` cannot be entirely NaN (otherwise, it would return 'numeric').
    - `vector` cannot be identified as numeric or datetime by `pd.api.types`.
    - The custom `all_numeric` and `all_datetime` checks must also return False.

4. **The simplest way to satisfy these conditions is to create a Series containing only 0s and 1s.**  This will trigger the boolean check and, since `boolean_type` defaults to 'numeric', the output will be 'numeric' unless we change `boolean_type` to 'boolean'.

Therefore, to get the output "boolean", we need to provide a Series with only 0s and 1s and set `boolean_type` to 'boolean'.
