[THOUGHT]
The code calculates and prints elements of an array X. The output is a single 0. This means the code only prints one element, which is 0. This happens when 2*K - 1 = 1, so K = 1.

Since the loop for calculating X starts from k=2, if K=1, the loop never executes, and all elements of X remain 0. The code then prints X[0], which is 0.

Therefore, K=1. N can be any value since it doesn't affect the number of elements printed when K=1. Let's choose N=1 for simplicity.
