Let's trace the execution of `_route_to_regex` to determine the input `route` that produces the given output.

The output regex is `^(?P\"<lang>\"[^/]+)\\/(?P\"<url>\".+)\\/$`.  The output converters dictionary has keys "lang" and "url", suggesting the input route contains these as parameters.

The regex components are:

1. `^`: Matches the beginning of the string. This is added at the start of `parts` in the function.
2. `(?P\"<lang>\"[^/]+)`: This captures a group named "lang". The `[^/]+` part suggests a converter that matches one or more characters that are not a forward slash. The extra double quotes around `<lang>` in the regex are unusual and likely a result of an error in the code or the way the output is generated. We'll assume the intended regex is `(?P<lang>[^/]+)`. This corresponds to a URL parameter like `<lang>`.
3. `\/`: Matches a forward slash. This is the escaped forward slash between the parameters in the route.
4. `(?P\"<url>\".+)`: This captures a group named "url". The `. +` part suggests a converter that matches one or more of any character. Again, assuming the intended regex is `(?P<url>.+)`, this corresponds to a URL parameter like `<url>`.
5. `\/`: Matches a forward slash. This is the escaped forward slash at the end of the route.
6. `$`: Matches the end of the string. This is added because `is_endpoint` is True.

Putting it all together, the input route should be `<lang>/<url>/`. The default converter for both `lang` and `url` if none is specified is `str`. The `str` converter's regex is `[^/]+` for `lang` and `. +` for `url`.
