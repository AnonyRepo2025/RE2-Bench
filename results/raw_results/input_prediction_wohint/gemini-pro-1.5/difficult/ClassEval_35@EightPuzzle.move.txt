The `move` function takes a state and a direction, and returns a new state with the blank tile moved in the specified direction. The output state is:

```
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [7, 0, 8],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
```

The blank tile is at position (1, 1). Let's consider the possible moves that could have resulted in this state:

- **Move 'up'**: The blank tile would have been at (2, 1) in the original state. The original state would be:

```
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [7, 5, 8],
    [4, 0, 3]
]
```

- **Move 'down'**: The blank tile would have been at (0, 1) in the original state. The original state would be:

```
[
    [1, 0, 2],
    [7, 6, 8],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
```

- **Move 'left'**: The blank tile would have been at (1, 2) in the original state. The original state would be:

```
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [7, 8, 0],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
```

- **Move 'right'**: The blank tile would have been at (1, 0) in the original state. The original state would be:

```
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [0, 7, 8],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
```
