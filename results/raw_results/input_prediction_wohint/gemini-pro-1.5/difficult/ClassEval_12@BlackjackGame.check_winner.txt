The output is "Player wins".  The `check_winner` function returns this when:

1. Both player and dealer bust, but the player's hand value is less than or equal to the dealer's.
2. The dealer busts, but the player does not.
3. Neither player nor dealer busts, and the player's hand value is greater than the dealer's.

Let's create some example inputs that satisfy these conditions:

* **Scenario 1:** Player has [10, 6, 6] (22) and Dealer has [10, 7, 5] (22). Player wins.
* **Scenario 2:** Player has [10, 9] (19) and Dealer has [10, 7, 5] (22). Player wins.
* **Scenario 3:** Player has [10, 9] (19) and Dealer has [10, 8] (18). Player wins.


Let's choose Scenario 2 for the input.
