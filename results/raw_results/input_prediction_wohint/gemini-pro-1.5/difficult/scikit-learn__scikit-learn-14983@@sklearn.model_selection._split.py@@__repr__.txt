The `__repr__` method uses the `_build_repr` function (not shown in the provided code).  However, the output format strongly suggests how `_build_repr` works. It seems to create a representation of the object by using the class name and listing the parameters and their values.

In this case, the output is `PredefinedSplit(test_fold="array([1, 1, 2, 2])")`. This tells us the class is `PredefinedSplit` and it has a parameter `test_fold` with a value of `np.array([1, 1, 2, 2])`.  The quotes around the array suggest that `_build_repr` converts the array to a string representation.

Therefore, the input to `__repr__` must be a `PredefinedSplit` object initialized with the given `test_fold` array.
