The output suggests that the diophantine equation is linear and involves a single parameter `t_0`. The solutions are expressed in terms of this parameter.  The output format matches the format returned by `_diop_linear` function when a linear diophantine equation is solved.

Let's assume the equation is of the form `ax + by = c`. The solutions are given by `x = x_0 + b/g * t` and `y = y_0 - a/g * t`, where `g = gcd(a, b)`.

From the output:
* `x = 3*t_0 - 5`
* `y = 2*t_0 - 5`

Comparing with the general solution:
* `x_0 = -5`
* `b/g = 3`
* `y_0 = -5`
* `-a/g = 2` or `a/g = -2`

Let's assume `g = 1`. Then `a = -2` and `b = 3`. The constant term `c` can be calculated by substituting `x_0` and `y_0` into the equation:
`c = ax_0 + by_0 = (-2)(-5) + (3)(-5) = 10 - 15 = -5`

So, the equation is `-2x + 3y = -5`.

We can rewrite this as `-2x + 3y + 5 = 0`.
