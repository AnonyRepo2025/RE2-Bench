Let's break down how to get the desired output from `euclidean_distances`.

1. **Output format:** The output is a NumPy array (represented as a nested list in JSON) with shape (1, 1) and a single value close to 1.165. This suggests we're calculating the Euclidean distance between two single-element vectors.

2. **`euclidean_distances` function:**  The function calculates the Euclidean distance between rows of `X` and `Y`. If `Y` is `None`, it calculates the distance between rows of `X` and itself.  Since our output is a 1x1 matrix, it's highly likely that both `X` and `Y` are single-row vectors, and `Y` is distinct from `X`.

3. **Formula:** The core calculation is based on this formula (simplified for single-row vectors):

   distance = sqrt(sum((x_i - y_i)^2))

4. **Reverse engineering:** We want a distance of approximately 1.165. Let's assume simple input vectors `X` and `Y`.  A bit of experimentation reveals that if:

   `X` = [1]
   `Y` = [2.2]

   Then:

   distance = sqrt((1 - 2.2)^2) = sqrt((-1.2)^2) = sqrt(1.44) ≈ 1.2

This is close, but not quite 1.165. Further refinement through trial and error (or a more systematic algebraic approach) leads us to:

   `X` = [1]
   `Y` = [2.165]  (since 1.165^2 ≈ 1.357)

   Then:

   distance = sqrt((1 - 2.165)^2) = sqrt((-1.165)^2) = 1.165

5. **Other parameters:** We'll keep the other parameters at their default values: `Y_norm_squared=None`, `squared=False`, `X_norm_squared=None`.
