[THOUGHT]
The output shows that `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` are all `null`. This suggests that the input `PartialDerivative` object was created with an expression that does not contain any `Tensors` or `Symbols` with indices.  Let's analyze the code to confirm this.

The `_expand_partial_derivative` function initializes `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` by calling `_contract_indices_for_derivative`. This function, in turn, calls `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices`.  If the input expression and variables do not contain any indices, `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices` will return empty tuples for `indices`, `free`, and `dum`.

Therefore, to get the desired output, we need to provide an input where `self.expr` and all elements in `self.variables` are either numbers or symbols without indices. The simplest example would be a derivative of a number with respect to a symbol.
