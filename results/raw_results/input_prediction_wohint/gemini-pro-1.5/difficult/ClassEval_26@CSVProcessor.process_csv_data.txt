The output of `process_csv_data` is 1, which means the `write_csv` function executed successfully. Let's analyze the flow.

1. The `process_csv_data` function takes `N` and `save_file_name` as input.
2. It reads a CSV file specified by `save_file_name` using `read_csv`.
3. It extracts the N-th column from the data.
4. It converts the elements in the extracted column to uppercase.
5. It creates new data consisting of the original title and the modified column.
6. It writes the new data to a new CSV file named `[original_file_name]_process.csv` using `write_csv`.

Since the output is 1, the write operation was successful. Let's create a dummy CSV file named `test.csv` as an example:

```
Name,Age,City
Alice,25,New York
Bob,30,London
Charlie,28,Paris
```

Let's assume N=2 (City column) and `save_file_name` is `test.csv`. The `process_csv_data` function will:

1. Read `test.csv`.
2. Extract the City column: `New York`, `London`, `Paris`.
3. Convert to uppercase: `NEW YORK`, `LONDON`, `PARIS`.
4. Create new data: `[['Name', 'Age', 'City'], ['NEW YORK', 'LONDON', 'PARIS']]`.
5. Write the new data to `test_process.csv`.

Since the output is 1, the write was successful.
