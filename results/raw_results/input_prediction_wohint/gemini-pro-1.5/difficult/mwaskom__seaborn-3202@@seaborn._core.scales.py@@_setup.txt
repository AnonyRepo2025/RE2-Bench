Let's trace the execution of the `_setup` method based on the provided output.

1. **`new = copy(self)`**: A copy of the `Nominal` object is created. The output shows some default values like `values`, `order`, `_tick_params`, `_label_params`, `_legend`, `_matplotlib_scale`, `_pipeline`, and `_spacer`.  These will be the initial state of `new`.

2. **Conditional blocks for tick and label params**:
   - `if new._tick_params is None: new = new.tick()`
   - `if new._label_params is None: new = new.label()`
   The output shows `_tick_params` and `_label_params` are initialized with `locator` and `formatter` set to `null`, respectively. This suggests that `new.tick()` and `new.label()` were *not* called.  This implies the initial `self` already had some non-null values for `_tick_params` and `_label_params`. However, since the final output has `null` for `locator` and `formatter`, we can assume the input `self._tick_params` and `self._label_params` had `locator` and `formatter` set to `null` as well.

3. **`stringify = np.vectorize(format, otypes=['object'])`**: This line doesn't depend on the input and just defines a function.

4. **`units_seed = categorical_order(data, new.order)`**: The output shows `_legend` as `[null, null]`.  Since `_legend` is assigned `(units_seed, list(stringify(units_seed)))` later in the code, this implies `units_seed` must be `None`.  Given that `new.order` is also `null` (from the output and the reasoning in step 2), we can infer that `data` must be empty or cause `categorical_order` to return `None`. An empty `Series` would achieve this.

5. **`mpl_scale = CatScale(data.name)`**: The output shows `_matplotlib_scale` as an empty dictionary `{}`. This suggests that `data.name` is likely an empty string or None. This further supports the idea that `data` is an empty `Series`.

6. **`if axis is None ...`**: The output doesn't give us direct information about `axis`. However, the code within this block modifies `axis` and `new._matplotlib_scale`. Since `_matplotlib_scale` is an empty dictionary in the output, it's likely that `axis` was `None` and the code inside this `if` block was executed.

7. **`new._pipeline = ...`**: The output shows `_pipeline` as `null`. This means the assignment within this block was not executed, which is consistent with `units_seed` being `None`.

8. **`new._spacer = spacer`**: The output shows `_spacer` as an empty dictionary `{}`. This is inconsistent with the code, which assigns the `spacer` function to `_spacer`. This is likely a mistake in the provided output.

Based on the above reasoning, the input should be an empty Series for `data`, `None` for `axis`, and the `Nominal` object should have `_tick_params` and `_label_params` initialized with `null` values for `locator` and `formatter` respectively. The `order` attribute of the `Nominal` object should also be `None`.
