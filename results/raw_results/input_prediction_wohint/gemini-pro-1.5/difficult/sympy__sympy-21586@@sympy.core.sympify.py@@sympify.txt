Let's trace the execution of `sympify` to determine the input that produces the given output.

The output `_args_set: {'2.00000000000000', '3'}` suggests that the input `a` is likely a `set` containing the elements that end up in `_args_set`.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input Type:** The input `a` must be a `set`.  Other iterable types like lists or tuples would retain their original type when processed by the `iterable(a)` block.

2. **Set Elements:** The elements of the set are '2.00000000000000' and '3'. These are strings.

3. **Code Path:** The code will execute the following path:

   - The initial checks for `__sympy__`, `CantSympify`, and registered converters will fail.
   - The code will enter the `if not isinstance(a, str):` block.
   - The numpy checks will be skipped because the input is a set.
   - The `if strict:` block will be skipped because `strict` defaults to `False`.
   - The code will enter the `if iterable(a):` block. Since `a` is a set, this condition is met.
   - Inside the loop, `sympify` will be called recursively on each element of the set.
   - For the element '2.00000000000000', the recursive call to `sympify` will convert it to a float (2.0) and then to a SymPy Float object.
   - For the element '3', the recursive call to `sympify` will convert it to an integer (3) and then to a SymPy Integer object.
   - The `type(a)` part ensures the result is a set.

Therefore, the input `a` should be a set containing the strings '2.00000000000000' and '3'.
