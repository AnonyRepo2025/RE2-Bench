Let's trace the execution of `_construct_simple` to determine the input that produces the given output.

The output `[{}, null]` suggests that the function returned `None`. This happens when none of the conditions for creating a specific domain are met. Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **Algebraic:** The output isn't related to algebraic numbers, so we can rule this out.

2. **Floats and Complexes:** If both floats and complexes are present, the domain would be `ComplexField`.

3. **Floats:** If only floats are present, the domain would be `RealField`.

4. **Rationals or opt.field:** If rationals are present or `opt.field` is true, the domain would be `QQ_I` (if complexes are present) or `QQ`.

5. **Integers:** If only integers are present, the domain would be `ZZ_I` (if complexes are present) or `ZZ`.

The function returns `None` if none of these conditions are met *and* there's a coefficient that doesn't fit into any of these categories.

Let's consider a simple example where `coeffs` contains a symbol.

[INPUT]
```json
{
  "coeffs": [
    "Symbol('x')"
  ],
  "opt": {}
}
```
