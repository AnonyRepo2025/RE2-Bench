The function `_get_kernel_params` retrieves kernel parameters. It prioritizes `self.kernel_params` if it's not None. If `self.kernel_params` is None, it creates an empty dictionary `params`. If the kernel is not callable and not 'precomputed', it iterates through kernel parameters defined in `KERNEL_PARAMS` for the specific kernel type. If any of these parameters are set in the Nystroem instance (e.g., `self.gamma`, `self.coef0`, `self.degree`), they are added to the `params` dictionary. However, if a callable or precomputed kernel is used, and `gamma`, `coef0`, or `degree` are provided, a ValueError is raised.

In this case, the output is a dictionary containing `coef0` and `degree`. This implies that `self.kernel_params` was None, and the kernel was not callable nor 'precomputed'. The `KERNEL_PARAMS` for the chosen kernel must include `coef0` and `degree`.
