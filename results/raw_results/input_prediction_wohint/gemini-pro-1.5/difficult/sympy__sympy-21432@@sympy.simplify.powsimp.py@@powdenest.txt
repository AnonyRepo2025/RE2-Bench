Let's trace the execution of `powdenest` to determine the input that produces "_x" as output.

1. **Initial simplification:** The function starts by calling `powsimp(sympify(eq))`.  We want this to return something that, after the `xreplace` operation, becomes "_x".

2. **The xreplace stage:** The `xreplace` function applies a transformation defined by `_denest_pow` to any `Pow` or `exp` terms in the expression.  Since we want the final result to be "_x", which is not a `Pow` or `exp`, this suggests that the expression after `powsimp` should not contain any such terms.  If it did, `_denest_pow` would be applied, potentially altering the expression further.

3. **Targeting _x:** The simplest way to achieve this is for `powsimp(sympify(eq))` to directly return "_x".  This means the input `eq` should be something that simplifies to "_x".

4. **Sympify and Dummy variables:** The `sympify` function converts a string into a SymPy expression.  If we input "_x" as a string, `sympify` will likely create a `Symbol` named "_x".  This is consistent with the desired output.

Therefore, the input should be the string "_x".
