[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the `encode_cf_datetime` function and its behavior to determine the input that produces the given output.

The output is a tuple: `(num, units, calendar)`.

1. **`calendar = "gregorian"`:** This suggests that the input `dates` likely contains datetime objects with the "gregorian" calendar.  Since the output calendar isn't 'proleptic_gregorian', the input dates are likely cftime objects.

2. **`units = "days since 2000-01-01"`:** This tells us that the units are "days" and the reference date is 2000-01-01. The `_cleanup_netcdf_time_units` function doesn't modify the units if the reference date is within the bounds of pandas Timestamp.

3. **`num = 10`:** This is the numerical representation of the date(s) relative to the reference date. Since the units are "days", this means the date is 10 days after 2000-01-01, which is 2000-01-11.

Given these deductions, the input `dates` should be a NumPy array or a list-like object containing a cftime datetime object representing 2000-01-11 with the "gregorian" calendar. The `units` and `calendar` arguments can be either provided explicitly or inferred. If they are inferred, the inference functions will determine the correct values based on the input `dates`.

To simplify, we can provide the `units` and `calendar` directly.
