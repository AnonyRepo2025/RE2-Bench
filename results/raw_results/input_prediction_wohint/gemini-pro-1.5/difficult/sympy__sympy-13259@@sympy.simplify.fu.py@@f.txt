Let's trace the execution of the `_osbornei` function and the inner `f` function to determine the input that produces "tanh(x)**(-3)".

The `_osbornei` function applies the inner function `f` bottom-up to the input expression. The `f` function checks if the current subexpression `rv` is a trigonometric function. If it is, it extracts the argument, performs a transformation based on the trigonometric function, and returns the hyperbolic counterpart.

We want the output to be `tanh(x)**(-3)`. This means the final expression should be a hyperbolic tangent raised to the power of -3.  Working backwards:

1. **tanh(x)**:  To get `tanh(x)`, the original expression must have contained `tan(x*I)`.  The `f` function transforms `tan(x*I)` into `tanh(x)/I`, and the `I` is removed by some simplification step outside of the provided code.

2. **tanh(x)**(-3): To get `tanh(x)**(-3)`, the original expression must have been `tan(x*I)**(-3)`.

Therefore, the input expression `e` should be `tan(I*x)**(-3)`.  The `d` variable is used for extracting the independent terms, and in this case, it should be `x`.
