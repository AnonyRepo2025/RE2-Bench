[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and determine the input arguments to achieve the given output.

1. **c:** The output `c` is "b". This means the input `c` was likely None, and the default value "b" was assigned within the function when `mpl.rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']` is True.

2. **colors:** The output `colors` is "[[0. 0. 1. 1.]]". This is the RGBA representation of "b". Since `c` is "b", the code inside the `if not c_is_mapped` block must have executed, converting "b" to its RGBA equivalent.

3. **edgecolors:** The output `edgecolors` is "r". This indicates that `edgecolors` was explicitly set to "r" as an input argument, overriding any default or derived value.

4. **kwargs:** The function uses `kwargs.pop` for 'facecolors', 'facecolor', 'edgecolor', and 'color'. Since the output `edgecolors` is "r", and not derived from 'color' or other kwargs, we can infer that 'edgecolor' was directly provided in the input kwargs.  Also, since `c` is "b", we know that 'color' kwarg was None, and 'facecolors' and 'facecolor' were also likely None or not provided.

5. **xsize:** The exact value of `xsize` isn't directly evident from the output. However, since the code doesn't raise any shape-related errors, we can assume `xsize` is consistent with the size of `c` (which is effectively 1 after converting the string "b" to an RGBA array).  We can choose a dummy value like 1 for simplicity.

6. **get_next_color_func:** This argument is not used when `c` is not None and `mpl.rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']` is True.

Based on this analysis, we can construct the following input:
