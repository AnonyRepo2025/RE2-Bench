1. **X and y shapes:** `support_` is of length 4, meaning X has 4 features. `grid_scores_` has length 4, implying the elimination process considered 4 feature subsets (from 4 to 1 features). `ranking_` is [4 3 2 1], which confirms the features were eliminated one by one. `estimator_.coef_` has shape (1,), meaning the final selected subset has 1 feature. This aligns with `n_features_ = 1`.

2. **X and y values:** The specific values within X and y don't directly influence the attributes like `support_`, `ranking_`, `n_features_`, or the shape of `estimator_.coef_`. However, they do affect `grid_scores_` and the values within `estimator_.coef_`. Since the output shows `grid_scores_` as all zeros, and `estimator_.coef_` as [1.], we can construct simple X and y data that would likely produce such results.  Let's assume a linear relationship where the last feature perfectly predicts y, and all other features are irrelevant.

3. **cv:** The output `cv=5` indicates 5-fold cross-validation was used.

4. **estimator:** The output shows `estimator` and `estimator_` with `foo_param: 0`. This suggests a custom estimator with a parameter named `foo_param`.  The fitted estimator (`estimator_`) also has a `coef_` attribute, suggesting a linear model.

5. **Other parameters:** `step=1`, `scoring=null`, `verbose=0`, `n_jobs=null`, `min_features_to_select=1` are directly reflected in the output.

Based on this reasoning, we can construct the following input:
