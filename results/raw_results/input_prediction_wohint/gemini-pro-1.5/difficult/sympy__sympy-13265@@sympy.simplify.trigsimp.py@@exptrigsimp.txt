[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of `exptrigsimp` to determine the input that produces "1/(y*tanh(1))".

1. **Initial Simplification:** The `bottom_up` function with `exp_trig` attempts to rewrite the expression in terms of exponentials or cosines, choosing the form with the fewest operations.  Since the output involves `tanh`, which is related to exponentials, it's likely the input also involves exponentials or hyperbolic functions.

2. **The `f` function:** This function within `bottom_up` looks for specific patterns involving exponentials and rewrites them using hyperbolic functions. The key pattern that leads to `tanh` is:

   ```
   newd[1 - sign * S.Exp1 ** x] == -m
   ...
   newd[-c * tanh(x / 2)] += m 
   ```

   This suggests the input expression likely contains a term like `1 - exp(x)` or `exp(x) - 1`.

3. **Hyperbolic to Trigonometric:** The code then checks for hyperbolic functions and converts them to trigonometric functions using `hyper_as_trig` and `TR2i`. However, since the output contains `tanh`, this conversion likely doesn't happen, or is reversed later.

4. **Final `TR2i`:** The code applies `TR2i` one last time. This function simplifies trigonometric expressions. Since the output is in terms of `tanh`, this final `TR2i` call likely doesn't significantly change the expression.

5. **Considering the output `1/(y*tanh(1))`:** This suggests the input might be something like `1/(y*(exp(2) - 1)/(exp(2) + 1))` because `tanh(1) = (exp(2) - 1)/(exp(2) + 1)`.  However, the `f` function within `exptrigsimp` rewrites expressions involving `(1 - exp(x))` to `tanh(x/2)`.  To get `tanh(1)`, we need `x/2 = 1`, so `x = 2`.  Therefore, a potential input is `1/(y*(1 - exp(-2)))`.

Let's try `1/(y*(1 - exp(-2)))` as the input.
