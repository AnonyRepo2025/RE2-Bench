Let's trace the execution of `nsimplify` to determine the input that produces "GoldenRatio/2".

1. **Initial Simplification:** The function first attempts to convert the input to an integer using `as_int`. If this fails (as it will for our target output), it proceeds to sympify the input.

2. **Infinity Check:** It checks if the sympified expression is infinity.  Since our target isn't infinity, it continues.

3. **Rational/Symbolic Check:** The function then checks if `rational` is True or if the expression contains free symbols. If so, it calls `_real_to_rational`.  Our target output contains `GoldenRatio`, a symbolic expression, so this condition *might* be met. However, if `rational` is explicitly set to `False`, this branch is skipped.

4. **Tolerance and Precision:** If the code reaches this point, it sets a tolerance and precision for numerical evaluation.

5. **Constants Handling:** The code processes any provided constants. We don't need any constants for our target output.

6. **Numerical Evaluation:** The expression is evaluated numerically using `evalf`.

7. **Real and Imaginary Parts:** The real and imaginary parts of the numerical result are extracted.

8. **`nsimplify_real` Function:** This function attempts to find a rational approximation or symbolic representation for each part (real and imaginary).  It uses `mpmath.identify` which can recognize certain constants like pi, e, and the Golden Ratio.

9. **Rational Conversion:** If `nsimplify_real` fails, and `rational` is not explicitly set to `False`, the function falls back to `_real_to_rational`.

10. **Final Result:** The function combines the simplified real and imaginary parts. If the result is different from the original expression or `rational` is False, it returns the simplified version. Otherwise, it returns the result of `_real_to_rational`.


**Reasoning for the Input:**

To get "GoldenRatio/2", we need `mpmath.identify` to recognize the Golden Ratio.  The simplest way to achieve this is to provide an input that evaluates to (1 + sqrt(5))/4, which is half the Golden Ratio.  We also want to avoid triggering the `_real_to_rational` fallback, so we'll set `rational` to `False`.
