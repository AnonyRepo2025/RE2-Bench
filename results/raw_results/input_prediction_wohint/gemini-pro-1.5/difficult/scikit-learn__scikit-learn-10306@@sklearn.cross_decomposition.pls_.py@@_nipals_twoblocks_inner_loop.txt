Let's analyze the `_nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop` function and determine the input that produces the given output.

The output consists of `x_weights`, `y_weights`, and `ite`.  `x_weights` and `y_weights` are normalized in each iteration. The loop stops when the change in `x_weights` is below the tolerance (`tol`) or the maximum number of iterations (`max_iter`) is reached, or Y has only one column.

Given the output:

* `x_weights` (shape (3,1)): `[[-0.01672891], [ 0.91984997], [-0.39191157]]`
* `y_weights` (shape (2,1)): `[[ 1.00000000e+00], [ 2.07317191e-08]]`
* `ite`: 4

Since `ite` is 4, the loop ran 4 times before converging. The `y_weights` being almost `[[1], [0]]` suggests that the first column of Y strongly influences the solution.  The small non-zero value in the second element of `y_weights` is likely due to numerical precision limitations within the iterative process.

To find suitable `X` and `Y`, we need to reverse-engineer the calculations within the loop. This is difficult to do precisely due to the iterative nature and the normalization steps. However, we can make some educated guesses and then refine them through trial and error.

Let's start by assuming `mode` is 'A' (the default).  We can also assume `tol` is `1e-06` (the default) and `max_iter` is at least 4.  `norm_y_weights` is likely False, given the magnitude difference in `y_weights`.

We know that in each iteration:

1. `x_weights` is computed based on `y_score` and `X`.
2. `x_score` is computed as `np.dot(X, x_weights)`.
3. `y_weights` is computed based on `x_score` and `Y`.
4. `y_score` is computed as `np.dot(Y, y_weights)` (normalized).

Since `y_weights` is close to `[[1], [0]]`, `y_score` will be close to the first column of `Y`.  This suggests that the first column of `Y` is a good starting point for `y_score`.

Let's try a simple `Y` and `X` and see if we can get close to the output:

```python
Y = np.array([[1, 0.1], [0.1, 1]])
X = np.array([[1, 0.1, 0.2], [0.1, 1, 0.3], [0.2, 0.3, 1]])
```

We'll then run the function with these values and adjust them based on the results.
