[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of `_matrix_derivative(expr, x)` to determine the required input `expr` that produces the given output.

1. **Output Analysis:** The output represents a `ZeroMatrix` with 2 rows and 2 columns. This means the derivative of the input matrix `expr` with respect to `x` resulted in a zero matrix.

2. **`_matrix_derivative` function:**
   - It calculates the derivative of a matrix expression `expr` with respect to a variable `x`.
   - It uses `expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)` which in turn calls `self._eval_derivative(x)`.
   - `_eval_derivative` applies a function element-wise to the matrix. The function in this case is `lambda x: x.diff(arg)`.
   - The result of `x.diff(arg)` is used to construct a new matrix with the same dimensions as the original.

3. **Reasoning:** To get a `ZeroMatrix` as output, each element of the input matrix `expr` must have a derivative of zero with respect to `x`. This happens when each element of `expr` is either a constant or independent of `x`.

4. **Input Construction:**
   - We can create a 2x2 matrix `expr` with constant values. The simplest example is a matrix filled with zeros.
