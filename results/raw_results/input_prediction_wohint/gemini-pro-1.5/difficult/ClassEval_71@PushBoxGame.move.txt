To get the output `False`, the game should not be won after the move. Let's consider a simple scenario where the player moves but doesn't push a box onto a target.

Assume the following initial map:

```
#####
#P B#
#. T#
#####
```

P = Player
B = Box
T = Target
# = Wall
. = Empty space

If the player moves right ('d'), the new map will be:

```
#####
# PB#
#. T#
#####
```

The box is not on the target, so the game is not won.
