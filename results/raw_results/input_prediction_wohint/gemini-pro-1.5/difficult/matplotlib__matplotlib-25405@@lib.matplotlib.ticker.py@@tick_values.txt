Let's analyze the code and determine the input values for `vmin`, `vmax`, `numticks`, `_base`, and `_subs` that produce the desired output `[1.e-01 1.e+00 1.e+01 1.e+02 1.e+03 1.e+04]`.

1. **Output Analysis:** The output consists of powers of 10, ranging from 10⁻¹ to 10⁴. This suggests a logarithmic scale with a base of 10.

2. **`_base`:**  Since the output is in powers of 10, `self._base` must be 10.

3. **`_subs`:** The output only contains powers of 10, without any intermediate values (e.g., 2*10⁰, 5*10⁰). This indicates that `_subs` should either be `[1.0]` or a string like 'auto'.  If `len(subs)` is greater than 1 and `stride` is 1, the code checks if there are more than one tickloc between vmin and vmax. If not, it defaults to `AutoLocator()`.  Given our output has multiple values, we can assume `_subs` is likely `[1.0]` or 'auto'.

4. **`vmin` and `vmax`:** The output range is from 0.1 to 10000.  Therefore, `vmin` should be less than or equal to 0.1, and `vmax` should be greater than or equal to 10000.  Let's assume `vmin = 0.1` and `vmax = 10000` for now.

5. **`numticks`:** The output has 6 tick values.  If `numticks` is 'auto', the code determines the number of ticks based on `axis.get_tick_space()`, clipped between 2 and 9.  If we assume `numticks` is not 'auto', then `numticks` should be 6. Let's try with `numticks = 6`.

6. **Simulate with `numticks = 6`, `_base = 10`, `_subs = [1.0]`, `vmin = 0.1`, `vmax = 10000`:**

   - `log_vmin = -1`
   - `log_vmax = 4`
   - `numdec = 5`
   - `stride = 1` (since `numdec // numticks + 1 = 5 // 6 + 1 = 1`)
   - `decades = np.arange(-2, 6, 1) = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - `ticklocs = 10**decades = [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000]`
   - The code then filters `ticklocs` to be within `[vmin, vmax]`, which gives `[0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]`. This matches the desired output.

Therefore, the input values are likely `vmin = 0.1`, `vmax = 10000`, `numticks = 6`, `_base = 10`, and `_subs = [1.0]`.
