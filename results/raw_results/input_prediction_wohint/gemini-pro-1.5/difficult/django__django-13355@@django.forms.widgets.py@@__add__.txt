The `__add__` method adds the `css` and `js` lists of `other` to `self` if they are not already present. The output shows that both `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` are null, which means the lists from `other` were not added. This happens when `other`'s lists are either empty or already present in `self`.

Let's consider a case where both `self` and `other` have identical, non-empty lists.
