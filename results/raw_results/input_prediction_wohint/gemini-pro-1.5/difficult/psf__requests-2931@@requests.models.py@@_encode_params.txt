Let's trace the execution of `_encode_params` to determine the required input `data` that produces the output "z=1&a=1&k=1&d=1".

The function handles different types of input `data`:

1. **str or bytes:** Returns `data` directly. This doesn't match our output, which is a urlencoded string.

2. **File-like object:** Returns `data` directly.  This also doesn't match our output.

3. **Iterable:** Iterates through the key-value pairs, URL-encodes them, and joins them with '&'. This is the relevant case for our output.

4. **Other:** Returns `data` directly. This doesn't match our output.

Since our output is a urlencoded string, we focus on the iterable case. The `to_key_val_list` function converts a dictionary or a list of tuples into a list of tuples. The `urlencode` function then encodes this list of tuples into a urlencoded string.

To get "z=1&a=1&k=1&d=1", we need the following key-value pairs (order matters because the output preserves the order):

* ("z", "1")
* ("a", "1")
* ("k", "1")
* ("d", "1")

These pairs can be provided as a list of tuples or a dictionary. Let's use a dictionary for simplicity.
