Let's trace back how `1.0e-14*I` could be produced.

The most likely path to get a float representation of an imaginary number is when the input expression contains floats and `rational` is not explicitly set to `True`. In this scenario, `nfloat` is called on the expression.

If we provide `1e-14*I` as input, the simplification process won't alter it significantly, and the `nfloat` call will convert it to the observed output.
