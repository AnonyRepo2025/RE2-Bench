The function `__eq__` returns `True` if the two objects being compared are equal.  Since the output is `True`, we know that `self` and `other` must be equal. The simplest way to achieve this is to make `self` and `other` the same object.  There are other ways to make them equal, but without more information, this is the most straightforward approach.
