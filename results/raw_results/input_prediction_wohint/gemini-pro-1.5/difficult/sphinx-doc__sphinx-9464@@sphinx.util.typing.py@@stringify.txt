Let's trace the execution of the `stringify` function with different potential inputs to arrive at the desired output.

The output `"tests.test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\""` suggests that the input `annotation` is likely a class defined within the `tests.test_util_typing` module, and its name is enclosed in angle brackets. This format is produced in the `_stringify_py37` or `_stringify_py36` branch, specifically when dealing with a `typing._GenericAlias` (prior to Python 3.9) or `typing._SpecialForm` (for types like `Union`, `Optional`, etc.).

Since the output includes the module path and class name, the input annotation must be a forward reference.  The angle brackets indicate it's a string representation of a class not yet defined when the type hint was created.

Therefore, the input should be a forward reference string like `'tests.test_util_typing.MyClass2'`.
