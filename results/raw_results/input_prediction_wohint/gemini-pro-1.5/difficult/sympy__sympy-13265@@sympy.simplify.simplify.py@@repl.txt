Let's trace the execution to determine the input of `repl` that produces the given output.

The output shows that `nargs` contains a `frozenset({2})`. This `nargs` is the result of `factors.intersection(Mul.make_args(z))`.

`factors` is a set created from the `factors` argument passed to `replacer`.  In the code, `replacer` is called twice with `ifactors` and twice with `minusfactors`.

* `ifactors = [I, exp_polar(I*pi/2), exp_polar(-I*pi/2)]`
* `minusfactors = [-1, exp_polar(I*pi)]`

`Mul.make_args(z)` converts `z` into a tuple of its factors if `z` is a `Mul` object. Otherwise, it returns a tuple containing just `z`.

We're looking for a `z` such that its intersection with either `ifactors` or `minusfactors` results in the `frozenset({2})`.  However, none of the elements in `ifactors` or `minusfactors` are equal to 2. This means `z` must be a `Mul` object, and one of its factors must be 2, while the other factors, when combined with either `ifactors` or `minusfactors`, produce an empty set upon intersection.

Since we want the simplest input, let's assume `z` is simply `2`.  In this case, `Mul.make_args(z)` would return `(2,)`. The intersection of this with `ifactors` or `minusfactors` would be an empty set, not `{2}`.

Let's consider `z = 2*x` where x is a symbol. `Mul.make_args(2*x)` would return `(2, x)`.  If we choose `factors` to be `ifactors`, the intersection would depend on `x`. If `x` is not in `ifactors`, the intersection would be `{2}`.

Let's choose `x=Symbol('x')`.
