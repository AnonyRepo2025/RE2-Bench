Let's trace the execution of the `fraction` function with different inputs to understand how it produces the given output.

The output `["-x**3", "1"]` suggests that the input expression, after simplification, resulted in a numerator of `-x**3` and a denominator of `1`.

The `fraction` function iterates through the terms of a `Mul` object.  If a term is a `Pow` and the exponent is negative, it moves the term to the denominator. If the exponent is positive, it stays in the numerator. Rationals are split into numerator and denominator parts.

Here's how we can achieve the desired output:

1. **Input: `-x**3`**:  This is the simplest input that would produce the given output. The input is already in the desired numerator/denominator form. The function will process `-x**3` as a single term. Since it's not a fraction or doesn't have a negative exponent, it will be placed in the numerator. The denominator will default to 1.
