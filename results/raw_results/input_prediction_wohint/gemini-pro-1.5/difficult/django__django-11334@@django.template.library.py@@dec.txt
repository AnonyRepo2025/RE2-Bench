Let's trace the execution of the `simple_tag` method and its inner `dec` function.

1. The provided output represents the attributes of the `func` object that is passed to `dec`.  Specifically, the output shows the `func` object *after* `functools.wraps` has been applied.

2. The `functools.wraps(func)` decorator updates `compile_func` with the attributes of the original `func`. This is why the output shows `compile_func` having the same `__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, etc., as the original `func`.

3. Therefore, the input to `dec` should be a function object with the same attributes as shown in the output, but *before* the `functools.wraps` decorator is applied.  Since we don't have any specific implementation details of the original function, we can represent it as an empty dictionary or a simple lambda function.
