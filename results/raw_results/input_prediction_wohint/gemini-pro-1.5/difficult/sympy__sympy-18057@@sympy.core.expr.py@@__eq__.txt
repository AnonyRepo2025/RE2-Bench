Let's analyze the code and determine the input that leads to the output `True`.

The `__eq__` method compares two Expr objects for equality.  Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Identity Check:** `if self is other: return True` - If the two objects are the same instance, they are equal.

2. **Type Check:** If the types are different, it attempts to sympify `other`. If `other` cannot be sympified or is not an `Expr`, it returns `False`. If both are `Number` but of different types, and one is not an instance of the other's type, it returns `False`.

3. **Hashable Content Check:** It compares the `_hashable_content` of both objects. If they are different, it returns `False`.

4. **Number Type Check (for Numbers):** If both are `Number` instances, it checks if they are of the same type. If not, it returns `False`.

5. **Return True:** If all checks pass, it returns `True`.

To get `True` as output, we need to satisfy one of the first two conditions. The simplest way is to make `self` and `other` the same object.  Another way is to make them different instances of the same type with the same `_hashable_content`.

Let's choose the simplest approach: making `self` and `other` refer to the same object.  We can use an Integer, like `1`.
