Let's analyze the execution of the `urlencode` function to determine the required input for the given output.

The `urlencode` function processes the input `query` based on its type. If it's a `MultiValueDict`, it calls the `lists()` method. Otherwise, if it has an `items()` method, it uses that.  The core logic lies in iterating through the (key, value) pairs and encoding them into a URL query string.

The output "a=1&b=2&c=3" suggests a simple dictionary or list of tuples as input.  Let's consider both cases:

1. **Dictionary input:**

```python
query = {'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3'}
```

In this case, `urlencode(query)` would directly iterate through the dictionary items and produce the desired output.

2. **List of tuples input:**

```python
query = [('a', '1'), ('b', '2'), ('c', '3')]
```

Similarly, `urlencode(query)` would iterate through the list of tuples and produce the desired output.

3. **MultiValueDict input:**
Since the output doesn't contain any repeated keys, a MultiValueDict is also a possibility. The `lists()` method of MultiValueDict returns an iterator that yields (key, value_list) pairs.  For our output, each value_list would contain a single element.

```python
from django.utils.datastructures import MultiValueDict

query = MultiValueDict({'a': ['1'], 'b': ['2'], 'c': ['3']})
```

All three of these input options would produce the desired output. For simplicity, let's choose the dictionary input.

[INPUT]
```json
{
  "query": {
    "a": "1",
    "b": "2",
    "c": "3"
  },
  "doseq": false
}
```
[/INPUT]
