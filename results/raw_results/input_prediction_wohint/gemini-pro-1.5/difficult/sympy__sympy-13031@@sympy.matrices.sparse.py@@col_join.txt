Let's trace the execution of `col_join` to determine the input.

1. **Output `_smat`:** The output `_smat` has two entries: `(0, 0): 1` and `(1, 0): 2`. This suggests that the resulting matrix has 2 rows and 1 column.

2. **Output `rows` and `cols`:** The output confirms the dimensions: 2 rows and 1 column.

3. **`col_join` logic:** The `col_join` method joins two matrices `A` and `B` column-wise.  The resulting matrix has the same number of columns as `A` and `B` (which must be equal) and the number of rows is the sum of the rows of `A` and `B`.

4. **Reconstructing `A` and `B`:** Since the output matrix has 2 rows and 1 column, there are several possibilities for the input matrices `A` and `B`:
    * **Case 1:** `A` is a 1x1 matrix and `B` is a 1x1 matrix.
    * **Case 2:** `A` is a 2x1 matrix and `B` is a 0x1 matrix.
    * **Case 3:** `A` is a 0x1 matrix and `B` is a 2x1 matrix.

Let's consider each case:

* **Case 1:** If `A` is `[(1)]` and `B` is `[(2)]`, the result would be `[(1), (2)]`, which matches the output.

* **Case 2:** If `A` is `[(1), (2)]` and `B` is empty (0 rows), the result would be `[(1), (2)]`, which also matches the output.

* **Case 3:** If `A` is empty and `B` is `[(1), (2)]`, the code handles this by effectively making A a 0x1 matrix and then appending B, resulting in `[(1), (2)]`.

Since the simplest explanation is often the correct one, let's choose Case 1 as the most likely input.
