[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

The function f takes a list nums. It iterates over the indices of nums (using range(len(nums))). For each index i, if nums[i] is divisible by 3, it appends nums[i] to the end of nums. After the loop, it returns nums.

Now, let's look at the output:
[1, 3, 3]

Let's try to reconstruct the input that would produce this output.

Suppose the input is [1, 3].

- Initial nums: [1, 3]
- len(nums) is 2, so i will go from 0 to 1.

i = 0:
- nums[0] = 1, 1 % 3 != 0, so nothing happens.

i = 1:
- nums[1] = 3, 3 % 3 == 0, so nums.append(3)
- nums is now [1, 3, 3]

Now, len(nums) was 2 at the start, so the loop only goes for i = 0 and i = 1. The appended 3 at the end is not processed in this loop.

So, the output is [1, 3, 3], which matches the given output.

Therefore, the input must have been [1, 3].
