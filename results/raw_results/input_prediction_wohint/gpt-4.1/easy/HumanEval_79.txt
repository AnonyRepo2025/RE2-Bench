[THOUGHT]
The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `decimal`, converts it to its binary representation using `bin(decimal)[2:]` (which strips the '0b' prefix), and then adds 'db' to the start and end of the resulting string.

Given the output is "db1100111db", the part between the 'db' markers is "1100111". This is the binary representation of the input integer.

To find the input, I need to convert "1100111" from binary to decimal:
"1100111" in binary = 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0
= 64 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 103

So, the input decimal must have been 103.
