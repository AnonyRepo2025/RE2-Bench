[THOUGHT]
The `__delitem__` method deletes an item from the internal dictionary `_data` using a key that is first converted by `_convert_key`. The `_convert_key` method, if the key is a string, calls `_to_camel_case(key)`. However, the implementation of `_to_camel_case` is not shown, but we can infer that it converts a string to camelCase.

The output is `null`, which means the function returns nothing (i.e., it just performs the deletion). There is no information about exceptions, so we can assume the key existed and was deleted successfully.

To call `__delitem__`, we need:
- an instance of `CamelCaseMap` (the `self` parameter)
- a `key` argument

Since the function only deletes the key, and the output is always `None`, any key that exists in `_data` would work. The input should specify the instance and the key.

Since the function is called as `obj[key] = value` for setting and `del obj[key]` for deleting, the input should be the instance and the key to delete.
