The function extract_file tries to extract a file named file_name from the zip archive self.file_name into output_path. If successful, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The output is true, so:
- The zip file (self.file_name) exists and is a valid zip archive.
- The file file_name exists inside the zip archive.
- The extraction to output_path succeeded.

We don't know the actual file names, but we can infer that:
- self.file_name is a valid zip file path (e.g., "archive.zip").
- file_name is a file that exists inside the zip (e.g., "document.txt").
- output_path is a valid directory path (e.g., "./extracted").

So, the input should be:
self: { "file_name": "archive.zip" }
args: { "file_name": "document.txt", "output_path": "./extracted" }
kwargs: {}
