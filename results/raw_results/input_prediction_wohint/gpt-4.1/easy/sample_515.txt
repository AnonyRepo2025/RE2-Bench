[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. `result = array.copy()`  
   - Makes a shallow copy of the input list.

2. `result.reverse()`  
   - Reverses the list in place.

3. `result[:] = [item * 2 for item in result]`  
   - Replaces the contents of `result` with a new list where each item is doubled.

4. `return result`  
   - Returns the modified list.

Given the output: `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`

Let's reverse engineer:

- The final result is `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.
- This is after doubling each element of the reversed input list.

So, before doubling, the reversed list was `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` (since 10/2=5, 8/2=4, etc).

Therefore, the reversed input was `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

So, the original input must have been `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (since reversing `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` gives `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`).

Thus, the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
