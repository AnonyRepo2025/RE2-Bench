The function f takes two arguments: text and use. It returns text.replace(use, ''), i.e., it removes all occurrences of the substring use from text.

The output is: "Chris requires  ride to the irport on Fridy."

Let's try to deduce what was removed from the original text.

First, notice the double space between "requires" and "ride". That suggests a word or substring was removed there.

Also, "airport" is now "irport", and "Friday" is now "Fridy". So, the substring "a" was removed from "airport" and "Friday".

Let's check if "a" is the substring being removed.

Original: "Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday."
Remove all "a": "Chris requires  ride to the irport on Fridy."

This matches the output exactly.

Therefore, the input must have been:
text = "Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday."
use = "a"
