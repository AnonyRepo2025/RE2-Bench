[THOUGHT]
The function get_min returns the minimum value of the data array stored in the DataStatistics2 object. The output is "-3", which means np.min(self.data) == -3. This means that the data array must contain at least one value of -3, and all other values (if any) must be greater than or equal to -3. The input to get_min is just self (the instance), so the only relevant input is the data used to construct the DataStatistics2 object. The output is a string "-3", but np.min returns a number, so likely the output is stringified for the output format.

Therefore, the input should be a data array containing -3 as its minimum value. The simplest such array is [-3], but it could also be, for example, [1, 2, -3, 4]. Since the output is just -3, and no other information is given, the minimal input is likely [-3].

The get_min method does not take any arguments except self, so args and kwargs are empty.
