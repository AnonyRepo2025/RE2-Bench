[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes a single argument, `string`.
2. It applies `string.title()`, which capitalizes the first letter of each word and makes the rest lowercase.
3. Then it applies `.replace(' ', '')`, which removes all spaces.

The output is `"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"`.

Let's try to reverse-engineer the input.

First, since spaces are removed, the output has no spaces. But the `.title()` method would have capitalized the first letter of each word (where "word" is defined by being separated by whitespace or certain punctuation).

But in Python, `str.title()` also capitalizes after hyphens, so for example:
```python
"foo-bar".title()  # "Foo-Bar"
```
So, let's try to reconstruct the input.

The output is: "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"

Let's try to split it by hyphens: ["1Oe", "ErrBzz", "Bmm"]

But notice that "ErrBzz" is not a typical title-case word, unless the input was "err bzz" (with a space), but spaces are removed after title().

But let's try to reconstruct the input before `.replace(' ', '')`:

Suppose the input was: "1oe-err bzz-bmm"

Apply `.title()`:
- "1oe-err bzz-bmm".title() → "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm"

Then `.replace(' ', '')`:
- "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm" → "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"

This matches the output.

Therefore, the input string is "1oe-err bzz-bmm".
