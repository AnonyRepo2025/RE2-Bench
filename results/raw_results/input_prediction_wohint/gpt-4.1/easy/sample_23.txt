[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes two arguments: `text` (a string) and `chars` (a string or possibly None/empty).
2. If `chars` is truthy (not empty), it does: `text = text.rstrip(chars)`. This removes all trailing characters in `chars` from the end of `text`.
3. If `chars` is falsy (empty string or None), it does: `text = text.rstrip(' ')`. This removes all trailing spaces from the end of `text`.
4. If the resulting `text` is empty, it returns `'-'`.
5. Otherwise, it returns the resulting `text`.

Given the output is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`, this means that after the rstrip operation, the string is exactly that.

Let's consider what possible inputs could produce this output.

Case 1: `chars` is empty or None.
- Then, only trailing spaces are removed.
- So, if the input `text` was `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."` (with no trailing spaces), the output would be the same.
- If the input `text` was `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.   "` (with trailing spaces), the output would be `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.

Case 2: `chars` is not empty.
- Then, all trailing characters in `chars` are removed from the end of `text`.
- But since the output ends with a period, if `chars` included `.`, the period would be stripped. So `chars` must not include `.`.
- If `chars` included any of the trailing characters, those would be stripped.

But since the output is not stripped of any characters, it's likely that either:
- There were no trailing characters to strip, or
- The `chars` argument was empty, so only spaces would be stripped.

Therefore, the most likely input is:
- `text` is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."` (possibly with or without trailing spaces)
- `chars` is `""` (empty string), so only spaces are stripped.

Alternatively, `text` could be `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.   "` (with trailing spaces), and `chars` is `""`.

Either way, the function would return `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.

To be precise, let's pick the case where there are trailing spaces, to show the effect of rstrip.

So:
- `text`: `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.   "`
- `chars`: `""`
