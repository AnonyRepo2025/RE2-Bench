[THOUGHT]
The function get_variance returns the variance of the data array, rounded to 2 decimal places. The output is 1.25.

Let’s recall that variance is the mean of the squared differences from the mean:
Var = mean((x_i - mean(x))^2)

Let’s try to find a small set of numbers whose variance is 1.25.

Let’s try [1, 2, 3, 4]:
mean = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5
squared differences: (1-2.5)^2 = 2.25, (2-2.5)^2 = 0.25, (3-2.5)^2 = 0.25, (4-2.5)^2 = 2.25
sum = 5
mean = 5/4 = 1.25

So, if data = [1,2,3,4], np.var([1,2,3,4]) = 1.25

Therefore, the input data is [1,2,3,4].
