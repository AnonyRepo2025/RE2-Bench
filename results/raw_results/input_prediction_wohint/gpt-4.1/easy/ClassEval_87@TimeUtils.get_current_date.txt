[THOUGHT]
The function get_current_date is a method of the TimeUtils class. It uses self.datetime, which is set in the constructor to a specific datetime.datetime value (by default, datetime.datetime.now() at the time of object creation). The method then formats this datetime as a string in the format '%Y-%m-%d'.

Given the output "2025-08-25", this means that self.datetime must be a datetime.datetime object representing August 25, 2025 (the time part is irrelevant since only the date is formatted).

The method get_current_date takes no arguments (other than self), so the only input to specify is the value of self, specifically self.datetime.

Therefore, the input should be:
- self: an instance of TimeUtils, with self.datetime = datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 25, ...)

The args and kwargs are empty, since get_current_date takes no parameters.
