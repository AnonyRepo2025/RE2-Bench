[THOUGHT]
The function read_file_as_json reads a file at self.file_path and loads its contents as JSON, returning the result. The output is 12345, which means the file at file_path must contain the JSON literal 12345 (i.e., the file's contents are just 12345, not a string, not an object).

The only input to the function is self, which must have file_path set to the path of a file containing the JSON literal 12345. There are no args or kwargs.

So, the input is:
- self: {"file_path": <some path to a file containing 12345>}

Since the file path is arbitrary, but must point to such a file, let's use "test.json" as a placeholder.
