[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes a list `lst`.
2. The first operation is `lst.clear()`, which empties the list in-place. After this, `lst` is always `[]`, regardless of its original contents.
3. The next line is a for loop: `for i in lst:`. Since `lst` is now empty, this loop will not execute at all.
4. The `else` block of the for loop will execute if the loop completes without a `return` (which is always the case here, since the loop never runs).
5. The `else` block returns `True`.

Therefore, no matter what the original contents of `lst` are, the function will always return `True` because the list is cleared before the loop, making the loop body unreachable.

Thus, any input list will result in `True` as output.
