[THOUGHT]
The function _validate_phoneNumber takes a string phoneNumber and returns:
- None if phoneNumber is falsy (empty string, None, etc.)
- None if the length is not 11 or if it contains non-digit characters.
- Otherwise, returns the phoneNumber string.

The output is null (i.e., None in Python). This can happen in three cases:
1. phoneNumber is falsy (e.g., "")
2. phoneNumber is not 11 characters long (e.g., "123", "123456789012")
3. phoneNumber contains non-digit characters (e.g., "1234567890a", "abcdefghijk")

Any of these would result in None. Since the function is called directly, the input is just the phoneNumber string. For example, "" (empty string), "123", or "1234567890a" would all return None.

Let's pick one concrete example: "1234567890a" (11 characters, but contains a non-digit).
