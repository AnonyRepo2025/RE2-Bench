[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

```python
def f(nums, index):
    return nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2
```

- `nums[index] % 42` is computed first.
- Then, `nums.pop(index)` removes and returns the element at `index` from `nums`, and multiplies it by 2.
- The sum of the two is returned.

Note: `nums[index]` and `nums.pop(index)` will refer to the same value, since `nums[index]` is evaluated before the pop.

Let the value at `nums[index]` be `x`. Then the function returns: `x % 42 + x * 2 = 2x + (x % 42)`

We are told the output is 9.

So:
2x + (x % 42) = 9

Letâ€™s try small integer values for x:

Try x = 3:
2*3 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9

So x = 3 works.

Now, what about nums and index? The function will mutate nums by popping index, but the input is just the initial nums and index.

So, for example, nums could be [3], index=0.

Alternatively, nums could be [a, 3, b], index=1, etc.

But the simplest is nums = [3], index = 0.

Alternatively, nums = [3, ...], index = 0.

But since the function only uses nums[index], and pops it, the rest of the list is not used.

So, the minimal input is nums = [3], index = 0.
