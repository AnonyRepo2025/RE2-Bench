[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function:

- The function takes a list `lst`.
- It iterates over the indices from 1 to len(lst)-1, stepping by 2 (i.e., all odd indices).
- For each such index `i`, if `lst[i]` is even, it includes `lst[i]` in the sum.
- The function returns the sum of all such even elements at odd indices.

We need to find a list `lst` such that the sum of all even numbers at odd indices is 12.

Let's try to construct such a list step by step.

Let’s denote the elements at odd indices as: lst[1], lst[3], lst[5], ...

Suppose we pick:
- lst[1] = 2 (even)
- lst[3] = 4 (even)
- lst[5] = 6 (even)

Sum: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12

So, if we have a list with at least 6 elements, and at indices 1, 3, 5 we have 2, 4, 6 (all even), the sum will be 12.

The other elements (at even indices) can be anything, say 0.

So, one possible list is: [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 6]

Let’s check:
- Odd indices: 1, 3, 5
- lst[1] = 2 (even)
- lst[3] = 4 (even)
- lst[5] = 6 (even)
Sum = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12

This matches the output.

Alternatively, we could have more elements, or some odd numbers at odd indices (which would be skipped), but the above is the simplest.

Therefore, the input is:
lst = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 6]
