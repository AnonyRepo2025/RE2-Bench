[THOUGHT]
The function sign_in checks if the username exists in self.users. If not, it returns False. If it does exist, it sets self.users[username] = True and returns True. Since the output is true, the username must already be in self.users before calling sign_in. The value associated with the username does not matter (could be False or True), as the function will set it to True anyway. The input must be a username that is already present in self.users. The value of self.users before the call must include the username as a key. The username argument can be any string, but it must match a key in self.users.
