[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes a single argument `nums`, which is expected to be a list.
2. It creates two lists:
   - `asc` is a copy of `nums`.
   - `desc` is an empty list.
3. It reverses `asc`.
4. It sets `desc` to be the first half of `asc` (using integer division for the length).
5. It returns `desc + asc + desc`.

We are told that the output is an empty list: `[]`.

Let's consider what input could produce this.

Case 1: `nums` is an empty list (`[]`).
- `asc = [].copy()` → `[]`
- `desc = []`
- `asc.reverse()` → still `[]`
- `desc = asc[:len(asc)//2]` → `[][:0]` → `[]`
- Return: `[] + [] + []` → `[]`

Case 2: `nums` is not empty.
- Let's try with one element: `[x]`
  - `asc = [x]`
  - `desc = []`
  - `asc.reverse()` → `[x]`
  - `desc = [x][:0]` → `[]`
  - Return: `[] + [x] + []` → `[x]` (not empty)

So, only when `nums` is empty will the output be `[]`.

Therefore, the input must be `nums = []`.
