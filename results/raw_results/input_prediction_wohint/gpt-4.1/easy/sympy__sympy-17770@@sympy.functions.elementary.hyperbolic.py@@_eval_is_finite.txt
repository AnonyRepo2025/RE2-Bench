[THOUGHT]
The function `_eval_is_finite` is a method of the `sinh` class, which inherits from `HyperbolicFunction`. The method takes `self` as its only argument. It accesses `self.args[0]` and returns `arg.is_finite`.

The output is `true`, which means that `arg.is_finite` must be `True`.

Therefore, the input must be an instance of `sinh` whose first argument (`self.args[0]`) is an object with the attribute `is_finite` set to `True`.

In SymPy, most atomic expressions (like numbers, symbols with no assumptions, etc.) have `is_finite` as `True` or `None`. To guarantee `True`, the simplest is to use a number, e.g., `0`, `1`, or any finite number.

So, the input is: `self` is a `sinh` object with `args = (finite_expr,)`, where `finite_expr.is_finite == True`. For example, `sinh(1)`.
