[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The input is split into two parts: `a` and `b`.
2. `b` is modified: `b = b[0] + b[2:]` (take the first character, then skip the second character, and take the rest).
3. Both `a` and `b` are converted to integers.
4. The output is `a * b // 100`.

The output is 0, so `a * b // 100 == 0`. This means that either `a == 0`, or `b == 0`, or `a * b < 100`.

Let's try some small values.

Suppose `a = 1`. Then `b` must be less than 100 for the integer division to be 0.

But let's also consider the transformation of `b`. Suppose the input is `1 23`:
- `a = '1'`
- `b = '23'`
- `b = b[0] + b[2:]` → `b[0] = '2'`, `b[2:]` = '' (since '23' has only two characters), so `b = '2'`
- `a = 1`, `b = 2`
- `1 * 2 // 100 = 0`

So, input: `"1 23"` produces output 0.

Let's check another example to be sure.

Suppose input is `"0 99"`:
- `a = '0'`
- `b = '99'`
- `b = b[0] + b[2:]` → `b[0] = '9'`, `b[2:]` = '' → `b = '9'`
- `a = 0`, `b = 9`
- `0 * 9 // 100 = 0`

So, this also works.

But the simplest, most canonical answer is `"1 23"`.
