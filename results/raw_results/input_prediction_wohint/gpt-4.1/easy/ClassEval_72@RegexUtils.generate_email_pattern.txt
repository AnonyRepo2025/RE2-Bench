[THOUGHT]
The function generate_email_pattern is a method of the RegexUtils class. It does not take any arguments (other than self), and simply returns a hardcoded regex pattern string for matching email addresses. The output matches exactly the string returned in the function. Therefore, the input must be an instance of RegexUtils, and no additional arguments are passed.
