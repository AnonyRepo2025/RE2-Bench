[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes a single argument `text`.
2. It finds the index of the first occurrence of the character `'8'` in `text` using `text.find('8')`.
   - If `'8'` is not found, `.find()` returns -1.
   - If `'8'` is found at position n, it returns n (0-based index).
3. It converts this index to an integer (which is redundant since `.find()` already returns an int).
4. It returns `'x0' * n`, i.e., the string `'x0'` repeated n times.

Given the output is `"x0x0"`, that means `'x0'` is repeated 2 times, so `n = 2`.

Therefore, `text.find('8')` must return 2, which means the first occurrence of `'8'` is at index 2 in `text`.

So, `text` must be a string where the character at index 2 is `'8'`, and there is no `'8'` before that.

For example:
- If `text = "ab8..."`, then index 0 is 'a', index 1 is 'b', index 2 is '8'.

So, a minimal input is `"ab8"`, but it could be longer, as long as the first '8' is at index 2.

Thus, the input should be:
```
{
    "text": "ab8"
}
```
