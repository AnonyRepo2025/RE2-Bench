[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer N from input. If N is even (N % 2 == 0), it prints 0.5. Otherwise, it prints (N + 1) / N / 2.

The output is 0.5. This can happen in two ways:
1. N is even, so the code prints 0.5 directly.
2. N is odd, but (N + 1) / N / 2 == 0.5.

Let's check the second case:
(N + 1) / N / 2 = 0.5
=> (N + 1) / N = 1
=> N + 1 = N
=> 1 = 0, which is impossible.

So, the only way to get 0.5 is if N is even.

Therefore, any even integer input will produce this output. The simplest even integer is 2.

Let's check:
N = 2
N % 2 == 0 â†’ print(0.5)

So, input should be 2 (or any even integer).
