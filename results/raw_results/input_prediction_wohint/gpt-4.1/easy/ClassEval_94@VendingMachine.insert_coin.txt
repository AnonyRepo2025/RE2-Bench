[THOUGHT]
The function `insert_coin` adds the given `amount` to the current `balance` and returns the new balance. The initial balance is 0 (from `__init__`). Since the output is 6.25, this must be the first call to `insert_coin` after initialization, and the amount inserted must be 6.25. The only input parameter is `amount`, and `self` is an instance of `VendingMachine` with `balance` 0 and empty `inventory`.
