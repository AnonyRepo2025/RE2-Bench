[THOUGHT]
The function remove_employee checks if the given employee_id exists in self.employees. If it does, it deletes the entry and returns True. If not, it returns False. The output is false, so the employee_id provided was not in self.employees. Since self.employees is an instance variable, its contents are determined by the state of the object. For this output, the input must be an employee_id that is not present in self.employees. The value of employee_id can be any value not in the dictionary. Since the function only takes employee_id as an argument, and self is the instance, the input should be self (with any employees dict, but must not contain the id) and employee_id (not present in self.employees).
