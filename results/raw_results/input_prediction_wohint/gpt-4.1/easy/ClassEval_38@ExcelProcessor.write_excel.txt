[THOUGHT]
The function write_excel takes two arguments: data (a list of rows to write to an Excel file) and file_name (the name of the file to write to). It tries to create a new Excel workbook, append each row from data to the active sheet, save the workbook to file_name, and close it. If everything succeeds, it returns 1; if any exception occurs, it returns 0.

The output is 1, which means the function executed successfully: the data was written to the file without errors. There are no constraints on what the data or file_name must be, except that they must be valid for openpyxl to process (i.e., data is a list of lists/tuples, file_name is a valid string filename).

Since the output is 1, the minimal valid input would be a small data list (e.g., [[1,2,3]]) and a valid file name (e.g., "test.xlsx"). The actual content of data and file_name is not specified by the output, only that they are valid.

So, a possible input is:
- data: [[1, 2, 3]]
- file_name: "test.xlsx"
