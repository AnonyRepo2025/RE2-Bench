[THOUGHT]
The function insert_into_database inserts a list of dictionaries (with keys 'name' and 'age') into a table in an SQLite database. The function does not return anything (hence output: null).

To call this method, we need:
- self: an instance of DatabaseProcessor, which requires a database_name (string, e.g., "mydb.sqlite").
- args: table_name (string, e.g., "people") and data (list of dicts with 'name' and 'age' keys).
- kwargs: none.

Since the output is always null (the function returns nothing), the output does not give us information about the specific input values. However, the function requires:
- table_name: a string (e.g., "people")
- data: a list of dicts, each with 'name' (string) and 'age' (int).

A plausible input would be:
self: { "database_name": "mydb.sqlite" }
args: { "table_name": "people", "data": [{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}] }
kwargs: {}

This matches the function signature and requirements.
