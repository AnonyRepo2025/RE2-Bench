[THOUGHT]
The function set_target_temperature sets the instance's target_temperature to the provided temperature. It does not return anything (hence output: null). The only input to this function is the temperature argument. There is no output, so any value for temperature is possible as long as it is a valid input.

Since the function is a method, the input will include the self object (with its current state) and the temperature argument. However, since the output is always null, the only thing we can infer is that temperature was set to some value. There is no way to deduce the exact value of temperature from the output alone, so we can pick a plausible example, such as 22.
