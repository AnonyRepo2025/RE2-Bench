[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. `result_list = ['3', '3', '3', '3']`  
   This creates a list with four elements, all being the string '3'.

2. `if result_list:`  
   This checks if the list is non-empty, which it is, so the next line executes.

3. `result_list.clear()`  
   This empties the list. However, this has no effect on the return value.

4. `return len(text)`  
   The function returns the length of the input string `text`.

Given the output is 5, that means `len(text) == 5`.  
So, the input must be a string of length 5. The actual content of the string does not matter, as only its length is used.

Therefore, the input could be any string of length 5, such as "abcde".
