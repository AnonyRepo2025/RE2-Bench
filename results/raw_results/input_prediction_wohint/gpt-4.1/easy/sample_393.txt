[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

1. The function takes a string `text`.
2. It reverses the string: `ls = text[::-1]`.
3. It initializes `text2` as an empty string.
4. It loops: `for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3):`
   - For each `i`, it takes a slice `ls[i:i+3]`, joins its characters with '---', and appends '---' at the end.
   - After the loop, it returns `text2[:-3]` (removes the last '---').

Given the output is `"a---c---s"`.

Let's try to reconstruct the process backwards.

First, the output is `"a---c---s"`. This is the result of joining three characters with '---' in between.

So, the function must have, in one iteration, joined three characters: 'a', 'c', 's'.

But the function does this in a loop, possibly multiple times, but the output only has one group.

Let's see what values of `ls` and `i` would produce this.

Let’s try to reverse engineer:

- The output is `"a---c---s"`, which is the result of `'---'.join(['a','c','s'])`.

So, in the loop, for some `i`, `ls[i:i+3]` is `['a','c','s']`.

Now, the loop is: `for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3):`

Let’s try with a string of length 6:

- len(ls) = 6
- range(3, 0, -3) → i = 3

So, only one iteration with i=3.

ls[3:6] = ?

Let’s try with a string "scabcx" (just as a test):

But let's try to reconstruct the original string.

Let’s denote the reversed string as ls = [l0, l1, l2, l3, l4, l5]

At i=3, ls[3:6] = [l3, l4, l5]

So, the output is '---'.join([l3, l4, l5]) + '---'

But after the loop, we do text2[:-3], so the last '---' is removed.

So, the output is '---'.join([l3, l4, l5])

And this is 'a---c---s'

So, l3 = 'a', l4 = 'c', l5 = 's'

So, ls = [l0, l1, l2, l3, l4, l5]

Now, what is the value of l0, l1, l2? The loop only runs for i=3, so nothing is appended for i=0.

So, the original string must be of length 6.

Now, ls = text[::-1], so text = ls[::-1]

Let’s assign l3 = 'a', l4 = 'c', l5 = 's'

Let’s try to find l0, l1, l2.

Let’s try with arbitrary values, say l0='x', l1='y', l2='z'

So, ls = ['x', 'y', 'z', 'a', 'c', 's']

So, text = ls[::-1] = ['s', 'c', 'a', 'z', 'y', 'x'] → "scazyx"

Now, let's check the function with text = "scazyx":

- ls = "xyzacs"
- len(ls) = 6
- range(3, 0, -3): i=3
- ls[3:6] = ['a', 'c', 's']
- '---'.join(['a','c','s']) + '---' → "a---c---s---"
- text2 = "a---c---s---"
- After loop, return text2[:-3] → "a---c---s"

This matches the output.

Therefore, one possible input is "scazyx".

But the first three characters (l0, l1, l2) can be any characters.

So, any string whose last three characters (when reversed) are 'a', 'c', 's' will work.

But the function only produces output for strings of length 6, because for longer strings, the loop would run more than once, and the output would have more groups.

So, the input is any 6-character string whose last three characters (when reversed) are 'a', 'c', 's'.

So, the input is any string whose first three characters are 's', 'c', 'a', and the last three can be anything.

So, "scaxyz" is one possible input.

But in our example above, "scazyx" works.

Therefore, the input is "scazyx" (or any string of length 6 starting with "sca").
