[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function:

```python
def f(array, elem):
    array.extend(elem)
    return array
```

- `array.extend(elem)` will take each element from `elem` and append it to `array` (in-place).
- The function then returns the modified `array`.

Now, the output is:
```
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [1, 2],
    1,
    [1, 2, 3],
    3,
    [2, 1]
]
```

This is a list of 6 elements. The first two are lists, the third is an int, the fourth is a list, the fifth is an int, the sixth is a list.

But the function only returns `array`, which is a single list. So the output must be a single list, and this is the list returned.

That means, after `array.extend(elem)`, `array` is:
```
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [1, 2],
    1,
    [1, 2, 3],
    3,
    [2, 1]
]
```

So, what could have been the original `array` and `elem`?

Recall that `array.extend(elem)` will append each element of `elem` to `array`.

Let `array = A`, `elem = B`.

So, after `A.extend(B)`, `A` is the concatenation of the original `A` and the elements of `B`.

Let the output be `O`:
```
O = A + list(B)
```

So, we need to split the output into two parts: the original `array` and the elements that were added.

But since `extend` is used, `elem` must be an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, etc.), and its elements are appended to `array`.

Let’s try to find a split of the output list into two parts: the prefix is the original `array`, and the suffix is the elements of `elem`.

Let’s try all possible splits:

Try split at 0:
- array = []
- elem = [[1,2,3],[1,2],1,[1,2,3],3,[2,1]]

Try split at 1:
- array = [[1,2,3]]
- elem = [[1,2],[1],[1,2,3],3,[2,1]]

But elem must be an iterable, and the function will do array.extend(elem), so the elements of elem will be appended to array.

But the output is:
[
    [1, 2, 3],   # 0
    [1, 2],      # 1
    1,           # 2
    [1, 2, 3],   # 3
    3,           # 4
    [2, 1]       # 5
]

Suppose the original array is empty, and elem is the whole list. That would work, but let's see if that's the only solution.

But the function modifies array in-place, so if array is empty, the result is just list(elem).

But the output contains both lists and ints, so elem can be a list of mixed types.

So, possible input:
- array = []
- elem = [[1,2,3],[1,2],1,[1,2,3],3,[2,1]]

Alternatively, maybe array is [1,2,3], and elem is [[1,2],[1],[1,2,3],3,[2,1]], but then the output would be [1,2,3,[1,2],[1],[1,2,3],3,[2,1]], which does not match.

So, the only way for the output to be as given is if array is empty, and elem is the output list.

But let's check: if array = [], elem = [[1,2,3],[1,2],1,[1,2,3],3,[2,1]], then after array.extend(elem), array is [[1,2,3],[1,2],1,[1,2,3],3,[2,1]], which matches the output.

Therefore, the input is:
- array: []
- elem: [[1,2,3],[1,2],1,[1,2,3],3,[2,1]]
