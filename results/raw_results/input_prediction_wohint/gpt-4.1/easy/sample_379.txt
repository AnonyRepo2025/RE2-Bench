Let's analyze the function step by step.

The function f takes a list nums.

It iterates over the indices of nums in reverse, starting from the last index, going down by 3 each time (i.e., i = len(nums)-1, len(nums)-4, ...), until i >= 0.

At each step, it checks if nums[i] == 0. If so, it clears the list (nums.clear()) and returns False.

If the loop completes without finding a 0 at any of the checked indices, it returns nums.

Given the output is false, that means the function hit the if condition and returned False.

That only happens if, for some i in the range(len(nums)-1, -1, -3), nums[i] == 0.

Let's construct a minimal example.

Suppose nums = [a, b, c, d]. len(nums) = 4.

Indices checked: i = 3, 0 (since range(3, -1, -3) gives 3, 0).

So, if nums[3] == 0 or nums[0] == 0, the function returns False.

So, for output False, nums must have 0 at one of those indices.

Let's try nums = [1, 2, 3, 0]. Then len(nums) = 4, indices checked: 3, 0.

nums[3] == 0, so the function will clear nums and return False.

Alternatively, nums = [0, 2, 3, 4]. Indices checked: 3, 0. nums[0] == 0, so again, returns False.

So, any list where the last or first element (for length 4) is 0.

For a more general case, let's try length 5: nums = [a, b, c, d, e], len(nums) = 5.

Indices checked: 4, 1.

So, if nums[4] == 0 or nums[1] == 0, returns False.

So, the pattern is: for a list of length n, the indices checked are n-1, n-4, n-7, ..., as long as >= 0.

So, to get output False, we need a list where at least one of those indices is 0.

Let's pick a simple example: [1, 2, 3, 0] (so that the last element is 0).

Therefore, the input is nums = [1, 2, 3, 0].
