[THOUGHT]
The function mean computes the average of the input list, rounded to two decimal places. The output is 4.17. Let's denote the input list as data.

Let’s reverse engineer possible values:
Let n = length of data.
mean = round(sum(data)/n, 2) = 4.17

Let’s try n=6:
sum(data)/6 = 4.17 → sum(data) = 25.02
But sum must be a sum of integers or floats. 25.02 is not a typical sum for integers.

Try n=12:
sum(data) = 4.17*12 = 50.04

Try n=24:
sum(data) = 4.17*24 = 100.08

Try n=3:
sum(data) = 4.17*3 = 12.51

Try n=4:
sum(data) = 4.17*4 = 16.68

Try n=6, but with possible float values.

Alternatively, maybe the input is [4, 4, 5], sum=13, mean=4.333..., round(4.33,2)=4.33

Try [4, 4, 4, 5]: sum=17, mean=4.25

Try [4, 4, 5, 4]: sum=17, mean=4.25

Try [4, 4, 5, 4, 4]: sum=21, mean=4.2

Try [4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4]: sum=25, mean=4.166..., round(4.166...,2)=4.17

So, [4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4] is a possible input.

Check: sum=4+4+5+4+4+4=25, mean=25/6=4.166666..., round(4.166666...,2)=4.17

Therefore, the input could be [4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4].
