[THOUGHT]
The function `truncate_number` takes a float `number` and returns `number % 1.0`. The modulo operation with 1.0 returns the fractional part of the number. For example, `2.5 % 1.0` is `0.5`, `3.7 % 1.0` is `0.7`, and so on.

Given that the output is `0.5`, we need to find a `number` such that `number % 1.0 == 0.5`. This means that `number` is any number whose fractional part is `0.5`, such as `0.5`, `1.5`, `2.5`, `-0.5` (since `-0.5 % 1.0 == 0.5` in Python), etc.

Any of these values would work, but the simplest is `0.5`.
