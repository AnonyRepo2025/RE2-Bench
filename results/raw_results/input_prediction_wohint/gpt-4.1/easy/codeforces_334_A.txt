[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code:

- The code reads an integer n.
- It sets i = 1 and j = n * n.
- While i < j, it prints i and j, then increments i and decrements j.

Let's look at the output:

- The first line is "1 100", the second is "2 99", ..., the last is "50 51".
- Let's count the number of lines: from 1 100 to 50 51, that's 50 lines.

Let's check what value of n gives j = 100:
- j = n * n = 100 â†’ n = 10.

Now, let's check the loop:
- i starts at 1, j at 100.
- Each iteration: i increases by 1, j decreases by 1.
- The loop continues while i < j.

Let's see when i = 50, j = 51:
- After 49 increments, i = 50, j = 51.
- Next iteration: i = 51, j = 50, so i < j is false, loop ends.

So, for n = 10, the output matches exactly.

Therefore, the input is 10.
