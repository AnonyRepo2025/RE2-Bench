[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes a list `nums`.
2. The first operation is `nums.clear()`, which empties the list in-place.
3. Then, it tries to iterate over `nums` (which is now empty) and for each `num`, appends `num * 2` to `nums`.
4. Finally, it returns `nums`.

No matter what the original contents of `nums` are, after `nums.clear()`, the list is empty. The for loop will not execute because `nums` is empty at that point. Therefore, the function will always return an empty list, regardless of the input.

Given the output is `[]`, the input could be any list (including an empty list). The minimal input is an empty list.
