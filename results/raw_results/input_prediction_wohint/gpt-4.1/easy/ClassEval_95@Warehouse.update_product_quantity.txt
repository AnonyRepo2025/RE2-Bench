[THOUGHT]
The function update_product_quantity takes two arguments: product_id and quantity. It checks if product_id is in self.inventory, and if so, it adds quantity to self.inventory[product_id]['quantity']. The function does not return anything, so the output is always null (None in Python).

Given only the output (null), we cannot deduce the exact values of product_id and quantity, but we know that the function was called, and the output is always null regardless of input. However, to call this method, we need to provide a self (an instance of Warehouse), and the two arguments.

Since the function only updates if product_id is in self.inventory, but the output does not depend on whether the update happened or not (since it always returns None), any values for product_id and quantity are possible.

But to be concrete, let's assume a typical case: the inventory has a product with id "A123" and we add 10 units.

So, self.inventory = {"A123": {"quantity": 5}}, product_id = "A123", quantity = 10.

The input should reflect this.
