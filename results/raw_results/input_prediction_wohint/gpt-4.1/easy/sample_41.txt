[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

1. The function takes two arguments: `array` and `values`.
2. It reverses `array`.
3. For each `value` in `values`, it inserts `value` at the middle index of `array` (using integer division).
4. It reverses `array` again.
5. Returns `array`.

We are told the final output is `[58, 92, 21]`.

Let us denote the original input as `array_in` and `values_in`.

Let us try to reverse-engineer the process.

Let the final output be `result = [58, 92, 21]`.

Since the last step is `array.reverse()`, the array before the last reverse was `[21, 92, 58]`.

So, after all insertions, but before the final reverse, the array was `[21, 92, 58]`.

Let us try to reconstruct the process backwards.

Let us denote the state after each step:

Let us call the array after the first reverse as `A`.

We start with `A`, and for each value in `values`, we insert it at the middle.

Let us try to simulate the process forward, starting with a guess for `array` and `values`.

Let us try with `values` as an empty list. If `values` is empty, then the function just reverses the array twice, so the output is the same as the input. But the output is `[58, 92, 21]`, so the input would have to be `[58, 92, 21]`.

But let's check what happens if `values` is not empty.

Suppose `values` has one element. Let's try to reconstruct the process.

Let us try with `array = [a, b]` and `values = [c]`.

- array.reverse() -> [b, a]
- insert c at len(array)//2 = 1: [b, c, a]
- array.reverse() -> [a, c, b]

So, if the output is `[58, 92, 21]`, then before the final reverse it was `[21, 92, 58]`.

Suppose we had `array = [x, y]` and `values = [z]`.

- array.reverse() -> [y, x]
- insert z at 1: [y, z, x]
- array.reverse() -> [x, z, y]

So, for output `[58, 92, 21]`, this would require `[x, z, y] = [58, 92, 21]`, so x=58, z=92, y=21.

So, the input array was [21, 58], values = [92].

Let's check:

- array = [21, 58]
- reverse: [58, 21]
- insert 92 at 1: [58, 92, 21]
- reverse: [21, 92, 58]

But the output is `[58, 92, 21]`, not `[21, 92, 58]`.

Wait, but the output is `[58, 92, 21]`, so after the final reverse, the array is `[58, 92, 21]`.

So before the final reverse, it was `[21, 92, 58]`.

So, let's try to reconstruct the process backwards.

Suppose the last value inserted was v2, and before that, the array was A1.

After inserting v2 at the middle, we get `[21, 92, 58]`.

Suppose `values` has two elements.

Let us try with `array = [a]`, `values = [b, c]`.

- array.reverse() -> [a]
- insert b at 0: [b, a]
- insert c at 1: [b, c, a]
- array.reverse() -> [a, c, b]

So, if output is `[58, 92, 21]`, then [a, c, b] = [58, 92, 21], so a=58, c=92, b=21.

So, input array = [58], values = [21, 92].

Let's check:

- array = [58]
- reverse: [58]
- insert 21 at 0: [21, 58]
- insert 92 at 1: [21, 92, 58]
- reverse: [58, 92, 21]

Yes! This matches the output.

Therefore, the input is:

array = [58]
values = [21, 92]
