[THOUGHT]
The function `triangle_area(a, h)` computes the area of a triangle using the formula: area = (a * h) / 2.0, where `a` is the base and `h` is the height.

We are told the output is 40.0.

So:
a * h / 2.0 = 40.0
=> a * h = 80.0

There are infinitely many (a, h) pairs that satisfy this equation. The most likely scenario is that both `a` and `h` are integers or simple floats.

Some possible pairs:
- a = 8, h = 10: 8 * 10 = 80
- a = 10, h = 8: 10 * 8 = 80
- a = 20, h = 4: 20 * 4 = 80
- a = 16, h = 5: 16 * 5 = 80

Any of these would work. The most "default" triangle is often with base 8 and height 10.

So, likely input: a = 8, h = 10.
