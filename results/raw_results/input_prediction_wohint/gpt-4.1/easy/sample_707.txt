[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

1. The function takes `text` and `position`.
2. It calculates `length = len(text)`.
3. It calculates `index = position % (length + 1)`.
4. If `position < 0 or index < 0`, then `index = -1`.
5. It converts `text` to a list, pops the character at `index`, and returns the joined string.

We are told the output is "udbs l".

Let's try to reverse engineer the input.

First, the output is "udbs l", which is 6 characters long. That means the original text was 7 characters long.

Let the original text be "abcdefg" (just as a placeholder). But let's try to find a text where removing one character gives "udbs l".

Let's try to find the missing character and its position.

Suppose the original text is "udbs lX", and after removing one character, we get "udbs l".

Let's try all possible positions:

- Remove 0: "dbs lX"
- Remove 1: "ubs lX"
- Remove 2: "uds lX"
- Remove 3: "udb lX"
- Remove 4: "udbs X"
- Remove 5: "udbs l"
- Remove 6: "udbs l"

So, if the original text is "udbs lX", and we remove index 5 or 6, we get "udbs l".

But the function uses `index = position % (length + 1)`, and then pops at that index.

Letâ€™s try with text = "udbs lX" (length = 7).

If position = 5, index = 5 % 8 = 5. Remove index 5: "udbs lX" -> "udbs l".

If position = 6, index = 6 % 8 = 6. Remove index 6: "udbs lX" -> "udbs l".

If position = 7, index = 7 % 8 = 7. Remove index 7: "udbs lX" -> "udbs l".

But if we remove index 5, we get "udbs lX" -> "udbs X".

But the output is "udbs l", so the original text must be "udbs lX", and the character at index 6 (the last character) is removed.

So, index = 6.

Given length = 7, index = position % 8 = 6, so position could be 6, 14, 22, etc.

Let's pick position = 6.

So, input: text = "udbs lX", position = 6.

Alternatively, let's check if there are other possible texts.

Suppose the original text is "udbs xl", and we remove index 5: "udbs xl" -> "udbs l".

But "udbs xl" with length 7, index = 5, so position = 5, 13, etc.

But the output is "udbs l", so the original text is "udbs lX", and position = 6.

Therefore, the input is:

text: "udbs lX"
position: 6
