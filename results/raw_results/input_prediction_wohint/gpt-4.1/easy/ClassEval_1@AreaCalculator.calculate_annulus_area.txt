The function calculate_annulus_area computes the area of an annulus (ring) using the formula: π * (outer_radius^2 - inner_radius^2).

We are told the output is 3.141592653589793, which is the value of π to high precision.

So:
π * (outer_radius^2 - inner_radius^2) = π

Divide both sides by π:
outer_radius^2 - inner_radius^2 = 1

So, the difference of the squares of the radii is 1.

Possible integer values:
If inner_radius = 0, outer_radius = 1 (1^2 - 0^2 = 1)
If inner_radius = any value x, outer_radius = sqrt(x^2 + 1)

But the simplest is inner_radius = 0, outer_radius = 1.

The self.radius is not used in this method, but it would be present in the input.

So, the input should be:
self: { "radius": ... } (any value, say 0)
args: { "inner_radius": 0, "outer_radius": 1 }
