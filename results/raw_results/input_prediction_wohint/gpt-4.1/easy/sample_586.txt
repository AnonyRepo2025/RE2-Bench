[THOUGHT]
The function f takes two arguments: text (a string) and char (a character). It returns the highest index in text where char occurs, using the rindex method.

Given the output is 2, this means that text.rindex(char) == 2. That is, the last occurrence of char in text is at index 2.

Let's consider possible values:
- If text = "aba", and char = "a", then "a" occurs at index 0 and 2, so rindex("a") == 2.
- If text = "cac", and char = "c", then "c" occurs at index 0 and 2, so rindex("c") == 2.
- If text = "abc", and char = "c", then "c" occurs at index 2, so rindex("c") == 2.

So, any string where char occurs at index 2 (and possibly earlier) will work.

Let's pick a simple example: text = "aba", char = "a".

f("aba", "a") returns 2.

So the input is:
{
    "text": "aba",
    "char": "a"
}
