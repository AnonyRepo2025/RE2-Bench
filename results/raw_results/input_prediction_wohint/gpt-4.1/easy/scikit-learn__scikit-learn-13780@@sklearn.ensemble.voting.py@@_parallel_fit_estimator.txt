[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the problem:

1. The function in question is `_parallel_fit_estimator(estimator, X, y, sample_weight=None)`. It fits the estimator (which must have a `.fit()` method) to the data (X, y), possibly with sample weights.

2. The output is a set of attributes from a fitted sklearn `LogisticRegression` estimator:
   - penalty: "l2"
   - dual: false
   - tol: 0.0001
   - C: 1.0
   - fit_intercept: true
   - intercept_scaling: 1
   - class_weight: null
   - random_state: 123
   - solver: "warn"
   - max_iter: 100
   - multi_class: "warn"
   - verbose: 0
   - warm_start: false
   - n_jobs: null
   - l1_ratio: null
   - classes_: [0 1 2]
   - coef_: [[ 1.93489892 -2.3377872 ] [-1.14141618  0.25039978] [-2.48838333  2.00019439]]
   - intercept_: [ 0.42495247  1.68620893 -2.47869225]
   - n_iter_: [7]

3. The function returns the estimator after fitting. The output is the state of the estimator after fitting.

4. To reconstruct the input, we need:
   - The estimator: a LogisticRegression instance with the above parameters.
   - X, y: the data that, when fit, produces the above classes_, coef_, intercept_, n_iter_.
   - sample_weight: None (since not present in output).

5. Let's focus on the estimator:
   - The parameters match the default LogisticRegression except for random_state=123, solver="warn", multi_class="warn".
   - The output classes_ is [0 1 2], so y must have three classes: 0, 1, 2.
   - The coef_ is a 3x2 array, so X must have 2 features, and y must have 3 classes.
   - n_iter_ is [7], which is typical for a small dataset.

6. Let's try to reconstruct a minimal X, y that would produce 3 classes and 2 features.
   - For sklearn, a classic toy dataset for 3-class, 2-feature is the iris dataset (first two features).
   - But the actual coefficients and intercepts are not the same as iris, but that's OK: we just need a plausible X, y.

7. Since the output is not about the data, but about the estimator's state, and the function only fits the estimator, any X, y with 3 classes and 2 features would work.

8. sample_weight is None.

9. The estimator must be a LogisticRegression instance with the given parameters.

10. The input should be:
    - estimator: LogisticRegression(penalty="l2", dual=False, tol=0.0001, C=1.0, fit_intercept=True, intercept_scaling=1, class_weight=None, random_state=123, solver="warn", max_iter=100, multi_class="warn", verbose=0, warm_start=False, n_jobs=None, l1_ratio=None)
    - X: array of shape (n_samples, 2)
    - y: array of shape (n_samples,), with values 0, 1, 2
    - sample_weight: None

11. For completeness, let's use a small toy dataset:
    X = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
    y = [0,1,2,0,1,2]

12. The input should be a JSON with keys: estimator, X, y, sample_weight.

13. Since estimator is a class instance, in JSON we can represent it as a dict with its parameters.

14. X and y as lists.

15. sample_weight as null.
