The function list_employees is a method of the HRManagementSystem class. It returns a dictionary of employees, where each key is the employee_id and the value is a dictionary of employee details, including the employee_ID (which is just the id), and all other info from the employees dictionary.

Given the output:
{
    "1": {
        "employee_ID": 1,
        "name": "John",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 100000
    }
}

This means that self.employees must have a single entry with key 1, and value being a dictionary with keys: name, position, department, salary. The function then copies these into the output, and adds employee_ID: 1.

There are no arguments or kwargs for list_employees.

So, the input is:
self: an HRManagementSystem instance with self.employees = {1: {"name": "John", "position": "Manager", "department": "Sales", "salary": 100000}}
args: {}
kwargs: {}
