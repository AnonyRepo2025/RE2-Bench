The function `f` takes two arguments, `arr1` and `arr2`. It creates a copy of `arr1` called `new_arr`, then extends `new_arr` with the elements of `arr2`, and returns `new_arr`.

The output is a single list:
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]

This means that `arr1` and `arr2` were concatenated in this order. The first part of the list comes from `arr1`, and the second part comes from `arr2`.

We need to determine a possible split of this list into two lists, such that when `arr1` is copied and extended with `arr2`, we get the output.

Since the function does not modify the elements, any split is valid as long as their concatenation gives the output.

A common convention is to assume `arr1` is the prefix and `arr2` is the suffix. Let's try all possible splits:

- arr1 = [], arr2 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]
- arr1 = [5], arr2 = [1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]
- arr1 = [5, 1], arr2 = [3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]
- arr1 = [5, 1, 3], arr2 = [7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]
- arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7], arr2 = [8, "", 0, -1, []]
- arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], arr2 = ["", 0, -1, []]
- arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, ""], arr2 = [0, -1, []]
- arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0], arr2 = [-1, []]
- arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1], arr2 = [[]]
- arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []], arr2 = []

Any of these splits would work, but the most likely is that arr1 and arr2 are both non-empty and the split is somewhere in the middle.

But since the function is so simple, and unless otherwise specified, the most straightforward split is to divide the list into two roughly equal parts.

Let's pick arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], arr2 = ["", 0, -1, []].

When we run f([5, 1, 3, 7, 8], ["", 0, -1, []]), we get:
- new_arr = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8]
- new_arr.extend(["", 0, -1, []]) => [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]

Which matches the output.

Therefore, the input is:
arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8]
arr2 = ["", 0, -1, []]
