[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a string `text` and reverses it by iterating from the last character to the first and concatenating each character to `result`. The output is the reversed string.

Given the output is ",saw", this means the input string must be the reverse of ",saw", which is "was,".

So, the input to the function must have been "was,".
