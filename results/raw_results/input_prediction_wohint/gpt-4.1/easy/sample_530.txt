[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes two arguments: `s` (a string) and `ch` (a character).
2. It sets `sl = s`.
3. If `ch in s`:
   - It sets `sl = s.lstrip(ch)`. This removes all leading occurrences of `ch` from `s`.
   - If `len(sl) == 0`, it sets `sl = sl + '!?` (i.e., sl becomes '!?').
   - Otherwise, it leaves `sl` as is.
4. If `ch not in s`, it returns 'no'.
5. Finally, it returns `sl`.

The output is `"ff"`. So, the function returned `"ff"`.

This means:
- The `else` branch (`return 'no'`) was NOT taken, so `ch in s` is True.
- After `sl = s.lstrip(ch)`, `sl` must be `"ff"`.
- Since the output is `"ff"`, the `if len(sl) == 0` branch was NOT taken (otherwise, output would be `'!?'`).

So, `s.lstrip(ch) == "ff"`, and `ch in s`.

Let's try to reconstruct possible values for `s` and `ch`:

Suppose `ch = 'f'`:
- If `s = "ff"`, then `"ff".lstrip('f')` removes all leading 'f's, so it becomes `""` (empty string). That would trigger the `if len(sl) == 0` branch, and output would be `'!?'`, not `'ff'`.
- If `s = "fff"`, then `"fff".lstrip('f')` is `""` (again, empty).
- If `s = "fffabc"`, then `"fffabc".lstrip('f')` is `"abc"`.

Suppose `ch = 'a'`:
- If `s = "aff"`, then `"aff".lstrip('a')` is `"ff"`. This matches our output!
- Let's check: is `'a' in "aff"'? Yes.
- After lstrip, `sl = "ff"`, which is not empty, so the function returns `"ff"`.

Therefore, one possible input is `s = "aff"`, `ch = "a"`.

Alternatively, if `ch = 'b'` and `s = "bff"`, then `"bff".lstrip('b')` is `"ff"`, and `'b' in "bff"' is True.

So, another possible input is `s = "bff"`, `ch = "b"`.

But the minimal lexicographical answer is `s = "aff"`, `ch = "a"`.
