[THOUGHT]
The method get_fragment returns the part of the URL after the first '#' character, or None if there is no '#'. The output is "aaa", so the URL must contain "#aaa" at the end (or somewhere), and "aaa" is everything after the first '#'. For example, "http://example.com/page#aaa" would work, as would just "#aaa". The method does not take any arguments except self, so the input is the value of self.url.

Therefore, the input should be:
- self: an instance of URLHandler with url set to something containing "#aaa" (e.g., "http://example.com/page#aaa")
- args: empty
- kwargs: empty
