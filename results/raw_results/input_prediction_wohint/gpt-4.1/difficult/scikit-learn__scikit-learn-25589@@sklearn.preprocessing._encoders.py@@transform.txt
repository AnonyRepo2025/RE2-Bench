[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and work backwards to the input of the `transform` method.

The output is a sparse matrix with:
- shape: (2, 4)
- indptr: [0 0 1]
- indices: [1]
- data: [1.]

This means:
- There are 2 samples (rows), 4 features (columns).
- indptr: [0 0 1] means:
    - Row 0: data from data[0:0] (no data, so all zeros)
    - Row 1: data from data[0:1] (one nonzero entry)
- indices: [1] means the nonzero entry in row 1 is at column 1.
- data: [1.] means the value at (row 1, col 1) is 1.

So, the dense version of the output is:
[[0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0]]

This is the result of one-hot encoding with 4 output columns, and only one nonzero in the second row, at column 1.

Now, what could be the input and the encoder state?

1. The encoder must have been fitted already, with 4 output columns.
2. The input to `transform` must be a 2-row, 1-column array (since OneHotEncoder with a single feature and 4 categories gives 4 output columns).
3. The first row is all zeros in the output, which means the input value is unknown or dropped (depending on handle_unknown and drop).
4. The second row has a 1 at column 1, so the input value matches the second category (index 1).

Let's assume the encoder was fitted with categories ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] (or any 4 unique values).

- If handle_unknown='ignore', unknown values in input are encoded as all zeros.
- If drop=None, all categories are encoded.
- If drop='first', the first category is dropped, so only 3 output columns.

But here, we have 4 output columns, so likely drop=None.

So, possible input:
- First row: unknown value (not in ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']), e.g. 'z'
- Second row: value 'b' (index 1 in categories)

So, input = [['z'], ['b']]

Alternatively, if the encoder was fitted with categories [0, 1, 2, 3], then input = [[99], [1]].

But the most common is string categories.

Therefore, the input to transform is a 2x1 array: [['z'], ['b']]

The encoder instance must have:
- categories_ = [np.array(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], dtype=object)]
- drop = None
- handle_unknown = 'ignore'
- _n_features_outs = [4]
- _drop_idx_after_grouping = None
