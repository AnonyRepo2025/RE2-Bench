[THOUGHT]
The function is an expression calculator that parses and evaluates mathematical expressions given as strings. The output is 3.0.

Let's consider what expressions could yield 3.0:
- Simple: "1+2", "6/2", "7-4", "3*1", etc.

Let's check if the function would return 3.0 for "1+2":
- The function removes spaces and trailing '='.
- It handles negative numbers by replacing '-' with '~' in certain contexts.
- It converts infix to postfix, then evaluates.

For "1+2":
- No spaces, no '=' at end.
- No negative numbers.
- Infix: "1+2"
- Postfix: "1 2 +"
- Evaluation: 1 + 2 = 3

The function returns float(eval('*'.join(result_stack))). For "1+2", result_stack will have ["3"], so eval("3") = 3.0.

Therefore, the input expression is "1+2".
