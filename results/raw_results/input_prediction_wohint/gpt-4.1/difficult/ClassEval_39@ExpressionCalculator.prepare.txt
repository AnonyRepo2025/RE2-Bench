[THOUGHT]
The function `prepare` does not return anything (no return statement), so its output is always `None` (which is `null` in JSON). The only input to `prepare` is the `expression` argument, which is a string representing a mathematical expression.

Since the output is always `null`, any valid string input would produce this output. However, to be as specific as possible, let's consider the minimal valid input: a simple arithmetic expression, such as "1+2".

The `self` parameter is an instance of `ExpressionCalculator`, which does not require any special initialization arguments.

Therefore, the input should be:
- self: an instance of ExpressionCalculator (no special state needed)
- args: {"expression": "1+2"}
- kwargs: {}
