[THOUGHT]
The output of `get_many` is `{}` (an empty dictionary). Let's analyze how this can happen.

The relevant code for `get_many` in `BaseCache` is:
```python
def get_many(self, keys, version=None):
    d = {}
    for k in keys:
        val = self.get(k, self._missing_key, version=version)
        if val is not self._missing_key:
            d[k] = val
    return d
```
So, for each key in `keys`, it calls `self.get(k, self._missing_key, version=version)`. If the result is not `self._missing_key`, it adds it to the result dictionary.

For the output to be `{}`, there are two possibilities:
1. `keys` is an empty iterable, so the loop does not run, and `d` remains `{}`.
2. For every key in `keys`, `self.get(k, self._missing_key, version=version)` returns `self._missing_key`, so nothing is added to `d`.

But the most direct way to guarantee an empty output is to provide an empty list (or other empty iterable) for `keys`.

Therefore, the input should be:
- `self`: an instance of `BaseCache` (or subclass, but the base class suffices for this reasoning)
- `args`: `keys` is an empty list (or tuple, or set, etc.)
- `kwargs`: `version` is not specified (defaults to None)

No other arguments are needed.
