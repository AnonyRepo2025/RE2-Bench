[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output.

1. The output is "_x", which is a string representation of a SymPy symbol (likely a Dummy or Symbol named "_x").
2. The function powdenest(eq, force=False, polar=False) is designed to simplify expressions of the form a**(b**c) and similar, but if the input is a simple symbol, it should return it unchanged.
3. The function first checks if force is True, but by default it is False. If force is False and polar is False, it calls powsimp(sympify(eq)), which for a symbol just returns the symbol.
4. Then it applies a Transform, but only to objects that are Pow or exp. A symbol is neither, so it is left unchanged.
5. Therefore, if the output is "_x", the input must have been a symbol named "_x" (or Dummy("_x")).

So, the input is likely a SymPy Dummy or Symbol named "_x", and the default values for force and polar (both False).
