[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and work backwards to the input.

1. The output is a list of two strings: ["3*t_0 - 5", "2*t_0 - 5"]. This suggests that the solution is a parametric solution in terms of t_0, and each string represents an expression for a variable in terms of t_0.

2. The function diop_solve(eq, param=symbols('t', integer=True)) is designed to solve Diophantine equations and return solutions, often as parametric expressions.

3. The output matches the form of a solution to a linear Diophantine equation in two variables, i.e., x = a*t + b, y = c*t + d.

4. Let's try to reconstruct the equation. The general solution to ax + by = c is:
   x = x0 + (b/d)*t
   y = y0 - (a/d)*t
   where d = gcd(a, b), and (x0, y0) is a particular solution.

5. But in the output, both variables are expressed as linear functions of t_0 with coefficients 3 and 2, and both have -5 as the constant term.

6. Let's suppose the variables are x and y, and the solution is:
   x = 3*t_0 - 5
   y = 2*t_0 - 5

7. Let's try to reconstruct the equation that would yield this solution. Substitute x and y into a general linear equation:
   a*x + b*y = c

   Plug in x and y:
   a*(3*t_0 - 5) + b*(2*t_0 - 5) = c
   (3a + 2b)*t_0 - 5a - 5b = c

   For this to be a solution for all integer t_0, the coefficient of t_0 must be zero:
   3a + 2b = 0
   => a = -2k, b = 3k for some integer k

   The constant term is:
   -5a - 5b = c
   Substitute a and b:
   -5*(-2k) - 5*(3k) = c
   10k - 15k = c
   -5k = c

   So, for k=1:
   a = -2, b = 3, c = -5

   Therefore, the equation is:
   -2*x + 3*y = -5

   Let's check if the parametric solution matches:
   x = 3*t_0 - 5
   y = 2*t_0 - 5

   Plug into the equation:
   -2*(3*t_0 - 5) + 3*(2*t_0 - 5) = -6*t_0 + 10 + 6*t_0 - 15 = (10 - 15) = -5

   Yes, it matches.

8. The input to diop_solve is the equation: -2*x + 3*y + 5 = 0, or equivalently, -2*x + 3*y = -5.

   In sympy, the equation is usually given as an expression equal to zero, so: -2*x + 3*y + 5

   The default param is t, but the output uses t_0, which is the default symbol generated by sympy.symbols('t', integer=True).

9. The input should be:
   eq = -2*x + 3*y + 5
   param = t_0 (optional, but default is fine)

   The variables x and y should be sympy.Symbols.

10. The input JSON should specify the equation as a sympy expression, e.g., "-2*x + 3*y + 5", and optionally the param.
