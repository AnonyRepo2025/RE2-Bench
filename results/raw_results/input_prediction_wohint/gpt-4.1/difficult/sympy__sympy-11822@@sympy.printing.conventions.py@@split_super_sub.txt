Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

The function `split_super_sub(text)` takes a string and splits it into three parts:
- name: the base name
- supers: a list of superscripts (after ^ or __)
- subs: a list of subscripts (after _)

At the end, it also checks if the name matches the regex `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$`, i.e., letters followed by digits, and if so, it splits the digits off and puts them as the first subscript.

Given the output:
[
    "alpha",
    [
        "+"
    ],
    [
        "1"
    ]
]

So:
- name: "alpha"
- supers: ["+"]
- subs: ["1"]

Let's reconstruct the input string.

First, the name is "alpha". The function checks for superscripts and subscripts.

The only super is "+", so there must be a "^+" somewhere after the name.

The only sub is "1". But the function also moves digits at the end of the name to the first subscript. So the input could be "alpha1^+" or "alpha^+1".

But let's check the function logic:
- It starts at pos=0, name=None, supers=[], subs=[]
- It looks for ^ and _ after the current position.
- It splits at the first ^ or _.

If the string is "alpha1^+", then:
- pos=0, start=1
- pos_hat = text.find('^', 1) = 6 (the ^ after "alpha1")
- pos_usc = text.find('_', 1) = -1 (so len(text) = 8)
- pos_next = min(6, 8) = 6
- part = text[0:6] = "alpha1"
- pos = 6
- name = "alpha1"
- Now, at pos=6, text[6] = "^"
- part = text[6:8] = "^+"
- Since part.startswith('^'), supers.append(part[1:]) => supers = ["+"]
- pos = 8 (end)

Now, at the end, it matches name "alpha1" with the regex, which splits into "alpha" and "1", and puts "1" as the first subscript.

So, the input string is "alpha1^+".
