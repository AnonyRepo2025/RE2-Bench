Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The output is a 1x1 numpy array with value approximately 1.1649954. This means X and Y are both 1xN arrays (or 1D arrays reshaped to 2D), and the distance between their only rows is 1.1649954.

2. The function computes the Euclidean distance between each pair of rows in X and Y. For 1x1 output, X and Y must both be 1xN.

3. The formula for Euclidean distance between two vectors a and b is sqrt(sum((a_i - b_i)^2)). The squared distance is sum((a_i - b_i)^2), and the function returns sqrt unless squared=True.

4. Let's try to find two 1D vectors whose Euclidean distance is 1.1649954.

Let d = 1.1649954. Then, squared distance = d^2 ≈ 1.3582.

Let’s try simple values. Suppose X = [[a, b]], Y = [[c, d]].

Let’s try X = [[0, 0]], Y = [[x, y]]: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1.1649954 → x^2 + y^2 = 1.3582.

Let’s try X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0, 1]]: sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142 (too high).

Try X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0, 0]]: sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = 1.

Try X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0.5, 1]]: sqrt((1-0.5)^2 + (0-1)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 1) = sqrt(1.25) ≈ 1.118 (a bit low).

Try X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0.5, 1.1]]: sqrt(0.25 + 1.21) = sqrt(1.46) ≈ 1.208 (a bit high).

Try X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0.5, 1.0]]: sqrt(0.25 + 1) = 1.118 (already tried).

Try X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0.4, 1.0]]: (1-0.4)^2 + (0-1)^2 = 0.36 + 1 = 1.36, sqrt(1.36) = 1.16619.

That's very close to 1.1649954.

Try X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0.399, 1.0]]: (1-0.399)^2 = 0.3612, 0.3612 + 1 = 1.3612, sqrt(1.3612) = 1.1666.

Try X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0.398, 1.0]]: (1-0.398)^2 = 0.3624, 0.3624 + 1 = 1.3624, sqrt(1.3624) = 1.1670.

Try X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0.38, 1.0]]: (1-0.38)^2 = 0.3844, 0.3844 + 1 = 1.3844, sqrt(1.3844) = 1.1766.

So, for (1-x)^2 + 1 = 1.3582 → (1-x)^2 = 0.3582 → 1-x = sqrt(0.3582) ≈ 0.5985 → x ≈ 0.4015.

So, X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0.4015, 1.0]].

Check: (1-0.4015)^2 + (0-1)^2 = (0.5985)^2 + 1 = 0.3582 + 1 = 1.3582, sqrt(1.3582) = 1.1649954.

So, X = [[1, 0]], Y = [[0.4015, 1.0]] will give the required output.

Alternatively, X = [[0, 0]], Y = [[a, b]] with a^2 + b^2 = 1.3582, e.g., a = sqrt(1.3582), b = 0.

But the above is a more "integer-like" solution.

5. The function signature is euclidean_distances(X, Y=None, Y_norm_squared=None, squared=False, X_norm_squared=None). Since the output is not squared, squared=False.

6. The output is a string representation of a numpy array: "[[1.1649954]]". So the input arrays are 2D, shape (1, 2).

7. The minimal input is:
X = [[1.0, 0.0]]
Y = [[0.4015, 1.0]]

All other parameters are default.
