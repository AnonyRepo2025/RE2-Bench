[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and reconstruct the input step by step.

1. **Class and Method**: The method is `fit` of `TransformedTargetRegressor`.

2. **Output State**: The output shows the internal state of a `TransformedTargetRegressor` after fitting:
   - `regressor` is a `LinearRegression` with default parameters.
   - `transformer` is `null`, but `func` and `inverse_func` are set to `sqrt` and `log` respectively.
   - `transformer_` is a `FunctionTransformer` with `func=sqrt`, `inverse_func=log`, `validate=True`.
   - `regressor_` is a fitted `LinearRegression` with 10 coefficients, indicating 10 features.

3. **What does `fit` do?**
   - It takes `X` and `y`.
   - It checks and reshapes `y` to 2D if needed.
   - It creates a `FunctionTransformer` with `func` and `inverse_func` (since `transformer` is None).
   - It fits the transformer on `y_2d`.
   - It transforms `y_2d` using `sqrt`.
   - It fits the regressor on `X` and the transformed `y`.
   - The regressor is a `LinearRegression` with 10 coefficients, so `X` must have 10 features.

4. **What must the input have been?**
   - `X`: 2D array, shape (n_samples, 10).
   - `y`: 1D array, shape (n_samples,).
   - The regressor's coefficients and intercept are floats, so the data is numeric.
   - The transformer is `sqrt` for `func` and `log` for `inverse_func`. For `sqrt` to be valid, `y` must be non-negative.
   - The regressor's `_residues` is about 14.6, which is the sum of squared residuals, so n_samples is likely > 10.

5. **How many samples?**
   - The regressor's `singular_` array has 10 values, matching the number of features.
   - The number of samples must be at least 10, but likely more (since rank is 10).
   - Let's assume a typical small regression example: 20 samples.

6. **What are the values?**
   - We don't need to reconstruct the exact values, just the structure.
   - `X`: shape (20, 10), numeric.
   - `y`: shape (20,), non-negative.

7. **Other arguments:**
   - No extra `fit_params` are shown, so none were passed.

8. **Summary:**
   - The input to `fit` was:
     - `X`: 2D numeric array, shape (20, 10)
     - `y`: 1D numeric array, shape (20,), all values >= 0
     - No extra kwargs
