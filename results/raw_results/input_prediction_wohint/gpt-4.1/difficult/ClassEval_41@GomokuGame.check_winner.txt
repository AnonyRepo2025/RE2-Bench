[THOUGHT]
The function `check_winner` returns the symbol ('X' or 'O') of the player who has five in a row in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, anti-diagonal) on the board. The output is "O", so there must be a line of five 'O's somewhere on the board.

The input to `check_winner` is just `self` (the GomokuGame instance), so the only relevant input is the state of the board and the board size.

To get output "O", the board must have at least one sequence of five 'O's in a row, column, or diagonal.

Let's pick a simple case: a 5x5 board, with 'O' filling the first row:

[
 ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']
]

Alternatively, it could be a vertical, diagonal, or anti-diagonal, but the horizontal is the simplest.

The `current_player` is not relevant for `check_winner`, but it is part of the object.

So, the input is a GomokuGame instance with board_size=5, board as above, and current_player can be anything (let's keep 'X').
