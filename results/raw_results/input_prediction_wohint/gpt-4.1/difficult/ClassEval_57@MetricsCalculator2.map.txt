[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `map` in `MetricsCalculator2` and the output.

The output is:
[
    0.0,
    [
        0.0
    ]
]

From the code, there are two main branches for input:
- If input is a tuple: (sub_list, total_num)
- If input is a list: [ (sub_list, total_num), ... ]

In both cases, if `total_num == 0`, the function returns (0.0, [0.0]) (for tuple) or appends 0.0 to the result list (for list).

But the output is exactly (0.0, [0.0]), which matches the tuple branch:
    if type(data) == tuple:
        ...
        if total_num == 0:
            return (0.0, [0.0])

So, the input must be a tuple where the second element (total_num) is 0. The first element (sub_list) can be anything, but likely an empty list or any list, since total_num=0 will short-circuit.

Therefore, the input is something like: ([...], 0)

The most minimal and likely input is ([], 0).

Alternatively, if the input is a list with one element, and that element's total_num is 0, the output would be (0.0, [0.0]) as well, because:
    for sub_list, total_num in data:
        if total_num == 0:
            ap = 0.0
        ...
    separate_result.append(ap)
    return (np.mean(separate_result), separate_result)

If the list has only one element, np.mean([0.0]) == 0.0, so output is (0.0, [0.0]).

So both ([], 0) and [([], 0)] would produce this output.

But, in the code, the tuple branch returns (0.0, [0.0]) directly, while the list branch constructs [0.0] and returns (0.0, [0.0]).

Either is possible, but the tuple is more direct.

Therefore, the most likely input is ([], 0).
