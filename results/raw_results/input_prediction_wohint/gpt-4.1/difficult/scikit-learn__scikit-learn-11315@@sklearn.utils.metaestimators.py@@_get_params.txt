[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function in question is `_get_params(self, attr, deep=True)` from `_BaseComposition`.
2. It first calls `super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)`, which is `BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=deep)`.
3. The output contains keys like `"remainder__copy"`, `"remainder__with_mean"`, `"remainder__with_std"`, and `"remainder"`, which is a dict with those keys as values. This suggests that there is an attribute called `"remainder"` which is an estimator (probably a StandardScaler or similar), and its parameters are being exposed with the `__` notation.
4. The output also contains `"trans1": "passthrough"`, which suggests that there is a transformer named `"trans1"` with value `"passthrough"`.
5. The output contains `"transformers": null`, which suggests that the attribute `"transformers"` is set to `None`.
6. The function takes an `attr` argument, which is the name of the attribute containing the list of estimators. In sklearn, for a ColumnTransformer, this would be `"transformers"`.
7. The function, after getting the base params, does:
   - `estimators = getattr(self, attr)` (so, `self.transformers`)
   - `out.update(estimators)` (so, if estimators is a dict, it updates the output with its items)
   - Then, for each `(name, estimator)` in `estimators`, if `estimator` has `get_params`, it adds all its params as `name__param`.
8. In the output, `"remainder"` is a dict, and its params are also present as `"remainder__copy"`, etc. This means that in `estimators`, there is a tuple `("remainder", <estimator>)`, where `<estimator>` is an object with those params.
9. The output also contains `"trans1": "passthrough"`, so in `estimators`, there is a tuple `("trans1", "passthrough")`.
10. The output contains `"transformers": null`, so the attribute `"transformers"` is `None`.
11. The output contains `"transformer_weights": null`, so the attribute `"transformer_weights"` is `None`.
12. The output contains `"n_jobs": 1`, so the attribute `"n_jobs"` is `1`.

So, the input must be:
- `self` is an object with at least the following attributes:
  - `transformers = [("remainder", <estimator>), ("trans1", "passthrough")]`
  - `transformer_weights = None`
  - `n_jobs = 1`
- The estimator for `"remainder"` must have `with_mean=True`, `with_std=False`, `copy=True`.
- The function is called as `_get_params(attr="transformers", deep=True)`.
