[THOUGHT]
Let's try to reverse-engineer the input to `log_loss` that would produce an output of `2.2204460492503136e-16`.

1. **Understanding log_loss**:  
   The log loss for a single sample and perfect prediction is 0. However, due to floating point precision, it can be a very small positive number, like the one shown here (`2.2204460492503136e-16`), which is `np.finfo(np.float64).eps`.

2. **How is log_loss computed?**  
   - `y_true` is binarized.
   - `y_pred` is clipped to `[eps, 1-eps]`.
   - If `y_pred` is 1D, it's reshaped to 2D.
   - If only one class, it raises.
   - If `y_pred` has only one column, it's expanded to two columns: `[1-y_pred, y_pred]`.
   - The loss is `-xlogy(transformed_labels, y_pred).sum(axis=1)`.
   - If `normalize` is True (default), returns mean loss.

3. **What input would give a log loss of `eps`?**  
   - For a single sample, if the predicted probability for the true class is `1-eps`, then the log loss is `-log(1-eps) ≈ eps` (for small eps).
   - But the output is not exactly `eps`, it's `2.2204460492503136e-16`, which is `np.finfo(np.float64).eps`.

4. **Let's try a simple case:**
   - `y_true = [1]`
   - `y_pred = [1 - eps]` (for class 1)
   - But the function will expand this to `[eps, 1-eps]` for two classes.
   - The binarizer will transform `y_true` to `[0, 1]` (for class 1).
   - The loss is `-log(1-eps)` for the true class, which is approximately `eps`.

5. **Alternatively, if `y_pred = [1]`, it will be clipped to `1-eps`, so the loss is again `-log(1-eps) ≈ eps`.**

6. **So, the minimal input is:**
   - `y_true = [1]`
   - `y_pred = [1]` (or `[1.0]`)
   - The function will clip to `1-eps`, expand to `[eps, 1-eps]`, and the loss will be `-log(1-eps) ≈ eps`.

7. **Check for class labels:**
   - If `y_true = [1]`, the binarizer will use classes `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on input.
   - Let's use `y_true = [1]`, `y_pred = [1.0]`.

8. **Check for shape:**
   - `y_pred` can be 1D, the function will expand it.

9. **Check for sample_weight, labels, normalize:**
   - All defaults.

10. **Conclusion:**
    - Input: `y_true = [1]`, `y_pred = [1.0]`, all other parameters default.
