[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function extract_code_from_html_text. It takes html_text as input, processes it with format_line_html_text, and then looks for code blocks (pre or blockquote tags) in the HTML. For each such tag, it extracts the text content and returns a list of code snippets.

The output is a list of two code snippets:
1. "print('Hello, world!')"
2. "for i in range(4):\n                print(i)"

This means the input HTML must have at least two code blocks (either <pre> or <blockquote>), each containing one of these code snippets.

The function uses BeautifulSoup to find all <pre> and <blockquote> tags, and for each, extracts the text.

So, the input should be an HTML string with two code blocks, one containing "print('Hello, world!')" and the other containing "for i in range(4):\n                print(i)". The indentation in the second code block is preserved, so the HTML should preserve the whitespace (which <pre> does).

Therefore, the input should be something like:
<pre>print('Hello, world!')</pre>
<pre>for i in range(4):
                print(i)</pre>

Alternatively, it could be <blockquote> tags, but <pre> is more standard for code.

So, the input is:
html_text = "<pre>print('Hello, world!')</pre><pre>for i in range(4):\n                print(i)</pre>"

The function is a method, so self is an instance of HtmlUtil.

No kwargs.
