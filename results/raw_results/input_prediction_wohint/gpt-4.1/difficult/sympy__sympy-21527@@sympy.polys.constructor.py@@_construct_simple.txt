Let's analyze the function `_construct_simple` and the output.

The output is:
```
[
    {},
    null
]
```
This is a JSON representation. In Python, this would correspond to a tuple: ({}, None).

But let's be precise: the function returns either (domain, result) or False/None in some cases.

1. The function starts by initializing several flags: rationals, floats, complexes, algebraics = False, and float_numbers = [].
2. It defines is_algebraic depending on opt.extension.
3. It loops over coeffs, and for each coeff, it checks:
   - If coeff.is_Rational: sets rationals = True if not Integer.
   - If coeff.is_Float: sets floats = True, appends to float_numbers.
   - Else, tries pure_complex(coeff):
     - If complex, sets complexes = True, and checks if x and y are Rational, etc.
     - If is_algebraic(coeff): sets algebraics = True.
     - Else: returns None.

4. After the loop, if algebraics: calls _construct_algebraic, else:
   - If floats and complexes: domain = ComplexField
   - elif floats: domain = RealField
   - elif rationals or opt.field: domain = QQ_I if complexes else QQ
   - else: domain = ZZ_I if complexes else ZZ
   - result = [domain.from_sympy(coeff) for coeff in coeffs]
   - returns (domain, result)

So, for the function to return ({}, None), the only way is if _construct_algebraic returns ({}, None), and algebraics is True.

So, the function must have entered the algebraics branch:
- algebraics = True
- floats = False (otherwise, it would return False)
- _construct_algebraic(coeffs, opt) returns ({}, None)

Therefore, the input must be:
- coeffs: at least one element, and at least one triggers is_algebraic(coeff) == True, and none are Float.
- opt.extension is True (otherwise is_algebraic always returns False).

But _construct_algebraic is not shown, but for the output to be ({}, None), it must return that.

So, let's pick a simple algebraic number, e.g., sqrt(2), which is algebraic.

So, coeffs = [sqrt(2)], and opt.extension = True.

Thus, the input is:
coeffs = [sqrt(2)]
opt.extension = True

But since the output is JSON, sqrt(2) would be represented as something like {"type": "sqrt", "arg": 2} or similar, but in the input, we just need to specify that.

So, the input is:
coeffs: [sqrt(2)]
opt: an object with extension=True
