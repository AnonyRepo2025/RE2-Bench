[THOUGHT]
The `solve` method returns a list of moves to reach the goal state from the initial state. If the output is an empty list (`[]`), it means that the initial state is already the goal state, so no moves are needed.

The goal state is defined as:
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 0]]

Therefore, the input must be such that `self.initial_state` is equal to `self.goal_state`. The `solve` method does not take any arguments, so the only input is the initial state provided to the constructor.
