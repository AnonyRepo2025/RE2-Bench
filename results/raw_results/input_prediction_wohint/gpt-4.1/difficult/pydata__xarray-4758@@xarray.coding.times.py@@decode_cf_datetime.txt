[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and work backwards to deduce the input.

1. The output is a numpy array of datetime64[ns] values:
   ```
   ['1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000' '1681-05-27T13:00:00.500000000'
    '1681-05-27T14:00:00.500000000' '1681-05-27T15:00:00.500000000'
    '1681-05-27T16:00:00.500000000']
   ```
   These are consecutive hours, starting from 12:00:00.500000000, on 1681-05-27.

2. The function `decode_cf_datetime(num_dates, units, calendar=None, use_cftime=None)` decodes numeric time values (num_dates) into datetimes, using a units string like "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.500".

3. The output datetimes are all on the same day, with the hour increasing by 1 each time, and the nanoseconds part is always .500000000 (i.e., 0.5 seconds).

4. Let's try to reconstruct the likely units and num_dates:
   - The reference date is 1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000.
   - The first output is exactly the reference date.
   - The next outputs are +1h, +2h, +3h, +4h.

5. This suggests:
   - units = "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.500"
   - num_dates = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

6. The calendar is likely "standard" (default), since the year is 1681 and the function will use cftime if pandas fails, but pandas can handle this range.

7. The function will try pandas first, and pandas can handle this range, so it will succeed.

8. The input array is probably a 1D array: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

9. The output is a numpy array, so the input should be a numpy array as well.

10. The function signature is:
    decode_cf_datetime(num_dates, units, calendar=None, use_cftime=None)

11. The minimal input is:
    - num_dates: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    - units: "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.500"
    - calendar: not specified (defaults to "standard")
    - use_cftime: not specified (defaults to None)

12. To match the output exactly, the input should be:
    num_dates = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    units = "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.500"
    calendar = None
    use_cftime = None

13. In JSON, numpy arrays are represented as lists.

14. The input should be:
    {
        "num_dates": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
        "units": "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.500"
    }
    (calendar and use_cftime omitted, as they default to None)
