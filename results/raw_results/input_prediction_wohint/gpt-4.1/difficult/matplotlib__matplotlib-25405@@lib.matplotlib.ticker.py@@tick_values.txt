Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The output is a numpy array: [1.e-01 1.e+00 1.e+01 1.e+02 1.e+03 1.e+04], which is [0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000].
2. These are powers of 10: 10^-1, 10^0, 10^1, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4.
3. The LogLocator class is used to generate tick locations for a logarithmic axis. The main parameters that affect the output are:
   - self._base (the logarithmic base, default is 10)
   - self._subs (subdivisions, default is 'auto' or [1.0])
   - self.numticks (number of ticks, default is 'auto')
   - vmin, vmax (the range for which ticks are generated)
4. The code computes:
   - log_vmin = log(vmin) / log(b)
   - log_vmax = log(vmax) / log(b)
   - decades = np.arange(math.floor(log_vmin) - stride, math.ceil(log_vmax) + 2 * stride, stride)
   - ticklocs = b ** decades
5. The output array has 6 values, so the range of exponents is from -1 to 4 (inclusive).
6. Therefore, vmin must be 0.1 (10^-1), vmax must be 10000 (10^4), or at least the range must cover these exponents.
7. The default base is 10, and the default subs is [1.0], so only the main ticks are shown.
8. The stride is likely 1, so every decade is shown.
9. The default numticks is 'auto', which, if axis is None, is set to 9.
10. So, the most likely call is: tick_values(0.1, 10000) with default LogLocator (base=10, subs=[1.0], numticks='auto').

Therefore, the input is:
- self: LogLocator with _base=10, _subs=[1.0], numticks='auto', axis=None
- vmin: 0.1
- vmax: 10000
