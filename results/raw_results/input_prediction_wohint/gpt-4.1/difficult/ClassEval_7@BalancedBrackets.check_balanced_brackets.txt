[THOUGHT]
The function `check_balanced_brackets` checks if the brackets in the string `expr` are balanced. It first filters `expr` to only contain brackets, then uses a stack to check for matching pairs.

The output is `false`, so the brackets are not balanced. Let's consider possible cases:
- There is a mismatch (e.g., "([)]", "({]", etc.)
- There are more opening than closing brackets (e.g., "(((")
- There are more closing than opening brackets (e.g., "())")

The function is a method of the `BalancedBrackets` class, so the input is the value of `expr` in the instance.

Let's try an example: "([)]"
- clear_expr: "([)]"
- Stack: []
- Brkt: '(', stack: ['(']
- Brkt: '[', stack: ['(', '[']
- Brkt: ')', stack: ['('] (pop '['), '[' != ')', so return False

This would return False.

Alternatively, "(()" would also return False, as the stack would not be empty at the end.

But since the function returns False as soon as a mismatch is found, "([)]" is a good candidate.

So, the input should be:
- self: {"expr": "([)]"}
- args: {}
- kwargs: {}
