[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function is_valid_move and the test case.

- The test creates a MahjongConnect object with BOARD_SIZE [4, 4] and ICONS ['a', 'b', 'c'].
- The board is set to:
    [
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a'],
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a']
    ]
- The test calls is_valid_move((0, 0), (1, 0)), which are both 'a' tiles.

Let's check the logic of is_valid_move:
- Checks if both positions are in bounds: (0,0) and (1,0) are both in bounds.
- Checks if pos1 == pos2: they are different.
- Checks if the tiles are the same: both are 'a'.
- Checks if has_path(pos1, pos2): this is the key.

has_path uses DFS to see if you can reach pos2 from pos1 by moving only to adjacent tiles of the same value.

From (0,0), adjacent positions are:
- (0,1): 'b' (not 'a')
- (0,-1): out of bounds
- (1,0): 'a' (this is pos2)
- (-1,0): out of bounds

So, (1,0) is reachable directly from (0,0), and both are 'a'. So has_path((0,0),(1,0)) should return True.

But the test expects is_valid_move((0,0),(1,0)) to return False.

But the output is false, so the input must be a pair of positions that are either not the same tile, or not connected, or out of bounds, or the same position.

Let's try to find such a pair.

Possibilities:
- Out of bounds: e.g., (0,0), (4,0) or (0,0), (-1,0)
- Same position: (0,0), (0,0)
- Different tiles: e.g., (0,0), (0,1) ('a' vs 'b')
- No path: but in this board, all same tiles are adjacent vertically, so path exists for same tile in same column.

So, the simplest is to pick two positions with different tiles.

For example, (0,0) is 'a', (0,1) is 'b'.

So, is_valid_move((0,0), (0,1)) should return False.

Therefore, the input is likely:
    pos1 = (0,0)
    pos2 = (0,1)
