[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `urlencode` takes `query` and `doseq=False`.
2. If `query` is a `MultiValueDict`, it calls `query.lists()`. If it has `.items()`, it calls that. Otherwise, it expects an iterable of (key, value) pairs.
3. For each (key, value):
   - If value is None, it raises TypeError.
   - If value is a string, bytes, or not doseq, it uses value as is.
   - Otherwise, it tries to iterate value (for doseq=True), and for each item, if item is None, raises TypeError, else converts to str if not bytes.
   - Appends (key, query_val) to query_params.
4. Calls `original_urlencode(query_params, doseq)`.

Given the output is "a=1&b=2&c=3", and doseq is not specified (so defaults to False).

- This is the standard output for a dict: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3} or a list of tuples: [("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)].
- If doseq=False, then values are not iterated, so values must be simple (not lists/tuples).
- If input was a MultiValueDict, its .lists() would yield ("a", [1]), ("b", [2]), etc., but with doseq=False, the value would be the list itself, and original_urlencode would encode it as "a=%5B1%5D" (the string representation of the list), not "a=1".
- Therefore, the input is most likely a dict or list of tuples with simple values.

So, the input is either:
- {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
- [("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)]

But since the function checks for .items(), and dicts have .items(), the most natural input is a dict.
