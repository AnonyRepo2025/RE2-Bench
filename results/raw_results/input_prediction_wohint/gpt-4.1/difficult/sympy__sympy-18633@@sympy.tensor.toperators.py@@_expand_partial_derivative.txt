[THOUGHT]
We are told that the output of `_expand_partial_derivative` is an object with `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` all set to null (i.e., None in Python). Let's analyze what input to `_expand_partial_derivative` would produce this.

First, `_expand_partial_derivative` is a method of the `PartialDerivative` class, which is a subclass of `TensExpr`. The method is called on a `PartialDerivative` object (`self`).

The method starts by calling `self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)`, which returns `args, indices, free, dum`. Then, it creates a new object: `obj = self.func(*args)`, and sets `obj._indices = indices`, `obj._free = free`, `obj._dum = dum`.

Then, it sets `result = obj`.

The next lines check:
- If `not args[0].free_symbols`, return `S.Zero`.
- If `isinstance(obj.expr, TensAdd)`, do something.
- If `isinstance(obj.expr, TensMul)`, do something.
- Otherwise, return `result`.

But in all cases, the only place where `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` are set is in the line:
```
obj._indices = indices
obj._free = free
obj._dum = dum
```
and then `result = obj`.

So, for the output to be:
```
{
    "_indices": null,
    "_free": null,
    "_dum": null
}
```
it must be that `indices`, `free`, and `dum` are all `None` (i.e., null in JSON).

But looking at `_contract_indices_for_derivative`, it always returns the result of `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices`, which always returns tuples (lists) for `indices`, `free`, and `dum` (see the function code). There is no code path that returns `None` for these values unless the input is such that the lists are empty, or the input is such that the function is not called at all.

Alternatively, perhaps the method returns `S.Zero` (i.e., sympy's zero object), which does not have `_indices`, `_free`, or `_dum` attributes, so when serializing, these are null.

But the output is an object with those attributes set to null, not missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the input is such that the method returns `S.Zero`, and the serialization code tries to access `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` on `S.Zero`, which does not have them, so they are null.

But let's look at the code:
```
if not args[0].free_symbols:
    return S.Zero
```
So, if the first argument (`args[0]`) has no free symbols, the method returns `S.Zero`.

Therefore, the only way for the output to be an object with `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` all null is if the method returns `S.Zero`, and the serialization code tries to access those attributes, finds they don't exist, and sets them to null.

Therefore, the input must be a `PartialDerivative` object whose `expr` has no free symbols.

What is a minimal such input? For example, `PartialDerivative(1, x)` where `1` is a number (no free symbols), and `x` is a symbol.

So, the input is a `PartialDerivative` object with `expr=1` and `variables=(x,)`, where `x` is a `Symbol`.

Therefore, the input to `_expand_partial_derivative` is a `PartialDerivative` object with `expr=1` and `variables=(x,)`.
