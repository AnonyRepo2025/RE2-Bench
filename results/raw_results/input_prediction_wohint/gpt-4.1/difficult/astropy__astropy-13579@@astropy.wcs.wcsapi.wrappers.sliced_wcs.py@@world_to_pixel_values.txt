[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `world_to_pixel_values` in `SlicedLowLevelWCS` and how the output could be produced.

1. **Function signature and output**:  
   The function is called as `world_to_pixel_values(*world_arrays)`. The output is a list of two floats:  
   ```
   [
       "-2.9416469260468148e-12",
       "-7.123190925995004e-13"
   ]
   ```
   These are very close to zero, suggesting that the world coordinates given correspond to the reference pixel (or origin) in the WCS.

2. **How does the function work?**  
   - It first computes `sliced_out_world_coords = self._pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep))`.  
     This means: for each pixel axis that is kept, it passes 0 as the pixel coordinate, and computes the corresponding world coordinates.
   - Then, it builds `world_arrays_new` by replacing the world axes that are not kept with the value from `sliced_out_world_coords`.
   - It then calls `self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values(*world_arrays_new)`, which returns a tuple of pixel coordinates.
   - For each pixel axis, if the corresponding slice has a nonzero start, it subtracts that start from the pixel coordinate.
   - Finally, it returns the pixel coordinates for the kept axes.

3. **What input would produce pixel coordinates very close to zero?**  
   - If the world coordinates given are exactly those corresponding to pixel (0, 0, ..., 0), then the output pixel coordinates should be (0, 0, ..., 0).
   - However, due to floating point precision, the output may be very small numbers close to zero, as in the output above.

4. **What is the likely input?**  
   - The input to `world_to_pixel_values` is a tuple of world coordinates, one for each kept world axis.
   - If we pass the world coordinates that correspond to pixel (0, 0, ..., 0), then the output will be (0, 0, ..., 0) (modulo floating point error).
   - Therefore, the input is likely to be the result of `self._pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep))`.

5. **What is the value of `self._pixel_keep`?**  
   - Since the output is a list of two values, `len(self._pixel_keep)` is 2.
   - So, the input to `self._pixel_to_world_values_all` is (0, 0).

6. **What is the value of `sliced_out_world_coords`?**  
   - It is the world coordinates corresponding to pixel (0, 0).

7. **Therefore, the input to `world_to_pixel_values` is the world coordinates corresponding to pixel (0, 0)**.

8. **Final answer**:  
   The input is the world coordinates corresponding to pixel (0, 0), i.e., the result of `self._pixel_to_world_values_all(0, 0)`.  
   Since the output is two values, the input is a list of two values, which are the world coordinates at pixel (0, 0).

   Since the output is almost exactly zero, it is likely that the WCS is such that pixel (0, 0) maps to world (0, 0), so the input is `[0.0, 0.0]`.

   But to be precise, the input is the world coordinates at pixel (0, 0), which, given the output, are `[0.0, 0.0]`.

   So, the input to `world_to_pixel_values` is `[0.0, 0.0]`.
