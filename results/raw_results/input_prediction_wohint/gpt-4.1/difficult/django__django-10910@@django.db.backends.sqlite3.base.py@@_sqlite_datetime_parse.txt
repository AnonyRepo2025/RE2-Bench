[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step to determine what input would produce the output `"2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00"`.

1. The function `_sqlite_datetime_parse(dt, tzname=None, conn_tzname=None)` takes three arguments:
   - `dt`: a string or datetime object (but usually a string from the DB)
   - `tzname`: a string representing a timezone name (e.g., "UTC", "Europe/Berlin", etc.)
   - `conn_tzname`: a string representing the connection's timezone name

2. The function first checks if `dt` is None. If so, returns None. Our output is not None, so `dt` is not None.

3. It then tries to parse `dt` using `backend_utils.typecast_timestamp(dt)`. This function expects a string like "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.microseconds][+/-TZ]".

4. If `conn_tzname` is provided, it sets the tzinfo of the datetime to `pytz.timezone(conn_tzname)`. If not, it leaves it as is.

5. If `tzname` is provided and is different from `conn_tzname`, it tries to adjust the datetime to the new timezone, possibly parsing a "+HH:MM" or "-HH:MM" offset.

6. Finally, it returns the datetime object (possibly converted to a different timezone).

7. The output is `"2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00"`, which is a string representation of a datetime with UTC offset.

8. The function returns a datetime object, not a string, so the output must be the string representation of the returned datetime object, i.e., `str(result)` or `result.isoformat()`.

9. To get `"2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00"`, the datetime object must be: `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)` or equivalent.

10. Let's try to find what input would produce this:
    - If `dt` is `"2016-06-13 00:00:00"`, and both `tzname` and `conn_tzname` are None, then `typecast_timestamp` will create a naive datetime (no tzinfo).
    - If `dt` is `"2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00"`, then `typecast_timestamp` will parse the offset and create a datetime with tzinfo UTC.
    - If `dt` is `"2016-06-13 00:00:00"`, and `conn_tzname` is "UTC", then after parsing, the function will set tzinfo to UTC.
    - If `dt` is `"2016-06-13 00:00:00"`, and `tzname` is "UTC", and `conn_tzname` is None, then after parsing, the function will try to convert to UTC, but if the datetime is naive, `timezone.localtime` will raise an error.

11. The simplest way to get a datetime with tzinfo UTC is to provide `dt="2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00"` and both `tzname` and `conn_tzname` as None.

12. Alternatively, if `dt="2016-06-13 00:00:00"`, and `conn_tzname="UTC"`, the function will set tzinfo to UTC.

13. Both approaches would work, but the most direct is to provide the full string with offset.

14. Therefore, the input is:
    - `dt`: "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00"
    - `tzname`: None
    - `conn_tzname`: None
