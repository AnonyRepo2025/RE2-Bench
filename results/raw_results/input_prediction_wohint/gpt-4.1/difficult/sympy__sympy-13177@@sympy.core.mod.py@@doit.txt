[THOUGHT]
We are given the output "nan" from the Mod function's eval/doit logic. We need to find inputs p and q such that Mod.eval(p, q) returns nan.

Let's look at the first lines of doit(p, q):

    if p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or (q is nan):
        return nan

So, if either p or q is infinite, or p is nan, or q is nan, then the result is nan.

Therefore, any of the following will work:
- p is nan
- q is nan
- p is infinite
- q is infinite

The simplest is to set p = nan, q = anything (say, 1).

In SymPy, nan is sympy.core.numbers.nan.

So, the input to doit should be p = nan, q = 1.

Alternatively, q = nan, p = 1 would also work.

But let's use p = nan, q = 1.
