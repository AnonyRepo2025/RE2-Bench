[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function Application._eval_subs and the output.

The output is "2*x", which is a SymPy expression. The method _eval_subs is a method for symbolic substitution: it replaces an "old" subexpression with a "new" one in the current expression (self).

The method signature is:
def _eval_subs(self, old, new):

It checks if old and new are both functions, and if so, and if old == self.func, and len(self.args) in new.nargs, then it returns new(*[i._subs(old, new) for i in self.args]).

Otherwise, it does nothing (returns None), and the fallback is called, which recursively substitutes in the arguments.

Given that the output is "2*x", let's try to reconstruct what the input could be.

Possibility 1: The input expression is something like "x + x", and we substitute x -> 2*x, so the result is 2*x + 2*x = 4*x. But that's not "2*x".

Possibility 2: The input expression is "x", and we substitute x -> 2*x, so the result is 2*x.

Possibility 3: The input expression is "f(x)", and we substitute f -> 2, so the result is 2*x.

But in SymPy, substituting a function with a number is not standard.

Possibility 4: The input expression is "y", and we substitute y -> 2*x, so the result is 2*x.

So, the most likely scenario is that self is the symbol y, old is y, and new is 2*x.

But the method _eval_subs is a method of Application, which is a subclass of Function. So self is likely a function application, e.g., f(x), or just a symbol.

But in SymPy, symbols also have _subs methods.

Alternatively, perhaps self is x, old is x, new is 2*x.

So, let's try:

self: x
old: x
new: 2*x

x._subs(x, 2*x) -> 2*x

So, the input is:
self: x
old: x
new: 2*x

But the method is Application._eval_subs, so self should be an Application instance, i.e., a function application.

Alternatively, perhaps self is x, and the method is called from Symbol._subs, which calls Basic._subs, which calls _eval_subs.

But the code provided is for Application._eval_subs.

Alternatively, perhaps self is an Application instance, but the substitution is for a variable inside the arguments.

But in that case, the fallback will be called, which will substitute in the arguments.

So, for example, self: f(x), old: x, new: 2*x

f(x)._subs(x, 2*x) -> f(2*x)

But the output is "2*x", not "f(2*x)".

So, the only way to get "2*x" is if self is x, old is x, new is 2*x.

Therefore, the input is:
self: x
old: x
new: 2*x

In JSON, this would be:
{
    "self": "x",
    "old": "x",
    "new": "2*x"
}
