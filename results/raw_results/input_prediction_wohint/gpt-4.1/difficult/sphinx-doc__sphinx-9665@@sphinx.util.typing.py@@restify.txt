[THOUGHT]
We are told that the output of the function restify is ":py:obj:`None`".

Let's look at the code for restify:

- The first check is:
    if cls is None or cls is NoneType:
        return ':py:obj:`None`'

So, if the input is either None or NoneType, the function will return ":py:obj:`None`".

NoneType is defined as type(None).

So, both restify(None) and restify(type(None)) will return ":py:obj:`None`".

Therefore, the input could be either None or type(None).

The output JSON key is "output", so the function was called as restify(cls), and the output was ":py:obj:`None`".

Thus, the input could be either:
- {"cls": null} (for None)
- {"cls": <the type object for NoneType, i.e., type(None)>}

But in JSON, type objects are not serializable, so the only possible JSON input is {"cls": null}.

Therefore, the input is:
```
{
    "cls": null
}
```

[INPUT]
```
{
    "cls": null
}
