[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function `get_format(format_type, lang=None, use_l10n=None)` is called and returns `"jS \\o\\f F"`.

2. The function first checks if `use_l10n` is None. If so, it tries to get it from `settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL` or `settings.USE_L10N`.

3. If `use_l10n` is True and `lang` is None, it sets `lang = get_language()`.

4. It then checks the cache for `(format_type, lang)`. If not found, it tries to get the value from format modules for the language, or from settings.

5. If `format_type` is not in `FORMAT_SETTINGS`, it returns `format_type` as is.

6. If the value is still None, it gets it from `settings`.

7. If `format_type` is in `ISO_INPUT_FORMATS`, it appends ISO formats.

8. The output is `"jS \\o\\f F"`. This is a typical Django date format string, and by default, Django's `DATE_FORMAT` is `"jS \\o\\f F"`.

9. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that `get_format` was called with `format_type="DATE_FORMAT"`, and either `lang` and `use_l10n` were left as default (None), or set to values that would result in the default format.

10. Since the output is the default, and not a localized or custom value, it's most likely that:
    - `format_type="DATE_FORMAT"`
    - `lang=None`
    - `use_l10n=None` (or True, but default is None)

11. The output is a string, not a list or tuple, so it's not an input format (those would be lists).

12. Therefore, the input is:
    - `format_type="DATE_FORMAT"`
    - `lang=None`
    - `use_l10n=None`
