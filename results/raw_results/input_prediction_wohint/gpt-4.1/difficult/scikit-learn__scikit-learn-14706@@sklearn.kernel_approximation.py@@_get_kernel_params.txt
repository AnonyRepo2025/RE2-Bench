We are given the output of the `_get_kernel_params` method, which is a dictionary containing `{"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}`.

Let's step through the `_get_kernel_params` method to see what input values would produce this output.

1. The method starts by setting `params = self.kernel_params`. If `self.kernel_params` is `None`, it sets `params = {}`.
2. Next, it checks if `self.kernel` is not callable and not equal to `'precomputed'`. If so, it iterates over `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]` and, for each param, if `getattr(self, param)` is not `None`, it adds it to `params`.
3. Otherwise, if `self.gamma`, `self.coef0`, or `self.degree` is not `None`, it raises a ValueError.

Given the output, the following must be true:
- `self.kernel` is a string (not callable), and not `'precomputed'`.
- `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]` must include `'coef0'` and `'degree'`.
- `self.coef0` is 0.1, `self.degree` is 3.1, and both are not `None`.
- `self.gamma` is either `None` or not in `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]` (otherwise it would appear in the output).
- `self.kernel_params` is `None` (otherwise, the output would include its contents unless it was empty).

From scikit-learn, the kernels that use both `coef0` and `degree` are `'poly'` (polynomial kernel). So, `self.kernel` is likely `'poly'`.

Therefore, the input object should have:
- `kernel='poly'`
- `gamma=None` (since it's not in the output)
- `coef0=0.1`
- `degree=3.1`
- `kernel_params=None` (so the method starts with an empty dict)
- The rest of the parameters can be left as default or unspecified.
