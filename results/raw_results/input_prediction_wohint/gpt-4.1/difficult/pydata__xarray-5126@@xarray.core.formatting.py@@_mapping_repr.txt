[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `_mapping_repr` and the output.

The output is:
```
Attributes:
    foo:      bar
```

This means:
- The `title` argument is "Attributes".
- The mapping has a single key-value pair: "foo": "bar".
- The summarizer function produces the string `'    foo:      bar'` for the key-value pair.

Let's step through the function:

1. `col_width` is None, so `_calculate_col_width(mapping)` is called.
   - The mapping has one key: "foo". Its length is 3.
   - `_calculate_col_width` returns `max(3, 7) + 6 = 13`.

2. `max_rows` is None, so it is set to `OPTIONS['display_max_rows']`. But since the mapping has only one item, this doesn't matter.

3. `summary = ['Attributes:']`.

4. `if mapping:` is True (since mapping has one item).
   - `len_mapping = 1`.
   - `_get_boolean_with_default(expand_option_name, default=True)` is called. For the output to be expanded (not "Attributes: (1)"), this must return True.
   - `len_mapping > max_rows` is False (1 is not greater than max_rows).
   - So, we go to the `else` branch:
     - `summary += [summarizer(k, v, col_width) for k, v in mapping.items()]`
     - The output is `'    foo:      bar'`.

So, the mapping is `{"foo": "bar"}`.

The summarizer must be a function that, given key "foo", value "bar", and col_width 13, returns `'    foo:      bar'`.

The expand_option_name can be anything, as long as `_get_boolean_with_default` returns True (either the option is True, or 'default' and default=True).

col_width and max_rows are not passed, so they are None.

Therefore, the input is:
- mapping: {"foo": "bar"}
- title: "Attributes"
- summarizer: a function that produces `'    foo:      bar'` for ("foo", "bar", 13)
- expand_option_name: any string, e.g., "display_expand_attrs"
- col_width: None
- max_rows: None

The summarizer is likely `summarize_attr`, but since the output is `'    foo:      bar'`, let's check what it does.

But since the output is exactly as in the default, we can use the default summarizer for attributes.

So, the input is:

{
    "mapping": {"foo": "bar"},
    "title": "Attributes",
    "summarizer": summarize_attr,
    "expand_option_name": "display_expand_attrs",
    "col_width": null,
    "max_rows": null
}
