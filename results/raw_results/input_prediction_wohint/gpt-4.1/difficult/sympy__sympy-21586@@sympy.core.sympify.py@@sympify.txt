[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and the function step by step.

1. The output is:
```
{
    "_args_set": "{'2.00000000000000', '3'}"
}
```
This looks like the string representation of a Python set containing two strings: '2.00000000000000' and '3'.

2. The function `sympify(a, ...)` is designed to convert various types of input into a SymPy object, handling numbers, strings, iterables, numpy arrays, etc.

3. The output is not the direct result of `sympify`, but rather the string representation of a set of two strings. This suggests that the input to `sympify` was a set containing two elements: '2.00000000000000' and '3'.

4. Let's check how `sympify` would process such an input:
   - If `a` is iterable (which a set is), and not a string, it will try to return `type(a)([sympify(x, ...)])` for each element x in a.
   - So, if the input is `{'2.00000000000000', '3'}`, it will call `sympify('2.00000000000000')` and `sympify('3')`.
   - Both are strings representing numbers, so they will be parsed as numbers (SymPy Rationals or Floats), but when the set is constructed, their string representations will be as shown.

5. The output is the string representation of the set, not the set itself. This suggests that the code that produced the output did something like `str(sympify({'2.00000000000000', '3'}))`.

6. Therefore, the input to `sympify` was the set `{'2.00000000000000', '3'}`.

7. The other parameters (`locals`, `convert_xor`, `strict`, `rational`, `evaluate`) are not shown in the output, so we can assume they are default.
