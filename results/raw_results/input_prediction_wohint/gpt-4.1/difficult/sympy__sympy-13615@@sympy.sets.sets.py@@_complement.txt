The function in question is `Set._complement(self, other)`. The output is a FiniteSet with elements 10 and 15, as shown by the output: `"_elements": "frozenset({10, 15})"`.

Let's analyze how this could happen.

1. The output is a FiniteSet containing 10 and 15. This means the result of `_complement` is a FiniteSet with those elements.
2. Looking at the code for `_complement`, the only branch that returns a FiniteSet is the one for `elif isinstance(other, FiniteSet):`.
3. In that branch, the code does:
   - It uses `sift` to partition the elements of `other` according to whether `self.contains(el)` is True, False, or None.
   - It then returns `Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet)`.
   - If all elements are classified as False, then `sifted[False]` contains all elements, and `sifted[None]` is empty, so the result is just `FiniteSet(*sifted[False])`.

4. Therefore, for the output to be `FiniteSet(10, 15)`, we must have:
   - `other` is `FiniteSet(10, 15)`
   - For both 10 and 15, `self.contains(10)` and `self.contains(15)` must return False.

5. What could `self` be? It must be a set that does NOT contain 10 or 15. The simplest is the empty set.

6. In SymPy, the empty set is `S.EmptySet`.

7. So, the call is: `S.EmptySet._complement(FiniteSet(10, 15))`.

8. Let's check: `S.EmptySet._complement(FiniteSet(10, 15))` will call the `elif isinstance(other, FiniteSet):` branch, and for each element, `self.contains(el)` will be False (since the empty set contains nothing), so `sifted[False]` will be `{10, 15}` and `sifted[None]` will be empty. The result is `FiniteSet(10, 15)`.

Therefore, the input is:
- self: S.EmptySet
- other: FiniteSet(10, 15)
