[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `_encode_params(data)` is designed to encode parameters for HTTP requests.
2. If `data` is a string or bytes, it returns it as is. If it has a `.read` attribute, it returns it as is.
3. If it is iterable, it uses `to_key_val_list(data)` to convert it to a list of key-value pairs.
4. For each key-value pair, if the value is a string or not iterable, it wraps it in a list. Otherwise, it iterates over the value.
5. For each value, if it is not None, it encodes the key and value as utf-8 if they are strings, otherwise leaves them as is.
6. It then calls `urlencode(result, doseq=True)` to produce the final output.

Given the output: `"z=1&a=1&k=1&d=1"`

- This is a URL-encoded string with four key-value pairs: z=1, a=1, k=1, d=1.
- The order is z, a, k, d. This order is not alphabetical, so the input must be an ordered structure, such as a list of tuples or an OrderedDict.
- If the input was a dict, the order would not be guaranteed (unless it is Python 3.7+ where dicts are ordered, but the function uses `collections.Mapping` which could be OrderedDict).
- If the input was a list of tuples: `[('z', 1), ('a', 1), ('k', 1), ('d', 1)]`, the output would be as shown.

Let's check if any of the values are lists or iterables. In the output, each key appears only once, so each value is a single value, not a list.

Therefore, the input is likely a list of tuples: `[('z', 1), ('a', 1), ('k', 1), ('d', 1)]`.

Alternatively, it could be an OrderedDict with the same order.

But the most direct and minimal input is a list of tuples.
