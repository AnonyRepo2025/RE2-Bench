[THOUGHT]
The function Words2Numbers.text2int converts a string of number words into their integer representation as a string. The output is "32".

Let's consider how "32" could be written in words:
- "thirty two"
- "thirty-two" (hyphens are replaced with spaces in the code)
- "thirty and two" (the code allows "and" as a filler)

Let's check how the function processes "thirty two":
- "thirty" is in tens, mapped to (1, 30)
- "two" is in units, mapped to (1, 2)
- current = 0
- For "thirty": scale=1, increment=30 → current = 0*1 + 30 = 30
- For "two": scale=1, increment=2 → current = 30*1 + 2 = 32
- At the end, onnumber is True, so curstring += repr(result + current) → repr(0+32) = "32"

So, input "thirty two" produces output "32".

Alternatively, "thirty-two" would be converted to "thirty two" by the code.

Therefore, the input is likely "thirty two" (or "thirty-two").
