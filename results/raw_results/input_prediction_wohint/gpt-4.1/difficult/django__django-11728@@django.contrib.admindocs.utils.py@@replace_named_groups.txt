[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze what the function `replace_named_groups` does and how it transforms its input.

1. The function takes a regex pattern string as input.
2. It uses `named_group_matcher = re.compile('\\(\\?P(<\\w+>)')` to find named groups in the pattern. However, this regex is incorrect for Python's named group syntax. The correct syntax is `(?P<name>...)`, but this regex is looking for `(?P<name>)` (with the closing parenthesis immediately after the name), which is not how named groups are written. However, let's proceed as if it works for the intended input.
3. For each match, it tries to find the full group pattern and its name, then replaces the entire group pattern with just the group name in the pattern string.

Given the output is `"admin/password_change/done/"`, and the function returns the pattern with named groups replaced by their names, let's try to reverse-engineer the input.

- The output is a plain string, not a regex.
- The function only replaces named groups, so the input must have been a regex pattern with at least one named group, and after replacement, it became `"admin/password_change/done/"`.

So, the input must have been a regex pattern that matches `"admin/password_change/done/"` and contains a named group, which is replaced by its name, but in this case, the output is just the literal string.

But the function only replaces named groups with their names, so if the input was `"admin/password_change/done/"`, the output would be the same.

Alternatively, maybe the input was `"admin/password_change/done/"` (no named groups), so the function does nothing and returns the same string.

But let's check if there is a possible named group in the input that, after replacement, would result in `"admin/password_change/done/"`.

Suppose the input was `"admin/(?P<foo>password_change)/done/"`. The function would find the named group `(?P<foo>password_change)`, and replace it with `foo`, resulting in `"admin/foo/done/"`, which is not the output.

Alternatively, if the input was `"admin/password_change/done/"`, there are no named groups, so the output is the same.

Therefore, the only possible input is the same as the output: `"admin/password_change/done/"`.
