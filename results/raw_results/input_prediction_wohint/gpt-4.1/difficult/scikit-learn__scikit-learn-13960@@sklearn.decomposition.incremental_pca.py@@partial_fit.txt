[THOUGHT]
We are given the output state of an `IncrementalPCA` object after a call to `partial_fit`. We are to deduce the input to `partial_fit` that would result in this state.

Let's break down the output and the function logic:

1. **Parameters**:  
   - `n_components`: null (i.e., not set, so will be inferred from data)
   - `whiten`: false
   - `copy`: true
   - `batch_size`: "18" (string, but likely int in code)
   - `batch_size_`: "18" (so batch_size was set)
   - `n_components_`: 3 (so after fitting, the number of components is 3)
2. **State after partial_fit**:  
   - `components_`: 3x3 matrix (so input data must have at least 3 features, and at least 3 samples in the batch)
   - `n_samples_seen_`: 100 (so after this batch, total samples seen is 100)
   - `mean_`, `var_`: 3-element arrays (so input data has 3 features)
   - `singular_values_`, `explained_variance_`, `explained_variance_ratio_`: all 3 elements (matches n_components_)
   - `noise_variance_`: 0.0 (since n_components_ == n_features, so no leftover variance)
3. **How does `partial_fit` work?**
   - If `n_components` is None, it sets `n_components_` to min(n_samples, n_features) on the first call.
   - If `components_` is not None, it checks that its shape matches `n_components_`.
   - It updates mean/var/n_samples_seen_ using `_incremental_mean_and_var`.
   - If `n_samples_seen_ == 0`, it centers X by col_mean.
   - Otherwise, it does a more complex update (but in this case, n_samples_seen_ is 100 after the call, so before the call it was less).
4. **What was the input?**
   - The input to `partial_fit` is `X`, a 2D array with shape (n_samples, 3).
   - The batch size is 18, but `partial_fit` is called directly, so the batch size is just the number of rows in X.
   - After this call, `n_samples_seen_` is 100. That means before the call, it was less. If this is the first call, then the batch had 100 samples. If not, then the batch had (100 - previous n_samples_seen_) samples.
   - However, the logic in `partial_fit` sets `n_samples_seen_` to n_total_samples, which is the sum of previous and new samples. If this is the first call, previous n_samples_seen_ is 0, so n_total_samples = new_sample_count = n_samples in X.
   - So, likely, this is the first call, and X has shape (100, 3).

5. **What about the values?**
   - The mean and variance are given, so the data in X must have mean `[0.090962, -0.12025564, -0.02202145]` and variance `[0.98004322, 0.87276777, 1.009518]` (sample variance).
   - The SVD of the centered data gives the components_ and singular_values_ as shown.

6. **Summary**:
   - The input to `partial_fit` is a 2D numpy array X of shape (100, 3), with mean and variance as above.
   - The call is: `partial_fit(X)` where X is a (100, 3) array with the given mean/variance.
   - All other parameters are already set in the object.

7. **JSON input**:
   - "self": the IncrementalPCA object with the parameters as above, but before the call, its state is uninitialized (components_ = None, n_samples_seen_ = 0, etc.)
   - "args": X, a (100, 3) array with the given mean/variance.
   - "kwargs": none.

8. **Note**: The actual values of X are not uniquely determined, but any array with the given mean/variance and shape (100, 3) would work.
