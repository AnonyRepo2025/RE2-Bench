Let's analyze the function and the output.

The function is `Product._eval_product(term, limits)`. The output is `"2**\"Sum(2*f(k)\", (k, 1, n))"`. This is a string, but let's interpret it as a symbolic expression: \( 2^{\text{Sum}(2 f(k), (k, 1, n))} \).

Let's try to reverse-engineer what input would produce this output.

1. The function is a product over a term, with respect to a variable \( k \) from \( a \) to \( n \).
2. The output is an exponentiation: base 2, exponent is a sum: \( \sum_{k=1}^n 2 f(k) \).

From the code:
- If the term is a power, and the base does not depend on \( k \), then:
  ```
  if term.is_Pow:
      if not term.base.has(k):
          s = summation(term.exp, (k, a, n))
          return term.base ** s
  ```
  So, if the term is something like \( 2^{2 f(k)} \), then the product over \( k \) from 1 to \( n \) is \( 2^{\sum_{k=1}^n 2 f(k)} \).

Therefore, the input must be:
- term = \( 2^{2 f(k)} \)
- limits = (k, 1, n)

So, in JSON, we need to encode:
- term: 2**(2*f(k))
- limits: (k, 1, n)

Assuming the use of sympy, the input would be:
- term: sympy.Pow(2, 2*f(k))
- limits: (k, 1, n), where k = sympy.Symbol('k'), n = sympy.Symbol('n'), f = sympy.Function('f')

So, the input is:
{
    "term": 2**(2*f(k)),
    "limits": (k, 1, n)
}
