[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and the output.

The code reads four integers from input: H, W, A, B.

It then creates an HxW grid, initially filled with '0'.

The grid is filled as follows:
- For each cell (i, j):
    - If i < B:
        - If j < A: answer[i][j] = '0'
        - else: answer[i][j] = '1'
    - elif j < A: answer[i][j] = '1'
    - else: answer[i][j] = '0'

After filling, it prints each row as a string.

The output is a huge block of lines, each line is a string of 400 '1's, then at some point, the lines become strings of 400 '0's.

Let's check the structure of the output:
- The first lines are all '1's, then at some point, the lines become all '0's.
- The number of lines of '1's is 400, then the number of lines of '0's is 400.
- Each line is 400 characters long.

So, the output is a 800x400 grid, with the first 400 rows all '1's, the next 400 rows all '0's.

But let's check the code logic for this.

If i < B:
    - If j < A: answer[i][j] = '0'
    - else: answer[i][j] = '1'
elif j < A: answer[i][j] = '1'
else: answer[i][j] = '0'

But in the output, the first 400 rows are all '1's, so for i in 0..399, all answer[i][j] = '1'.

But in the code, for i < B, for j < A, answer[i][j] = '0', for j >= A, answer[i][j] = '1'.

So, for the first B rows, the first A columns are '0', the rest are '1'.

But in the output, the first 400 rows are all '1's, so A must be 0, so that for j < 0, which is never true, so answer[i][j] = '1' for all j.

Similarly, for the next rows (i >= B), for j < A, answer[i][j] = '1', else '0'. If A = 0, then for j < 0 is never true, so answer[i][j] = '0' for all j.

So, for i < B, all '1's; for i >= B, all '0's.

So, the output is H = 800, W = 400, A = 0, B = 400.

Let's check: for i in 0..399, all '1's; for i in 400..799, all '0's.

Yes, matches the output.

So, the input is H = 800, W = 400, A = 0, B = 400.

The input format is four integers, separated by spaces or newlines.

So, the input is:
800 400 0 400
