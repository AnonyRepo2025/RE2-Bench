[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `_matrix_derivative` and the output.

1. The output is a dictionary with keys: `_rows`, `_cols`, and `_mat`, with values 2, 2, and null, respectively. This matches the internal structure of a 2x2 matrix in SymPy, specifically an `ImmutableDenseMatrix` (or similar).

2. The function `_matrix_derivative(expr, x)` computes the matrix derivative of `expr` with respect to `x`. The result is a matrix, and the output shows a 2x2 matrix.

3. The only way for the output to be a 2x2 matrix with `_mat` as null (which likely means all entries are zero or the matrix is uninitialized) is if the derivative of the input matrix with respect to the variable is a zero matrix.

4. Let's consider what input would produce this:
   - If `expr` is a 2x2 matrix of constants (no dependence on `x`), then the derivative with respect to `x` is a 2x2 zero matrix.
   - If `x` is a symbol not present in `expr`, the derivative is also zero.

5. Therefore, the input must be:
   - `expr`: a 2x2 constant matrix (e.g., `ImmutableDenseMatrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`)
   - `x`: a symbol not present in the matrix (e.g., `x = Symbol('x')`)

6. The function signature is `_matrix_derivative(expr, x)`, so the input JSON should specify these.

7. The output does not show the actual matrix values, just the shape, so any constant 2x2 matrix will do.

8. The input should be:
   - `expr`: a 2x2 matrix of constants (e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
   - `x`: a symbol, say "x"
