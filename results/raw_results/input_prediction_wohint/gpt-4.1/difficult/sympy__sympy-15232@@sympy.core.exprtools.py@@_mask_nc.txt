[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `_mask_nc` and the output.

The output is:
```
[
    "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n",
    null,
    null
]
```
So, the function returned a tuple of three elements:
1. The first is the string "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n"
2. The second is null (i.e., None)
3. The third is null (i.e., None)

From the code:
- If `expr.is_commutative`, the function returns `(eq, {}, [])`
- Otherwise, it does a lot of work to mask non-commutative objects.

But in the output, the second and third elements are None, not `{}` and `[]`. However, in the code, if the dictionary is empty, it returns `None` (because of `or None`), and if the list is empty, it returns `None` (because of `or None`).

So, the function returned early at:
```python
if expr.is_commutative:
    return (eq, {}, [])
```
But then, in the return, it is actually:
```python
return (expr, {v: k for k, v in rep} or None, nc_syms)
```
So if `rep` is empty, `{v: k for k, v in rep}` is `{}` which is falsy, so `or None` makes it `None`. Similarly, `nc_syms` is `[]`, so `or None` makes it `None`.

Therefore, the input expression must be commutative.

Also, the first element is the string "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n". This is the string representation of the input expression.

So, the input must be an expression whose string representation is "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n", and which is commutative.

In SymPy, by default, symbols are commutative unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the input is:
- eq: sympy expression: x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n
- name: not specified (so default None)

So, the input is:
{
    "eq": x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n
}

In JSON, we can't represent SymPy expressions directly, but in the context of this problem, we can use a string and assume it will be sympified.

So, the input is:
{
    "eq": "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n"
}
