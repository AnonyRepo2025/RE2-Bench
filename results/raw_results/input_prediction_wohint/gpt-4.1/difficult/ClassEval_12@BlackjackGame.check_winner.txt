[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the logic of the `check_winner` function.

First, it calculates the hand values for both player and dealer using `calculate_hand_value`.

Then, the winner is determined as follows:
- If both player and dealer are over 21:
    - If player_value <= dealer_value: "Player wins"
    - else: "Dealer wins"
- If only player is over 21: "Dealer wins"
- If only dealer is over 21: "Player wins"
- If both are 21 or less:
    - If player_value <= dealer_value: "Dealer wins"
    - else: "Player wins"

We want the output to be "Player wins".

So, let's enumerate the cases where "Player wins" is returned:
1. Both player and dealer are over 21, and player_value <= dealer_value.
2. Only dealer is over 21.
3. Both are 21 or less, and player_value > dealer_value.

Let's pick the simplest: both are 21 or less, and player_value > dealer_value.

Let's construct an example:
- player_hand: ["10H", "9D"] (10 + 9 = 19)
- dealer_hand: ["8C", "9S"] (8 + 9 = 17)

19 > 17, both <= 21, so "Player wins".

Alternatively, let's check the "dealer busts" case:
- player_hand: ["10H", "7D"] (17)
- dealer_hand: ["10C", "9S", "5H"] (10 + 9 + 5 = 24 > 21)

Dealer is over 21, so "Player wins".

Either is valid, but the first is simpler.

So, the input should be:
- player_hand: ["10H", "9D"]
- dealer_hand: ["8C", "9S"]
