[THOUGHT]
The function process_csv_data(N, save_file_name) does the following:
1. Reads a CSV file named save_file_name.
2. Gets the header (title) and data (rows).
3. Extracts the N-th column from each row, uppercases each value, and creates a new data structure: [title, column_data].
4. Writes this new data to a file named save_file_name with '_process.csv' appended before the extension.
5. Returns 1 if writing is successful, 0 otherwise.

Given the output is 1, the write_csv call succeeded. The function is deterministic and only returns 1 or 0 based on file writing.

Since the output is 1, the only requirements are:
- The file save_file_name exists and is readable.
- The N-th column exists in each row.
- The file can be written to.

The actual values of N and save_file_name are not constrained by the output alone, as long as the above conditions are met. However, to provide a concrete input, let's assume a typical case:
- N = 0 (first column)
- save_file_name = "data.csv"

This is a minimal, plausible input that would produce output 1 if the file exists and is formatted correctly.

No kwargs are used.
