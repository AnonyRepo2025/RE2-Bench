[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and work backwards to deduce the input.

The function signature is:
def encode_cf_datetime(dates, units=None, calendar=None):

The output is:
[
    "10",
    "days since 2000-01-01",
    "gregorian"
]

So, the function returned:
num = 10
units = "days since 2000-01-01"
calendar = "gregorian"

Let's break down how this could happen.

1. The function first converts dates to a numpy array.
2. If units is None, it infers units from the dates. If calendar is None, it infers calendar from the dates.
3. It unpacks the units into delta and ref_date. Here, delta = "days", ref_date = "2000-01-01".
4. It checks if the calendar is standard (gregorian is standard).
5. It asserts that dates.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]'.
6. It computes time_delta = np.timedelta64(1, 'D').astype('timedelta64[ns]') = 1 day in ns.
7. ref_date = pd.Timestamp("2000-01-01")
8. dates_as_index = pd.DatetimeIndex(dates.ravel())
9. time_deltas = dates_as_index - ref_date
10. If all time_deltas are integer multiples of time_delta, num = time_deltas // time_delta

We get num = 10. That means the input date is 10 days after 2000-01-01, i.e., 2010-01-11? Wait, let's check:

2000-01-01 + 10 days = 2000-01-11

But let's check the type: the function expects dates to be a numpy array of dtype 'datetime64[ns]'.

So, the input must be:
dates = np.array(['2000-01-11'], dtype='datetime64[ns]')
units = "days since 2000-01-01"
calendar = "gregorian"

But, the function will infer units and calendar if not provided. Since the output units and calendar match the input, it's likely that units and calendar were not provided (i.e., None).

So, the input is:
dates = np.array(['2000-01-11'], dtype='datetime64[ns]')
units = None
calendar = None

Alternatively, the input could be a list or a scalar, but the function will convert it to a numpy array anyway.

Therefore, the input is:
dates = np.datetime64('2000-01-11')
units = None
calendar = None

Or, as a list:
dates = [np.datetime64('2000-01-11')]
units = None
calendar = None

Either is acceptable, but the most canonical is a numpy array.
