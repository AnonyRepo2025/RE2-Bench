[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function `factor_terms` is a recursive simplifier/factorizer for symbolic expressions, and `do` is its inner recursive function. The output is a string representation of a symbolic expression: 
   ```
   (-1 + "sqrt(3)"*I)*("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3)
   ```
   Let's parse this as a SymPy expression:
   - The outermost structure is a multiplication: `(-1 + sqrt(3)*I)` times `("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3)`.
   - `"sqrt(3)"*I` is the imaginary unit times the square root of 3.
   - `("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3)` is the cube root of (sqrt(21) + 5).

2. The function `do` is called recursively on subexpressions. The input to `do` must be an expression that, after factoring, produces the above output.

3. Let's try to reverse-engineer what input would produce this output after factoring.

4. The output is already factored as a product of two terms. If we expand this, we get:
   ```
   [(-1) + sqrt(3)*I] * (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
   ```
   If we expand this, we get:
   ```
   (-1)*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
   ```
   Or:
   ```
   - (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
   ```
   Or:
   ```
   [sqrt(3)*I - 1] * (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
   ```

5. So, the input to `do` could be the expanded form:
   ```
   - (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
   ```
   Or, more generally, an Add of two terms:
   ```
   Add(- (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3), sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3))
   ```

6. The function `do` will factor out the common factor `(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)` from both terms, and write the result as:
   ```
   [sqrt(3)*I - 1] * (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
   ```

7. Therefore, the input to `do` is:
   ```
   - (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
   ```

8. In SymPy, this would be:
   ```
   Add(-Pow(Add(sqrt(21), 5), Rational(1, 3)), Mul(sqrt(3), I, Pow(Add(sqrt(21), 5), Rational(1, 3))))
   ```

9. In JSON, we can represent the input as a string (since the output is a string), or as a SymPy expression tree. For this problem, let's use the string representation.

10. So, the input is:
   ```
   - (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
   ```
