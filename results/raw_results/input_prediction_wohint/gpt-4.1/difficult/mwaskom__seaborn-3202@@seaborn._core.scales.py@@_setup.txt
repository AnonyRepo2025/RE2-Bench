Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function is `Nominal._setup(self, data: Series, prop: Property, axis: Axis | None=None) -> Scale`.

2. The output is a dictionary with the following keys and values:
   - "values": null
   - "order": null
   - "_tick_params": {"locator": null}
   - "_label_params": {"formatter": null}
   - "_legend": [null, null]
   - "_matplotlib_scale": {}
   - "_pipeline": null
   - "_spacer": {}

3. Let's map these to the state of the `Nominal` object after calling `_setup`.

4. The function starts by copying `self` to `new`. Then, if `new._tick_params` is None, it calls `new.tick()`. If `new._label_params` is None, it calls `new.label()`. In the output, both `_tick_params` and `_label_params` are not None, but their subfields are null. This suggests that the input `self` already had `_tick_params` and `_label_params` set, but their subfields (`locator`, `formatter`) are None.

5. The function then creates `units_seed = categorical_order(data, new.order)`. If `data` is None or empty, `units_seed` will be empty or None.

6. The function then creates a `CatScale` and assigns it to `mpl_scale`. It also creates an axis if `axis` is None.

7. It then calls `axis.update_units(stringify(np.array(units_seed)))`. If `units_seed` is None or empty, this will be an empty array.

8. The function defines `convert_units` and `spacer`, and sets `new._pipeline` and `new._spacer`.

9. If `prop.legend` is True, it sets `new._legend = (units_seed, list(stringify(units_seed)))`. Otherwise, `_legend` is not set.

10. In the output, `_legend` is [null, null], which suggests that `units_seed` is None or empty.

11. `_matplotlib_scale` is an empty dict, which suggests that the scale object is not fully initialized or is a dummy.

12. `_pipeline` is null, which suggests that the pipeline was not set, possibly because `data` is None or empty.

13. `_spacer` is an empty dict, which suggests that the spacer function was not set.

14. "values" and "order" are null, which suggests that the input `self` had these as None.

15. Therefore, the input must have been:
    - self: a Nominal object with values=None, order=None, _tick_params={"locator": None}, _label_params={"formatter": None}, _legend=[None, None], _matplotlib_scale={}, _pipeline=None, _spacer={}
    - data: None or an empty Series
    - prop: a Property object with legend=False (since _legend is not set to anything meaningful)
    - axis: None

16. Since the function expects a Series for data, the most likely input is an empty Series.

17. The Property object should have legend=False, so that the _legend is not set.

18. The axis is None.

19. The self object has all fields as None or empty as in the output.
