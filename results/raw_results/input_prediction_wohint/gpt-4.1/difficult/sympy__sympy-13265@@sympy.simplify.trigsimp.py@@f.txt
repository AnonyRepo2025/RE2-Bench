[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `f` inside `exptrigsimp`. The function `f` is applied to an expression `rv` (which is the result of a previous transformation, but in this context, we only care about what input to `f` would produce the output `"exp(2*I*x) + 1"`).

First, note that `f` checks if `rv.is_Mul`. If not, it returns `rv` unchanged. If it is a multiplication, it tries to do some transformations.

But in our output, the result is `"exp(2*I*x) + 1"`, which is an addition, not a multiplication. That means that the input to `f` must be an expression that, when passed to `f`, is not a multiplication, so `f` will just return it unchanged.

Therefore, the input to `f` must be the same as the output: `exp(2*I*x) + 1`.

In SymPy, this would be constructed as `exp(2*I*x) + 1`, where `x` is a symbol.

So, the input to `f` is:
- `rv = exp(2*I*x) + 1`

Assuming the context, `x` is a symbol, and `exp`, `I` are from SymPy.
