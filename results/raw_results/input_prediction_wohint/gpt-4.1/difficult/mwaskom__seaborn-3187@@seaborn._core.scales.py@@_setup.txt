[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output to deduce the input.

1. The function is `ContinuousBase._setup(self, data: Series, prop: Property, axis: Axis | None=None) -> Scale`.
2. The output is a dictionary representing the state of the object after `_setup` is called. The key fields are:
   - "values": null
   - "norm": null
   - "trans": "log"
   - "_tick_params": {...}
   - "_label_params": {...}
   - "_legend": null
   - "_priority": 0
   - "_matplotlib_scale": {...}
   - "_pipeline": null
   - "_spacer": {}

3. The function does the following:
   - Copies self.
   - Ensures tick and label params are set.
   - Gets forward/inverse transforms.
   - Gets a matplotlib scale object.
   - If axis is None, creates a PseudoAxis.
   - Sets up locators/formatters.
   - If prop.normed, sets up normalization.
   - Sets up a pipeline.
   - Sets up a spacer function.
   - If prop.legend, sets up legend.

4. The output shows:
   - "norm": null, so `self.norm` was None and `prop.normed` was False or not set.
   - "_legend": null, so `prop.legend` was False or not set.
   - "_pipeline": null, so the pipeline was not set up, likely because `prop.normed` is False.
   - "_matplotlib_scale": present, so the scale was set up.
   - "trans": "log", so the scale is logarithmic.

5. To get this output:
   - The input `self` must be a `ContinuousBase` instance with `trans="log"`, `norm=None`, `_tick_params` and `_label_params` set to the shown values, and other fields as shown.
   - The input `data` can be any pandas Series (the function only uses min/max if `prop.normed` is True).
   - The input `prop` must be a Property with `normed=False` and `legend=False` (or default values).
   - The input `axis` is likely None (since the function creates a PseudoAxis if axis is None).

6. The output is the state of the object after calling `_setup`. Since "norm" and "_legend" are null, and "_pipeline" is null, the key is that `prop.normed` and `prop.legend` are both False.

7. The "values" field is null, which suggests that the input data is not used to set this field (or it's not set in this function).

8. The "_matplotlib_scale" is present, so the function did create a scale object.

Summary:
- self: ContinuousBase instance with trans="log", norm=None, _tick_params and _label_params as shown, etc.
- data: any pandas Series (e.g., pd.Series([1,2,3]), name can be anything)
- prop: Property with normed=False, legend=False
- axis: None
