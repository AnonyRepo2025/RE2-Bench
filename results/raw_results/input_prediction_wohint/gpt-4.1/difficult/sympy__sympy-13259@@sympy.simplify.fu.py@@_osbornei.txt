[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `_osbornei(e, d)` and the output.

1. The function `_osbornei(e, d)` takes an expression `e` and a symbol `d`. It defines a function `f(rv)` that, if `rv` is a TrigonometricFunction, rewrites it in terms of hyperbolic functions using a specific substitution. Then it applies `bottom_up(e, f)`, which recursively applies `f` to all subexpressions of `e`.

2. The output is `"2*tanh(x)"`. This is a hyperbolic function, specifically `2 * tanh(x)`.

3. The only way `_osbornei` produces hyperbolic functions is by transforming trigonometric functions. Let's look at the mapping:
   - sin(a) → sinh(a)/I
   - cos(a) → cosh(a)
   - tan(a) → tanh(a)/I
   - cot(a) → coth(a)*I
   - sec(a) → sech(a)
   - csc(a) → csch(a)*I

4. Our output is `2*tanh(x)`. The only mapping that produces `tanh` is `tan(a) → tanh(a)/I`. But our output is not divided by `I`, so perhaps the input is `2*I*tan(x)`, because:
   - tan(x) → tanh(x)/I
   - I*tan(x) → I*(tanh(x)/I) = tanh(x)
   - 2*I*tan(x) → 2*tanh(x)

5. Therefore, the input expression `e` is `2*I*tan(x)`, and the variable `d` is `x`.

6. The function uses `sympy` expressions, so the input should be a sympy expression, not a string.

7. The JSON input should represent the call: `_osbornei(2*I*tan(x), x)`

8. In JSON, we can represent this as:
   - "e": "2*I*tan(x)"
   - "d": "x"
