[THOUGHT]
We are told that the output of `contravariant_order(expr)` is 2.

Let's analyze the function step by step to deduce what kind of input would produce this output.

1. The function checks the type of `expr`:
   - If `Add`: returns the order of each argument, but all must be the same.
   - If `Mul`: returns 0 if all orders are 0, else returns the nonzero order (if only one).
   - If `Pow`: returns 0 unless the base or exp is covariant (then error).
   - If `BaseVectorField`: returns 1.
   - If `TensorProduct`: returns the sum of the contravariant orders of its arguments.
   - If not _strict or expr.atoms(BaseScalarField): returns 0.
   - Else: returns -1.

2. To get output 2, the only way is for the function to return 2. Let's see which branch can do that:
   - `BaseVectorField` returns 1.
   - `TensorProduct` returns the sum of the contravariant orders of its arguments.

So, if we have a `TensorProduct` of two `BaseVectorField` objects, each will return 1, and the sum will be 2.

Alternatively, a `TensorProduct` of one object with order 2 (e.g., a `TensorProduct` of two `BaseVectorField`s) and another with order 0 (e.g., a scalar) would also sum to 2.

But the simplest is: `TensorProduct(BaseVectorField(), BaseVectorField())`.

Therefore, the input should be a `TensorProduct` of two `BaseVectorField` objects.

Assuming the function is called as `contravariant_order(expr)`, the input is:
- expr = TensorProduct(BaseVectorField(), BaseVectorField())
