[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `fraction` and the output.

The function `fraction(expr, exact=False)` takes an expression and returns a tuple (numerator, denominator), both as sympy expressions (or their string representations in the output).

Given the output:
```
{
    "output": [
        "-x**3",
        "1"
    ]
}
```
This means the numerator is `-x**3` and the denominator is `1`.

Let's see how the function could produce this.

1. The function first sympifies the input.
2. It then iterates over the arguments of the input, as returned by `Mul.make_args(expr)`.
3. For each term, it checks if it's a power or exp, and whether the exponent is negative, positive, etc.
4. If the term is a rational, it splits numerator and denominator.
5. Otherwise, it adds to the numerator.

If the output is `-x**3` and `1`, that means the input, after sympification, is just `-x**3` (i.e., negative x cubed), and there is no denominator.

Let's check what happens if we call `fraction(-x**3)`:

- sympify(-x**3) is just -x**3.
- Mul.make_args(-x**3) will return (-1, x**3).
- For -1: it's an integer, so n, d = -1, 1; numer.append(-1), denom.append(1).
- For x**3: it's a power, exponent is positive, so numer.append(x**3).
- So numer = [-1, x**3], denom = [1].
- At the end, Mul(*numer) = -x**3, Mul(*denom) = 1.

So the input is `-x**3`.

Alternatively, if the input was something like `(-x)**3`, that would also be `-x**3`.

If the input was `-1*x**3`, that would also be `-x**3`.

If the input was `(-x**3)/1`, that would also be `-x**3, 1`.

But the function is designed to split out denominators, so if the denominator is 1, the input is just `-x**3`.

Therefore, the input is `-x**3`.

The function also has an `exact` parameter, but the default is `False`, and the output matches the default behavior.

So, the input is:
- expr: "-x**3"
- exact: (not specified, so default False)
