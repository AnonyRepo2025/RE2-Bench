[THOUGHT]
The code splits the input into two strings a and b, then reverses b, converts both to integers, and prints their sum:
  result = int(a) + int(b[::-1])

We need int(a) + int(reverse(b)) = 1219362194.

There are infinitely many (a, b) pairs satisfying this. A clean choice is to set reverse(b) = a, so that
  result = a + a = 2·a
Hence a = 1219362194 / 2 = 609681097.

Then b must be the reverse of "609681097", which is "790186906".

So the input string "609681097 790186906" yields:
  a = "609681097"
  b[::-1] = "609681097"
  sum = 609681097 + 609681097 = 1219362194
