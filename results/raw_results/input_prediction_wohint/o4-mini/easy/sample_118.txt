[THOUGHT]
We need f(text, chars) to return "zbzquiuqnmfkx".  
f does two passes where it builds up extra_chars and removes all occurrences of extra_chars from text.  

If we choose chars = "" then:
- extra_chars = "" + "" â†’ ""  
- text.replace("", "") does nothing (replacing the empty string with empty string leaves text unchanged)
This happens identically in both passes, so the function just returns the original text.  

Therefore the simplest solution is to pass text = "zbzquiuqnmfkx" and chars = "" so that no removal ever happens and the output matches exactly.
