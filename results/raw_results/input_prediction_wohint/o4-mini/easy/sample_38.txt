[THOUGHT]
We know f(string) returns string.title().replace(' ', '').  
The output is "1Oe-Err-Bzz-Bmm".  
.title() capitalizes the first letter of each word (words split on non-alphanumeric like hyphens), lowercases the rest, and leaves separators like '-' intact.  
.replace(' ', '') then removes spaces (of which there are none in the output).  

We need an input which, when title-cased, yields "1Oe-Err-Bzz-Bmm".  
Taking "1oe-err-bzz-bmm".title() gives:
 - "1oe" → "1Oe"  
 - "err" → "Err"  
 - "bzz" → "Bzz"  
 - "bmm" → "Bmm"  
Joined with hyphens: "1Oe-Err-Bzz-Bmm".  
No spaces are introduced, so replace(' ', '') does nothing further.  

Therefore the original input string was "1oe-err-bzz-bmm".
