[THOUGHT]
We need a data array whose population variance (np.var with ddof=0) rounds to 1.25.  
For data = [1, 2, 3, 4]:
  mean = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5  
  squared deviations = (1.5², 0.5², 0.5², 1.5²) = (2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25)  
  mean of these = (2.25+0.25+0.25+2.25)/4 = 5/4 = 1.25  
Rounding to two decimals remains 1.25, matching the output.
