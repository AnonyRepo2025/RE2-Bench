[THOUGHT]
The function does:
1. text.split(',') â†’ list0
2. pop(0) removes list0[0], leaving list1_raw
3. find the first 'T' in list1_raw, pop it and insert at front
4. return 'T,' + join of the final list

Given output "T,T,Sspp,G ,.tB,Vxk,Cct", splitting on commas gives ['T','T','Sspp','G  ','.tB','Vxk','Cct']. The leading 'T,' is the fixed prefix; the joined list must be ['T','Sspp','G  ','.tB','Vxk','Cct'] after rearrangement.

If in list1_raw the 'T' was already at index 0, the pop/insert is a no-op. So list1_raw = ['T','Sspp','G  ','.tB','Vxk','Cct'].

That means before popping the very first element, list0 must have been something like ['X','T','Sspp','G  ','.tB','Vxk','Cct'] for some dummy X. Splitting "X,T,Sspp,G ,.tB,Vxk,Cct" on commas gives exactly that, pop(0) removes 'X', leaving our list1_raw, then the 'T' move does nothing, and we get the desired output.

We can choose X arbitrarily; for clarity pick "X".
