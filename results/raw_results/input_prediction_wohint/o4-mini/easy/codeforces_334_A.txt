[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer n and sets i = 1, j = n*n. It prints pairs (i, j) while i < j, incrementing i and decrementing j each time.

The first printed line is “1 100”, so j starts at 100 ⇒ n*n = 100 ⇒ n = 10.

With n = 10, j = 100 and after 50 iterations (i from 1 to 50, j from 100 down to 51) it prints “50 51” then stops when i becomes 51 and j 50. This exactly matches the output.
