[THOUGHT]
The output has exactly one space before each fragment ("f9", "ldf9", "adf9!", "f9?").  
In Python, str.expandtabs(n) replaces each '\t' with enough spaces to reach the next multiple of n columns.  
If tabsize=1, each '\t' at the start of the line becomes exactly 1 space.  
Thus, to get " f9" etc., the input lines must each start with '\t'.  
So the original text is "\tf9\n\tldf9\n\tadf9!\n\tf9?" and tabsize is 1.
