[THOUGHT]
The function `f` counts non‐overlapping occurrences of `part` in `full`. To get an output of 2, we need exactly two sequential non‐overlapping matches.

For example, let full = "testtest" and part = "test":
1. find "test" at index 0 → slice full to "test", count = 1
2. find "test" at index 0 in the new full → slice full to "", count = 2
3. find returns -1 → exit loop, return 2

Thus with full="testtest" and part="test", `f` returns 2.
