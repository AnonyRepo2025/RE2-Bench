[THOUGHT]
The method text.ljust(len(text) + 1, '#') pads the original text on the right with '#' characters until its total length is one more than the original. That means it appends exactly one '#' to the end of the input text.  
Given the output "the cow goes moo#", the original text must be that string without its final '#'.  
So text = "the cow goes moo".
