[THOUGHT]
The function `f` returns all alphanumeric characters from the input `text` in order. Given the output `"we32r71g72ug94823658324"`, the input must contain this exact sequence of alphanumeric characters. The simplest such input is the string itself, since it has no non-alphanumeric characters to remove.
