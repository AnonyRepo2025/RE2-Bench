[THOUGHT]
The function begins by calling `nums.clear()`, which empties the list in-place. The subsequent `for num in nums:` loop therefore iterates over an empty list, so no elements are appended. The function thus always returns an empty list, regardless of the original contents of `nums`. The simplest possible input that yields `[]` is an empty list.
