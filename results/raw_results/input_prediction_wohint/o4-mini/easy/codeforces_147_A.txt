[THOUGHT]
We need an input string s which, after inserting exactly one space after each punctuation in `t = ',.?!'`, normalizing whitespace, and then removing any space before punctuation, yields
“physicist? mathematician. astronomer”.

A minimal source is to start with no spaces around punctuation:
“physicist?mathematician.astronomer”

Step 1: replace each ‘?’ with ‘? ’ ⇒ “physicist? mathematician.astronomer”
Step 2: replace each ‘.’ with ‘. ’ ⇒ “physicist? mathematician. astronomer”
(No commas or exclamations to process.)
Step 3: collapse whitespace – no change.
Step 4: remove any space before punctuation – no change.

This matches the given output exactly.[INPUT]
```
{
    "input": "physicist?mathematician.astronomer"
}
```
