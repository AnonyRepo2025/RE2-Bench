[THOUGHT]
The function `f(a,b,n)` strips out the first `n` occurrences of substring `b` from `a`, then returns the resulting string.

We need `f(a,b,n) == "unrndqafi"`.

A simple choice is to let `b = "u"` and `n = 1`, so that only the very first `"u"` in `a` is removed. To end up with `"unrndqafi"`, the original `a` must have been `"uunrndqafi"` (so that removing the first `"u"` yields `"unrndqafi"`).

Thus:
- a = "uunrndqafi"
- b = "u"
- n = 1
