[THOUGHT]
We need an initial list `nums` that, when processed by the function, ends up as [5,3,3,7]. The function iterates `i` from `len(nums)-2` down to 0, and whenever `nums[i]` is even, it does `nums.remove(nums[i])`, which removes the first occurrence of that even value.

We want to remove all evens and keep the odds [5,3,3,7] in that relative order. A simple candidate is:

nums = [2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 7]

Simulate:
- Start with [2,5,4,3,3,7], length=6, so i goes 4,3,2,1,0.
i=4: nums[4]=3 (odd) → no change
i=3: nums[3]=3 (odd) → no change
i=2: nums[2]=4 (even) → remove first 4 → [2,5,3,3,7]
i=1: nums[1]=5 (odd) → no change
i=0: nums[0]=2 (even) → remove first 2 → [5,3,3,7]

Result matches. So the input must have been `{"nums": [2,5,4,3,3,7]}`.
