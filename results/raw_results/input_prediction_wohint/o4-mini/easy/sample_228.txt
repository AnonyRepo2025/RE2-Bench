[THOUGHT]
The function does:  
1. text.lower().split() → a list of lowercase words from the original text.  
2. splitter.join(that list) → the output string.  

Given the output "llthh#saflapkphtswp":  
- There is exactly one '#' in the result, so splitter must be "#" and the list must have two elements.  
- Splitting the output on "#" yields ["llthh", "saflapkphtswp"].  
- Therefore text.lower().split() must have produced ["llthh", "saflapkphtswp"].  
- A minimal original text whose lowercase split gives that is "llthh saflapkphtswp".  

Hence the inputs are:
text = "llthh saflapkphtswp"  
splitter = "#"
