[THOUGHT]
We need f(text, froms) to return "1co". The function does:
1. text = text.lstrip(froms): strips any leading characters found in the set of `froms`.
2. text = text.rstrip(froms): strips any trailing characters in `froms`.

Hence the core substring "1co" must occur in the original `text`, possibly surrounded by characters that are all in `froms`. A minimal choice is:
- froms = "0"
- text = "01co0"

Simulation:
- "01co0".lstrip("0") → "1co0"
- "1co0".rstrip("0") → "1co"

This matches the desired output.
