[THOUGHT]
The function f(text, use) returns text.replace(use, '').  
We see the output is  
"Chris requires  ride to the irport on Fridy."  
Notice that removing all letters "a" from  
"Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday."  
yields exactly that:  
- "a" after "requires" is removed, leaving two spaces before "ride".  
- "airport" becomes "irport".  
- "Friday" becomes "Fridy".  
Hence the original text must have been "Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday." and use must be "a".
