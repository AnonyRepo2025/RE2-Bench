[THOUGHT]
We have f(array):
1. result = array.copy()
2. result.reverse()  # now result is the original array in reverse order
3. result[:] = [item * 2 for item in result]  # each element doubled
4. return result

Given output = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2], this is the reversed original array with each element doubled. Let original = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]. After reverse we get [x5, x4, x3, x2, x1], after doubling [2*x5, 2*x4, 2*x3, 2*x2, 2*x1] = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]. So
2*x5 = 10 → x5 = 5
2*x4 = 8  → x4 = 4
2*x3 = 6  → x3 = 3
2*x2 = 4  → x2 = 2
2*x1 = 2  → x1 = 1

So the original input array must have been [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
