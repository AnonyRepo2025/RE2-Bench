[THOUGHT]
1. The method simply delegates to get_random_string(length, allowed_chars).  
2. The output has length 10, so the default `length=10` must have been used.  
3. The output characters are drawn from the default `allowed_chars`.  
4. No custom arguments were passed, so `args` is empty and `kwargs` is empty, relying on the default parameter values.
