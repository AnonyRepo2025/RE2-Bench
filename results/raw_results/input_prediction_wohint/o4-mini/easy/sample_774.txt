[THOUGHT]
The format string is `'quiz leader = {}, count = {}'`, and `format(name, num)` fills the first `{}` with `name` and the second with `num`.  
Given the output `"quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23"`, we see that:
- `name` must be `"Cornareti"` (to fill the first placeholder),
- `num` must be `23` (to fill the second placeholder).

Therefore, the function was called with `num = 23` and `name = "Cornareti"`.
