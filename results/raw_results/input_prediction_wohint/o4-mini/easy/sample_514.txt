[THOUGHT]
We need an input string `text` such that f(text) → "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."  
Inside f, for each whitespace‐separated token `item`, it does  
  text = text.replace('-'+item, ' ').replace(item+'-', ' ')  
then finally strips leading/trailing hyphens.  

If we choose text exactly equal to "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.",  
the two tokens are  
  1. "stew---corn-and-beans-in"  
  2. "soup-."  
Neither "-stew---corn-and-beans-in" nor "stew---corn-and-beans-in-" occurs in the string, nor similarly for "soup-.", so no replacements happen.  
Then strip('-') removes only leading/trailing hyphens—but there are none at the very ends—so the output remains identical.  

Hence the simplest input is exactly the given output string.
