[THOUGHT]
The function pads the string `num` with leading zeros until its length equals `l`. The result `"001"` can be obtained if `num = "1"` and `l = 3`:
- len("1") = 1, and 3 > 1, so one '0' is added (now t = "0", l decremented to 2).
- 2 > 1, so another '0' is added (now t = "00", l decremented to 1).
- 1 > 1 is false, so the loop stops and returns `"00" + "1" = "001"`.
This is the simplest input producing the output `"001"`.
