[THOUGHT]
The `insert_coin` method adds the given `amount` to the machine’s `balance` (which starts at 0) and returns the new balance. We see the output is 6.25, so the amount passed in must have been 6.25, since 0 + amount = 6.25. The machine’s initial state has an empty `inventory` and a `balance` of 0.
