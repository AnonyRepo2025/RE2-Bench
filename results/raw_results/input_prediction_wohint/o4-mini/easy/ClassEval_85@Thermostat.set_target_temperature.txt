[THOUGHT]
The method `set_target_temperature` only assigns to `self.target_temperature` and returns `None`, which is serialized as `null` in JSON. Seeing an output of `null` tells us the call succeeded but gives no further clues about the actual values. We must therefore supply a plausible thermostat state (`self`) and a new target temperature (`temperature`).  

For example, if the thermostat was at a current temperature of 20, had a previous target of 25 in “cool” mode, and we call `set_target_temperature` with 22, the method returns `None` (JSON `null`).
