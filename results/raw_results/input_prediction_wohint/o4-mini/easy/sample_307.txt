[THOUGHT]
Let the input text be of length n. The function converts it to a list of n chars, then for each i in 1..n–2, inserts a '|' at position i+1. That adds (n–2) pipes, giving total length n + (n–2) = 2n–2.

The given output "px|||||cznyf" has length 12, so 2n–2 = 12 ⇒ n = 7. The process inserts the pipes between the second character and the remaining tail:

After all insertions, the pattern is:
  [c0, c1] + 5 pipes + [c2, c3, c4, c5, c6] = "px|||||cznyf"

Thus c0='p', c1='x', and the tail "cznyf" must be c2–c6. Hence the input text is "pxcznyf".
