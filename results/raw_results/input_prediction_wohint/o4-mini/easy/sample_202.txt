[THOUGHT]
The function extends `array` with `list` and then returns all elements of the (mutated) `array` that are ≥ 10. To get an output of [15, 15], the combined array must contain exactly two 15’s (and any other elements <10 wouldn’t show up in the result). The simplest choice is to start with an empty `array` and a `list` containing [15, 15]. Extending an empty array yields [15, 15], and filtering for ≥10 gives [15, 15].
