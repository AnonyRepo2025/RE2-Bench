[THOUGHT]
The method `set_city` takes one argument `city` and returns `None` (which is serialized as `null`). The output `null` tells us only that `set_city` was called with some string city. We donâ€™t have any other hints, so we can pick a representative city name, e.g. `"London"`. The instance (`self`) must at least have its `city` attribute (and other attributes initialized by `__init__`), and `args` must contain the new city.
