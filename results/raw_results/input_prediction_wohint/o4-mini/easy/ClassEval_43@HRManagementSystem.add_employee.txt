[THOUGHT]
The method returns False only if the given `employee_id` is already a key in `self.employees`. To produce `output: false`, we must call `add_employee` with an `employee_id` that is already present in `self.employees`. We can represent a prior state where, for example, employee 123 is already added. Then calling `add_employee(123, â€¦)` again yields False.
