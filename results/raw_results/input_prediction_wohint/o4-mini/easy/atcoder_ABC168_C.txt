The output distance is 0.0, which means the two hand-tip coordinates coincide: x_h = x_m and y_h = y_m.

Coordinates:
  θ_h = 2.5π − 2π * ((h + m/60)/12)
  θ_m = 2.5π − 2π * (m/60)
  (x_h, y_h) = (a cos θ_h, a sin θ_h)
  (x_m, y_m) = (b cos θ_m, b sin θ_m)

For them to coincide, we need θ_h ≡ θ_m (mod 2π) and a = b, or both radii zero (a = b = 0).  
θ_h = θ_m  ⇒ (h + m/60)/12 = m/60  ⇒ h/12 = 0  ⇒ h = 0, and m = 0 (so both angles = 2.5π).  
Then with a = b, both points lie at the same spot distance a from center.

The simplest integer choice is a = b = 1, and h = m = 0.

Thus the input line must be:
  "1 1 0 0"
