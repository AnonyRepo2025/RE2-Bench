[THOUGHT]
The function returns 'no' if ch is not in s, so ch must appear in s.  
It strips all leading occurrences of ch from s via s.lstrip(ch), assigns that to sl, and since the final output is "ff" (non‐empty), we must have:
    s.lstrip(ch) == "ff"
That means s is some number (≥1) of ch characters followed by exactly "ff", with no other trailing chars.  
The simplest case is s = "aff" and ch = "a":  
  - 'a' is in "aff", so we don’t return 'no'.  
  - "aff".lstrip('a') -> "ff".  
  - "ff" is non‐empty, so that is returned.  
Hence one valid input is s="aff", ch="a".
