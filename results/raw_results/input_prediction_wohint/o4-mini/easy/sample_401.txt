[THOUGHT]
The function returns `text` unchanged whenever `suffix` is falsey (e.g. `""`) or when `text` does not end with `suffix`. The simplest choice to get `"mathematics"` back is to pass `text="mathematics"` and an empty `suffix` (`""`), so the `if suffix and ...` check fails and it returns `text` directly.
