[THOUGHT]
We need s and l such that f(s, l) returns "urecord".

f does:
1. p = s.ljust(l, '=')
2. return p.rpartition('=')[0], i.e. everything before the last '='.

To get "urecord", the padded string p must end with exactly one '=' (so there is a last '=') and everything before that is "urecord". Thus p = "urecord=".

Since p is of length l, and starts with s followed by '='*(l-len(s)), we have:
- s must be "urecord"
- number of padding '=' = l - len(s) = 1
- len("urecord") = 7, so l = 7 + 1 = 8.

Check: s="urecord", l=8 → s.ljust(8,'=') = "urecord=" → rpartition('=')[0] = "urecord". Matches.

No other padding (e.g. zero padding gives no '=', one is minimal), and more padding would include extra '=' in the head. So the input is s="urecord", l=8.
