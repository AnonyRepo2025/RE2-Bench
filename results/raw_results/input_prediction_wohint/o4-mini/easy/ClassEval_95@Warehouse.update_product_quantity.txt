[THOUGHT]
The method `update_product_quantity` has no return statement, so it always returns `None` (which becomes `null` in JSON). A newly constructed `Warehouse` has an empty `inventory`, so whether or not the `if` block runs, the method still returns `None`. To produce the given output (`null`), we can call `update_product_quantity` on a fresh `Warehouse` instance with any `product_id` and any `quantity`. For concreteness, we'll use `"p001"` and `10`.
