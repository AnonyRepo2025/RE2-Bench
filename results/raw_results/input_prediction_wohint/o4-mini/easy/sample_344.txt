[THOUGHT]
The function f returns its first argument unchanged.  
Given the observed output is [6, 4, 2, 8, 15], the original list argument must have been [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].  
The second argument, operation, is invoked on the sorted copy but its return value or side-effects do not affect the returned list. We can choose a no-op function, e.g. lambda x: None.  
No keyword arguments are used.
