[THOUGHT]
The function iterates over the original length of nums (len = n) and appends each element divisible by 3. The final length is n + k, where k is the count of original elements divisible by 3.  
Given the output [1, 3, 3] has length 3, we look for n and k with n + k = 3 and k ≤ n.  
Possible is n=2, k=1. So the original list had 2 elements, exactly one divisible by 3.  
The output’s first two elements are the originals [1, 3], and the single appended element is 3.  
Thus the input must have been nums = [1, 3].
