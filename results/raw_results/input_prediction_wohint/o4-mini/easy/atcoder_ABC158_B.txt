[THOUGHT]
We need ans = N//(A+B)*A + min(N%(A+B), A) = 0.

A simple way to force this is to take N = 0 (so every term is zero) and choose any positive A, B to avoid division by zero. The minimal choice is A = 1, B = 1. Then
  ans = 0//(1+1)*1 + min(0%(1+1),1) = 0 + min(0,1) = 0.
Therefore a valid input is "0 1 1".
