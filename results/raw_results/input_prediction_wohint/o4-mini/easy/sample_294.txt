[THOUGHT]
The function simply does a global replace of substring n with m in the entire text (splitting into head/mid/tail is irrelevant to the final result). Since the output exactly matches the text string with no apparent replacements, the simplest way to produce this output is to choose an n that does not appear in the text (so replace does nothing) and any arbitrary m. 

For example, take n = "x" (not in the text) and m = "y". Then f("x", "y", text) will return text unchanged, which matches the given output.
