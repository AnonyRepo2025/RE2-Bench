[THOUGHT]
The function returns False only if, during its reverse-step loop, it encounters a 0 at one of the checked indices and then clears the list. The loop checks indices from len(nums)-1 down to 0 in steps of 3, so the simplest case is a single-element list [0]. Then len(nums)=1, so i starts at 0, nums[0]==0, it clears and returns False.
