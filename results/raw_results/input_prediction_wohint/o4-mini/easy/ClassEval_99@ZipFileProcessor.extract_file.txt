[THOUGHT]
The method `extract_file` returns True only if no exception is raised during extraction. This implies:
1. `self.file_name` is a valid path to an existing ZIP archive.
2. The `file_name` argument refers to an entry that exists inside that archive.
3. `output_path` is a valid directory where extraction is permitted.

A simple concrete example satisfying these conditions would be:
- The ZIP archive is named `"archive.zip"`.
- We extract the internal file `"data.txt"`.
- We write it out to the directory `"/tmp"`.

With these inputs, `zipfile.ZipFile("archive.zip", 'r')` opens successfully, and `zip_file.extract("data.txt", "/tmp")` also succeeds, so the method returns True.
