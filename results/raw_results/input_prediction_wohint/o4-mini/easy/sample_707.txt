[THOUGHT]
We need a string `text` and integer `position` such that f(text, position) returns "udbs l".

f does:
1. length = len(text)
2. index = position % (length+1)   (unless position<0, see below)
3. if position < 0 or index < 0, index = -1
4. Remove the character at `index` from `text`.

The result "udbs l" has length 6, so the original `text` must have length 7 (we removed one character). Letâ€™s call the original text T of length 7, and suppose we removed character T[i] to get "udbs l". Then T = out[:i] + T[i] + out[i:].

The simplest choice is to remove the very first character (i = 0). That means T = out but with an extra character prepended. If we prepend e.g. "m" we get T = "mudbs l". Now
- len(T) = 7, so length+1 = 8
- choose position = 0 (>=0), so index = 0 % 8 = 0
- pop index 0 removes the "m", yielding "udbs l" as desired.

Thus one valid input is text = "mudbs l", position = 0.
