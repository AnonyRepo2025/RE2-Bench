[THOUGHT]
The function iterates i over 1, 3, … and does d[arr[i]] = arr[i-1]. The final d has entries "vzjmc": "b" and "ae": "f" in that insertion order. 

– On the first iteration, i = 1, so arr[1] must be "vzjmc" and arr[0] must be "b".  
– On the second iteration, i = 3, so arr[3] must be "ae" and arr[2] must be "f".  

Thus arr = ["b", "vzjmc", "f", "ae"]. Starting with an empty dict d = {} yields exactly the given output.
