[THOUGHT]
The function f does the following:
1. lst.clear() empties the list in place.
2. The for-loop over lst then never iterates (since lst is now empty).
3. The for-else construct thus goes to the else branch and returns True.

Because lst.clear() always makes lst empty before the loop, f(lst) will always return True for any input list. 

We can therefore choose any list as input. For concreteness, weâ€™ll use [3] (even though it contains a 3, it still returns True because the list is cleared first).
