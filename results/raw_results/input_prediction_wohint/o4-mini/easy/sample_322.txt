[THOUGHT]
The simplest way to get the output list back unchanged is to choose num = 0.  
With num = 0, the code does:
1. fish = chemicals[1:] (unused for the return value)  
2. chemicals.reverse()  
3. (no iterations of the loop, since num = 0)  
4. chemicals.reverse()  
Reversing twice returns the list to its original order.  
Therefore, if we set chemicals = ["lsi", "s", "t", "t", "d"] and num = 0, the function returns the same list.
