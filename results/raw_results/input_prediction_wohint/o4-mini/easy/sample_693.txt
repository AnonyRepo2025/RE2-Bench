[THOUGHT]
We need the function to return "x0x0", which is 'x0' repeated n times with n = int(text.find('8')). So text.find('8') must be 2. That means the character '8' appears at index 2 in the string (0-based). A minimal example is "ab8": 'a' at index 0, 'b' at index 1, '8' at index 2. Then n = 2 and the output is "x0" * 2 = "x0x0".
