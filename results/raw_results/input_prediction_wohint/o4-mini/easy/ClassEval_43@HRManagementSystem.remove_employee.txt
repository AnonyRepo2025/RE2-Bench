[THOUGHT]
The `remove_employee` method returns False whenever the given `employee_id` is not found in the `self.employees` dict. Since `employees` is initialized as an empty dict in `__init__`, calling `remove_employee` with any ID will produce `False`. For example, if we pass `42` as the `employee_id`, the method will return `False`.
