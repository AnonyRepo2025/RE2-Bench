[THOUGHT]
The function splits `txt` on `\n`, then applies `line.center(marker)` to each line, and rejoins with `\n`.

Given output:
```
"#[)[]>[^e>\n 8"
```
There are two lines:
1. `#[)[]>[^e>`  
2. ` 8`

Let marker = M.

For the first line, `#[)[]>[^e>` has length 10. Since the output line is exactly that with no extra padding, it must be that M â‰¤ 10, so that `.center(M)` returns the original string unchanged when `M <= len(line)`.

For the second line, the output is `" 8"`, length 2: a single space then `8`. Let the original second line be `"8"`, length 1. To get `" 8"`, we need `M=2`, because width 2 > 1, pad = 1 space, placed on the left (odd pad gives extra left).

Thus:
- txt must be the two-line string: `#[)[]>[^e>\n8`
- marker must be `2`
