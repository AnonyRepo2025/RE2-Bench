[THOUGHT]
The `insert_into_database` method always returns `None` (no return statement), so the observed output `null` simply indicates that the method was called with some `self.database_name`, a `table_name` string, and a `data` list of dicts each containing `'name'` and `'age'`. Any such inputs would produce `null`. As a concrete example, we can assume a database `"example.db"`, table `"users"`, and two records.
