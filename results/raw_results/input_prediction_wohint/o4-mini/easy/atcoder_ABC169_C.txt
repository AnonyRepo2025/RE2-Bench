[THOUGHT]
We need two tokens a and b from input(). b must have length ≥ 3 so that b[2] exists. After transforming b = b[0] + b[2:], we convert both to int and compute a * b // 100, which is 0. This occurs if a * b < 100.

Choose a simple case: a = 1, b = "123"
– b[0] = "1", b[2:] = "3" → b = "13" → int(b) = 13
– a = 1 → int(a) = 1
– 1 * 13 = 13, 13 // 100 = 0

Thus the input string "1 123" produces the desired output 0.
