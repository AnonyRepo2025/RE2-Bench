[THOUGHT]
We know f returned "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2." after stripping. Since the returned string still ends in a period, any chars we stripped must not have included '.', so either we hit the `chars` falsy branch and did `rstrip(' ')`, removing only spaces, or `chars` was a string not containing '.'. The simplest case is that `chars` was falsy (e.g. empty string) so we stripped trailing spaces only. That implies the original `text` ended with spaces after the period. Removing those spaces yields the observed output. Therefore a minimal input is:
text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.   "
chars = ""
