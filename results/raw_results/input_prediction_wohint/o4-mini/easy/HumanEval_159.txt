[THOUGHT]
The function returns `[number + need, remaining - need]` only when `need <= remaining`. Since the output is `[12, 1]`, we have:
1. number + need = 12  
2. remaining - need = 1  

From (2): remaining = need + 1.  
Substitute into (1): number = 12 - need.  

There are infinitely many integer solutions (for any non‐negative need). To pick a simple one, choose need = 1. Then:
- number = 12 − 1 = 11  
- remaining = 1 + 1 = 2  

Feeding these into `eat(11, 1, 2)` indeed yields `[12, 1]`.
