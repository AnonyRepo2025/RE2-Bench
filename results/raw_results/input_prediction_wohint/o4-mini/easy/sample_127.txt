[THOUGHT]
The function splits the input string on line boundaries and returns the number of resulting lines. To get an output of 3, the input must contain exactly two newline separators without a trailing newline (so as not to create an extra empty line). For example, the string "a\nb\nc" splits into ["a", "b", "c"], which has length 3.
