[THOUGHT]
The function returns a sorted list of strings, where each input string n is replaced by n[len(prefix):] if it starts with prefix (and is longer), otherwise left unchanged. Our output is ["dxh","ix","snegi","wiubvu"].

To get "dxh" from a prefixed string, the input must have been "wiubvu" + "dxh" = "wiubvudxh". Similarly:
- "ix"  ← "wiubvuix"
- "snegi" ← "wiubvusnegi"
- "wiubvu" ← "wiubvu" + "wiubvu" = "wiubvuwiubvu"

All four inputs start with the same prefix "wiubvu" and are longer than that prefix, so each is truncated to its suffix. Sorting those suffixes lex gives ["dxh","ix","snegi","wiubvu"], matching the output. Thus:

prefix = "wiubvu"
numbers = ["wiubvudxh","wiubvuix","wiubvusnegi","wiubvuwiubvu"]
