[THOUGHT]
The function f repeatedly does text = text.rstrip(c) for each c in characters. The final result is "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;". Since that string ends in “;”, if any character in characters were “;” then the trailing semicolons would be stripped off in one of the iterations, which does not happen.  

If we choose characters = "r", then the single iteration calls text = text.rstrip("r"). Because the text ends with “;” (not “r”), no characters are removed and the output remains exactly the input.  

Therefore the simplest input that produces the given output is:
text = "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;"
characters = "r"
