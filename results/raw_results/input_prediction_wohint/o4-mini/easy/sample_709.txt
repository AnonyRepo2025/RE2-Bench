[THOUGHT]
The function splits the input string into words, sorts them in reverse (descending) lexicographical order, then joins them with spaces.

The output is "loved a", which means after sorting in reverse order, the list of words is ['loved', 'a'].

Therefore the input must have contained exactly the words "loved" and "a". Their original order doesn't affect the final sorted result, but a simple choice is "a loved":
- split: ["a", "loved"]
- sort(reverse=True): ["loved", "a"]
- join: "loved a"
