We need `check_in` to return `None` (which becomes JSON `null`). Looking at the code:

1. If `room_type` is *not* in `self.booked_rooms`, it returns `False` → not what we want.
2. If `room_type` *is* in `self.booked_rooms`:
   a. If the guest `name` is *not* in `self.booked_rooms[room_type]`, there is no `return` in that branch → falls off end → returns `None`.
   b. If the guest *is* in the dict but requests `room_number` ≤ booked count, the code modifies the dict and again has no `return` → returns `None`.

The simplest is (2a): ensure `room_type` is a key, but the `name` is not in its mapping. For example, set
    booked_rooms = { "double": {} }
Then calling `check_in("double", 101, "Alice")` will:
- skip the first `return False` (key `"double"` exists),
- skip the name-in check body,
- reach end → return `None`.

We also must supply `self.name` and `self.available_rooms`, though they are unused here. We can pick arbitrary values.

Thus:
self: {
  name: "Hotel California",
  available_rooms: 100,
  booked_rooms: { "double": {} }
}
args:
  room_type: "double"
  room_number: 101
  name: "Alice"
No kwargs.
