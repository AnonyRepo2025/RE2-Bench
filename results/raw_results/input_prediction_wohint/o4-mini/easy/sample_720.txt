[THOUGHT]
We need f(items, item) to return 2. The function does:
 1. While the last element of items equals item, pop it (remove trailing matches).
 2. Append item once.
 3. Return the new length.

If the original list length is n and it has k trailing copies of item, after popping k times its length is n–k, then appending makes it n–k+1. We want n–k+1=2 ⇒ n–k=1. The simplest case is n=1, k=0: a one‐element list whose sole element ≠ item. Then the loop skips, we append item, ending up with 2 elements.

For example, items = [0], item = 1:
 - items[-1]==0 !=1, so loop doesn’t run (k=0).
 - Append 1 ⇒ items becomes [0,1].
 - Return len=2.

This satisfies the requirement.
