[THOUGHT]
The method `get_current_date` takes no arguments besides `self`. The only relevant piece of state in `self` is the `datetime` attribute, which was set at initialization to `datetime.datetime.now()`. Since the returned string is `"2025-08-25"`, that means `self.datetime` must be some `datetime.datetime` instance on 2025-08-25 (the time components donâ€™t affect the `%Y-%m-%d` output). 

So the call must have been made on an instance whose `datetime` attribute is a `datetime.datetime` somewhere on 2025-08-25. There are no positional or keyword arguments to `get_current_date`.
