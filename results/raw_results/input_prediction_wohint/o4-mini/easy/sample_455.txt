[THOUGHT]
The function returns `text.upper()` only if there are at least 10 uppercase letters in `text`; otherwise it returns `text` unchanged.
The observed output is `"?XyZ"`, which is not fully uppercased (the `y` remains lowercase), so the branch must have been the else-branch (`uppers < 10`), returning the original `text`.
Therefore the input `text` must itself have been `"?XyZ"`, and its uppercase count (2) is indeed less than 10.
