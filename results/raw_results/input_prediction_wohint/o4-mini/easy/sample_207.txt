[THOUGHT]
The function starts with an empty dict d and then updates it with each dict in the commands iterable in order. To end up with d == {"brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4}, the simplest sequence is three dicts, each supplying one of those keyâ€“value pairs. Applying update in sequence will produce the desired final dict.
