[THOUGHT]
We need f(text, prefix) to return "dbtdabdahesyehu". The function repeatedly strips off `prefix` from the start of `text` while it matches. To get exactly one strip (so the result is our desired string), choose a `prefix` that does not itself appear at the start of the result. 

Let R = "dbtdabdahesyehu". If we set prefix = "a", then R does not start with "a", so only one removal will occur if the original text is "a" + R. 

Thus:
- text = "adbtdabdahesyehu"
- prefix = "a"

First iteration: "adbtdabdahesyehu".startswith("a") → strip → "dbtdabdahesyehu".  
Next iteration: "dbtdabdahesyehu".startswith("a") → False → return "dbtdabdahesyehu".  
Matches the given output.
