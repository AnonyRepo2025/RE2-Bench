[THOUGHT]
We want contravariant_order(expr) to return 2.

Looking at the code:
- BaseVectorField instances have order 1.
- TensorProduct sums the orders of its arguments.
- Other constructs (Add, Mul, Pow, else) either return 0, raise an error, or âˆ’1.

Thus the simplest way to get 2 is to pass a TensorProduct of two BaseVectorField objects:
  expr = TensorProduct(v1, v2)
where v1 and v2 are BaseVectorField instances, each contributing order 1, so total 2.

We can leave `_strict` at its default value, False.

Therefore the input should supply `expr` as a TensorProduct of two BaseVectorField instances, and `_strict` false.
