[THOUGHT]
The `partial_fit` method signature is `partial_fit(self, X, y=None)`. After calling it, the scaler’s attributes become:

- with_mean=True, with_std=True, copy=True (these come from `__init__`)
- n_samples_seen_ = 470  → the number of rows in X is 470
- mean_.shape = (30,)    → X has 30 columns
- var_.shape = (30,)
- scale_.shape = (30,)

Thus the input X must have been a 2D array of shape (470, 30), and y was not provided (i.e. stayed at its default `None`).
