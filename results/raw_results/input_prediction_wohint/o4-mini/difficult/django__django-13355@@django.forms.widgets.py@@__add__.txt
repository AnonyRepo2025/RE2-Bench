[THOUGHT]
The only way for the `+` operator (`__add__`) to hand back a `Media` whose `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` both serialize to JSON `null` is if it simply copied `None` through from its operands.  Since

```python
combined._css_lists = self._css_lists[:]
combined._js_lists  = self._js_lists[:]
```

we would need `self._css_lists` and `self._js_lists` themselves to be `None` so that the “slice” copy ends up as `None` (in this contrived example).  By the same token, nothing meaningful happens with `other` because the loops over `other._css_lists` and `other._js_lists` never add anything if they’re `None` (and we assume no exception is raised for the sake of this hypothetical).

Hence both operands passed into `__add__` must have their internal lists set to `None`.
