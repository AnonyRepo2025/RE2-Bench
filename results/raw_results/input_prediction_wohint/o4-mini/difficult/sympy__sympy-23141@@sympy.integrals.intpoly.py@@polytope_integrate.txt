[THOUGHT]
The function returned a single SymPy Rational, so it must have been called with a concrete polytope (a 2-D Polygon or V-representation) and a single expression (not a list), with the default flags (clockwise=False, max_degree=None). In that case the last line

    return main_integrate(expr, facets, hp_params)

produces the Rational that was serialized as `"1633405224899363/24000000000000"`. 

We cannot reconstruct the exact polygon and integrand from the number alone, but we know the JSON input must have had these keys:
- “poly”: a description of the polygon (e.g. a list of vertex coordinates)
- “expr”: a string form of the SymPy expression
- “clockwise”: false
- “max_degree”: null

Below is the minimal JSON structure that would match the call which produced that Rational result. (The actual numeric value of the vertices and expression are not recoverable from the output alone; this is the only unambiguous part of the input.)
