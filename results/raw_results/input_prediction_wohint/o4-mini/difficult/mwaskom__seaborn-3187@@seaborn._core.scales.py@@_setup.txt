[THOUGHT]
We see that after calling `_setup`, the returned scale object has

- `_tick_params` and `_label_params` populated (they were `None` on entry, so the code’s first two checks each called `.tick()` and `.label()`),
- `_matplotlib_scale` replaced with a new MPL scale (so the incoming attribute was irrelevant),
- `_legend` stayed `None` (so `prop.legend` must have been False),
- no normalization was applied (`values` and `norm` remain `None`, so `prop.normed` was False),
- `trans` remains `"log"`,
- `_priority` was untouched (so started at `0`),
- `_pipeline` and `_spacer` are set by the method (we need not specify their exact function elements; they were built from `axis` and `prop.get_mapping`).

The only things we must choose to produce exactly this state are:

- An incoming `self` with
  - `values = None`
  - `norm = None`
  - `trans = "log"`
  - `_tick_params = None`
  - `_label_params = None`
  - `_legend = None`
  - `_priority = 0`
  - (we can set `_matplotlib_scale`, `_pipeline`, `_spacer` to `None` or omit, since they get overwritten)
- `data` must be a pandas Series whose `name` is the empty string (so that `_shorthand_name` ends up `""`).
- `prop` must be a Property‐like with
  - `normed = False`
  - `legend = False`
  - a trivial `get_mapping` (the actual mapping function ends up in the pipeline; we don’t need its body here)
- `axis` left as `None` (so the code creates a new `PseudoAxis`).

Putting that into the same JSON‐call signature schema as the example:
