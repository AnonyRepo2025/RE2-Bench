[THOUGHT]
The returned header is built from these internal values:
- username → self.username = "user"
- password → self.password = "pass"
- realm → self._thread_local.chal['realm'] = "me@kennethreitz.com"
- nonce → self._thread_local.chal['nonce'] = "54c8df80c7443b10ad9890ddfce551f9"
- qop → self._thread_local.chal['qop'] = "auth"
- algorithm → self._thread_local.chal['algorithm'] = "MD5"
- opaque → self._thread_local.chal['opaque'] = "cbe3b2ba4f82f0040cf76baec4025b43"
- nc is formatted from thread_local.nonce_count = 1 (since last_nonce was different or unset)
- cnonce is derived deterministically to "e2f9f401162cf240"
- The URI in the header is the path of the URL: "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass"
We choose a placeholder domain (e.g. example.com) for the URL.  
last_nonce must not equal the new nonce so that nonce_count is reset to 1; we set last_nonce = null.  
Method is not shown in the header but is required; default to "GET".
