[THOUGHT]
The only way to get back exactly “tanh(x)**(-3)” unchanged from bottom_up is to start with that same expression, since `_osbornei` only transforms instances of `TrigonometricFunction` (sin, cos, tan, etc.). Hyperbolic functions (`tanh`, `sinh`, …) are not instances of `TrigonometricFunction`, so `f` will return them (and any powers of them) unchanged. The second argument `d` is only used when extracting linear dependence from a trig argument, which never happens here, so it can be any symbol. By convention we choose `x`.
