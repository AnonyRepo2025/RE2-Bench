The report shows three classes “blue”, “green”, “red” with supports 24, 31, 20 (sum 75). The true labels must therefore consist of 24 “blue”, 31 “green”, 20 “red” entries.  
Precision/recall figures imply the following confusion counts:

- blue: TP=19, FN=5; of those 5 false blues, 4 were predicted green and 1 red  
- green: TP=3, FN=28; of those 28 false greens, 24 were predicted red and 4 blue  
- red: TP=18, FN=2; both false reds were predicted green  

This yields FP counts matching the precision values:
- FP_blue = 4 (from green→blue)  
- FP_green = 4 (blue→green) + 2 (red→green) = 6  
- FP_red = 1 (blue→red) + 24 (green→red) = 25  

So one valid input is
y_true = 24×"blue" + 31×"green" + 20×"red"  
y_pred = 
  first 24 (true blue): 19×"blue", 4×"green", 1×"red"  
+ next 31 (true green): 3×"green", 24×"red", 4×"blue"  
+ last 20 (true red): 18×"red", 2×"green"  

All other parameters were left at default (labels=None, target_names=None, etc.).
