[THOUGHT]
We need an input `expr` to `simplify` that will produce the numeric result 50. One of the simplest choices is the string `"100/2"`. 

1. `sympify("100/2")` returns the rational number `Rational(100,2)`, which is automatically reduced to `50`.  
2. In `simplify`, since `50` is a number (a `Basic` with no args), it immediately returns it unchanged.  
3. Finally, the JSON-serialized output is `"50"`.

No other parameters (`ratio`, `measure`, `rational`) need to be passed, as their defaults do not affect this numeric case.
