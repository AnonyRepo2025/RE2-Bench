[THOUGHT]
We need the program’s output `ans` to be 1.  
The code counts:
- Each suffix whose value mod 2019 is 0 contributes +1.
- Each pair of suffixes with the same mod also contributes +1 (via n*(n−1)/2).

To get a total of 1, the simplest case is a single‐digit input “0”:
- The only suffix is “0”, whose numeric value mod 2019 is 0 → contributes 1.
- No pairs of suffixes exist → contributes 0.
Total = 1.
