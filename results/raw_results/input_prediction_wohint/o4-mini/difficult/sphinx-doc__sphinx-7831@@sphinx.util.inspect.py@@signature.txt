[THOUGHT]
The only way `inspect.Signature.__str__` would produce "(arg, kwarg=None)" is if the `subject` callable has exactly two parameters: a positional parameter named "arg" and a keyword parameter named "kwarg" with default `None`. The `bound_method` and `follow_wrapped` flags were not mentioned, so they must have remained at their default value of `False`.  
Therefore, the input to `signature` was:
- subject: a function defined as `def foo(arg, kwarg=None): ...`
- bound_method: False
- follow_wrapped: False
