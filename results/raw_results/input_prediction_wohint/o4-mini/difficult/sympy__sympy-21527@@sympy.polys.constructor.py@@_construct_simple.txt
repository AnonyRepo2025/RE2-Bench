[THOUGHT]
We observe that the function always returns a 2‐tuple `(domain, result)`.  Our captured JSON output is

  "output": [
    {},
    null
  ]

i.e. two entries: the first (“{}”) is the serialized `domain` object, and the second (`null`) is the serialized `result`.  The only way for the function to return a non‐`None` domain but a `None` result is to never enter the loop over coefficients (so that `coeffs` is empty), pick the default integer domain, and then produce an empty result list—which in this particular JSON dump shows up as `null`.

Concretely:

- With `coeffs = []`, the flags `rationals, floats, complexes, algebraics` all remain `False`.
- `float_numbers` is empty so `max_prec = 53`.
- Neither `floats` nor `complexes` nor `(rationals or opt.field)` is true, so we fall through to  
    `domain = ZZ_I if complexes else ZZ` ⇒ `domain = ZZ`.
- We then do `result = [domain.from_sympy(coeff) for coeff in coeffs]` ⇒ an empty list.
- In this dump, that empty‐list result appears as `null`.

Therefore the call must have been:

    _construct_simple([], opt)

with `opt.extension = False` and `opt.field = False` (the default).
