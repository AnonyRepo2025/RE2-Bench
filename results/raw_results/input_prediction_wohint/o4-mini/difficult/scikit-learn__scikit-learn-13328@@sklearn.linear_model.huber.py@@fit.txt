The fitted model reports a coefficient vector of length 20, so X must have 20 features. The outliers_ mask has 50 entries, so X has 50 samples and y has length 50. Since no sample_weight was passed, sample_weight was None and defaulted internally to ones. The hyper‐parameters (epsilon, max_iter, alpha, warm_start, fit_intercept, tol) match the defaults and are set on self before calling fit. Therefore the call was approximately:

model = HuberRegressor(epsilon=1.35, max_iter=100, alpha=0.0001,
                       warm_start=False, fit_intercept=True, tol=1e-05)
model.fit(X, y)

with X a (50×20) array and y a length‐50 array.
