[THOUGHT]
1. The `call_command` function signature is `call_command(command_name, *args, **options)`.  
2. The observed output is exactly three lines:  
   BEGIN;  
   Hello!  
   COMMIT;  
3. This suggests there is a management command (either looked up by name or passed in directly) whose `execute` method prints those three lines.  
4. No positional arguments (`args`) or keyword options (`options`) are needed to produce exactly those three lines.  
5. Therefore the simplest call must have been with just the command’s name (or instance) and no additional args or options.  
6. We’ll assume the command was invoked by its name, e.g. `"hello"`.  
7. Thus the input to `call_command` was: command_name = "hello", args = [], options = {}.
