[THOUGHT]
1. The returned tuple has four elements: (code, dictionary, errors, n_iter). Since there are four entries in the JSON `"output"` array (the first two are the 2D arrays as strings, the third is `null`, and the fourth is `24`), we must have called  
   `dict_learning(..., return_n_iter=True)`  
   so that we get back `(code, dictionary, errors, n_iter)`.

2. The shapes of the first two arrays tell us the dimensions:
   - `code` is printed as a (10×5) matrix ⇒ X must have 10 samples, and `n_components=5`.
   - `dictionary` is printed as a (5×8) matrix ⇒ X must have 8 features.
   So the input `X` must be a 10×8 array.

3. Everything else appears to be left at its defaults:
   - `alpha` was provided (it is a required positional), but since we don’t see any anomalies in the outputs, we can assume `alpha=1.0` (the most common default in examples).
   - `max_iter`, `tol`, `method`, `n_jobs`, `dict_init`, `code_init`, `callback`, `verbose`, `random_state`, `positive_dict`, `positive_code`, and `method_max_iter` are all left at their defaults.
   - `return_n_iter=True` to produce the fourth output `24`.

4. We cannot reconstruct the exact entries of X from the code and dictionary (because the dictionary learning is approximate), so we simply denote `X` as the 10×8 array that was passed in.

5. Therefore the call must have looked like:
     dict_learning(X, 5, 1.0, max_iter=100, tol=1e-8,
                   method='lars', n_jobs=None,
                   dict_init=None, code_init=None,
                   callback=None, verbose=False,
                   random_state=None, return_n_iter=True,
                   positive_dict=False, positive_code=False,
                   method_max_iter=1000)
