The output is  
  2**Sum(2*f(k), (k, 1, n))  

This arises in the Pow-handling clause:

    elif term.is_Pow:
        if not term.base.has(k):
            s = summation(term.exp, (k, a, n))
            return term.base ** s

So  
– term must be a Pow whose base does not contain k,  
– term.base == 2,  
– term.exp must be 2*f(k) so that summation(term.exp, (k,1,n)) is Sum(2*f(k),(k,1,n)).  
– limits must be (k, 1, n).

Therefore the call was  
    _eval_product(self, term=2**(2*f(k)), limits=(k,1,n))
