[THOUGHT]
We know that `_make_test_folds` only ever looks at `self.n_splits`, `self.shuffle` (and `self.random_state` if shuffling), plus the array `y`.  The output array contains only the integers 0–4, so `n_splits` must be 5.  There are no signs of random shuffling (we see long contiguous runs of the same fold index), so `shuffle=False` (and hence `random_state=None` is irrelevant).  The first argument `X` is never touched by `_make_test_folds`, so it can be any array of the same length as `y`; typically one just passes the feature‐matrix, but for fold‐assignment purposes it is ignored.  

Thus the call was effectively:

    self = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=False, random_state=None)
    _make_test_folds(self, X, y)

where `len(y)` equals the length of the output array (here 150), and `y` is the target‐vector that produced exactly the shown fold‐index array.
