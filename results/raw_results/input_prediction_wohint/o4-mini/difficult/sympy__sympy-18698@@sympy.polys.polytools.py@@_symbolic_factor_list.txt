[THOUGHT]
We need the function to return (coeff, factors) = (S.One, []). The JSON shows `"1"` and `null` (representing an empty or None list of factors). In `_symbolic_factor_list`, when the expression is a pure number, it triggers the `arg.is_Number` branch:

1. coeff starts as `S.One`.
2. Seeing `arg.is_Number`, it multiplies `coeff` by that number and continues; `factors` stays as the empty list `[]`.
3. Since `method != 'sqf'`, we skip the special `sqf` reassembly.
4. Finally, we return `(coeff, factors)`, i.e. `(1, [])`.

To get that, pick:
- expr = 1
- opt = None (unused for numeric input)
- method = any string â‰  'sqf', e.g. "factor"

This yields the desired output.
