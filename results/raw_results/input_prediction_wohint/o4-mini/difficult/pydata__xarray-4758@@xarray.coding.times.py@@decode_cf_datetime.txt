[THOUGHT]
The output is a 1-D array of five timestamps:
  '1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000'
  '1681-05-27T13:00:00.500000000'
  '1681-05-27T14:00:00.500000000'
  '1681-05-27T15:00:00.500000000'
  '1681-05-27T16:00:00.500000000'

The code path uses `_decode_datetime_with_pandas` because `calendar=None` and no pandas exception is raised. That does:

1. Parse `units` by splitting on " since ", yielding `delta_units` and `ref_date`.
2. Convert `ref_date` to a `pd.Timestamp`. The fractional 0.5 in the output (microsecond = 500 000) must come from the reference date, not from the increments.
3. Multiply each element of `flat_num_dates` by the nanoseconds-per-`delta_units` constant and add to `ref_date`.

Since the output times are exactly at hours 12â€¦16 on 1681-05-27, plus 0.5 s, it means:
- `delta_units` is "hours"
- `ref_date` is "1681-05-27 00:00:00.5"
- `flat_num_dates` is `[12, 13, 14, 15, 16]`

Thus the original call must have been:
   decode_cf_datetime([12, 13, 14, 15, 16],
                      "hours since 1681-05-27 00:00:00.5")

`calendar` and `use_cftime` were left as defaults (`None`).
