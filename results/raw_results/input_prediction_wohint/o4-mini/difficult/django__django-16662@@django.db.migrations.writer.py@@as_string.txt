[THOUGHT]
The output is just the minimal migration file:

from django.db import migrations


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
    ]

    operations = [
    ]

No header (“# Generated by Django …”) appears, so `include_header` must be False. Both `migration.dependencies` and `migration.operations` must be empty lists, and there are no replaces or initial flags set. Thus the `MigrationWriter` instance has:
- migration.operations = []
- migration.dependencies = []
- migration.replaces = []
- migration.initial = False
- include_header = False

as input to `as_string`.
