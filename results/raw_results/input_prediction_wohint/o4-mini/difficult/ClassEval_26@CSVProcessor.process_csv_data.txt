[THOUGHT]
The method `process_csv_data` returns 1 whenever it successfully reads a CSV file named by `save_file_name`, processes column `N`, and writes out the new file. Since the only thing we know is that it returned 1 (i.e. no exception occurred), we can infer that the arguments must have been:
- `N`: some integer index referring to a valid column in the CSV
- `save_file_name`: a string ending in “.csv” pointing to an existing, readable CSV file

Beyond that, there’s nothing in the output that pins down the exact values of `N` or `save_file_name`. Any valid combination would yield the same return value 1.

Hence, we cannot determine the precise input, only its shape.
