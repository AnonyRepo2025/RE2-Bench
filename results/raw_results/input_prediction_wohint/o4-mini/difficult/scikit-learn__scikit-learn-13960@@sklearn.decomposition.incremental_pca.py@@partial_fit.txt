[THOUGHT]
1. After a single call to `partial_fit`, the reported  
   - `n_samples_seen_ == 100` ⇒ the input array `X` must have 100 rows.  
   - `components_.shape[1] == 3` ⇒ `X` must have 3 columns.  
   - Since `n_components` was left as `None` and no prior components existed,  
     `n_components_ = min(n_samples, n_features) = min(100, 3) = 3`.  
2. The printed  
   - `mean_`  = [0.090962, –0.12025564, –0.02202145]  
   - `var_`   = [0.98004322,  0.87276777,  1.009518  ]  
   - `singular_values_` = [10.92506979, 9.35311337, 8.91038833]  
   - `components_`  = the 3×3 right‐singular‐vector matrix  
   are exactly the column‐means, column‐variances, singular values, and right singular vectors of `X`.  
3. Thus the call must have been  
     `pca.partial_fit(X)`  
   on a NumPy array `X` of shape `(100, 3)` whose columns have the above statistics and whose SVD yields the given singular values and vectors.  
4. No `y` was supplied, and `check_input` was left at its default `True`.  

We therefore reconstruct the function‐call input as JSON:
