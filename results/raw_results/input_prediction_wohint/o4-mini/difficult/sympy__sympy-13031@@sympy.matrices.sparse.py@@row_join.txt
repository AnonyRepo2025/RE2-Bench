[THOUGHT]
We need to find two sparse‐matrix inputs, self and other, such that calling self.row_join(other) produces a 2×1 matrix with entries (0,0)=1 and (1,0)=2.

The code does:
1. If self.cols==0 and self.rows!=other.rows, it does a special fallback; we avoid that by having self.cols==0 but self.rows==other.rows.
2. Then it checks self.rows==other.rows (must be 2==2).
3. It copies self (so starts from an empty smat if self had none) and then for each (i,j),v in other._smat it writes into A._smat[(i, j+self.cols)]. Since self.cols=0, new column indices are just j.
4. Finally A.cols += other.cols → 0+1 = 1.

Thus we take self to be a 2×0 matrix with no stored entries, and other to be a 2×1 matrix whose _smat is exactly { (0,0):1, (1,0):2 }.

Representing keys and values as strings (as in the given output), we get:
