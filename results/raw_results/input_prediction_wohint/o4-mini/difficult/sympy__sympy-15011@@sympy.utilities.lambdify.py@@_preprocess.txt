[THOUGHT]
The `_preprocess` method returns a tuple `(argstrs, expr)`, which is JSON-serialized here as `["argstrs", expr]`. The given output is `[null, "x**2"]`. In JSON, `null` corresponds to Python’s `None`, but since `argstrs` is initialized to an empty list `[]` and never reassigned, the only way it could serialize to `null` here is if it were empty and the serializer collapsed empty lists to `null` (or it was simply rendered as `null` to indicate “no positional arguments”). In any case, it means that there were no arguments passed in, so the input `args` must have been the empty list `[]`.

The second element of the output is the (stringified) expression `"x**2"`, which is exactly the `expr` argument returned unchanged—so the input `expr` must have been the Sympy expression corresponding to `x**2` (here represented as the string `"x**2"` in JSON).

Hence, the call was effectively
    _preprocess(self, args = [], expr = x**2)
with no dummy substitution taking place.
