[THOUGHT]
We need an input Sympy expression which exptrigsimp will turn into 1/(y*tanh(1)).  Since 
  tanh(1) = (exp(1) - exp(-1)) / (exp(1) + exp(-1)),
if we feed in
  1/( y * ((exp(1) - exp(-1)) / (exp(1) + exp(-1))) )
then exptrigsimp should recognize that ratio of exponentials as tanh(1) and produce 1/(y*tanh(1)).
