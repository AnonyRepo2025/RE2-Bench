[THOUGHT]
The output expr is exactly “x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n” and both the mapping and nc_syms slots are null, which matches the branch where eq.is_commutative is True. In that case `_mask_nc` returns (eq, {}, []), which JSON‐serializes to `[ "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n", null, null ]`. No substitutions were made, and the default name (`None`) was used. Therefore the input `eq` must have been the same commutative expression, and `name` was not provided (i.e. `null`).
