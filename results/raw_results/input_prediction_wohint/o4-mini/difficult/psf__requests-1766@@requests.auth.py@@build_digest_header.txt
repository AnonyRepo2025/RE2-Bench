[THOUGHT]
We need to reconstruct the state of the HTTPDigestAuth instance and the arguments `method` and `url` that would produce exactly

Digest username="user", realm="me@kennethreitz.com", nonce="b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4", uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", response="a15a1e022b6edf3943bcf7e43ca0ad07", opaque="21d73260ff0b61c1f304ee40444f24bf", algorithm="MD5", qop="auth", nc=00000002, cnonce="f06a18e88940ac77"

from `build_digest_header`.

1. The `username` and `password` must be `"user"` and `"pass"` so that A1 = "user:me@kennethreitz.com:pass" yields the correct HA1.
2. The `chal` dict must contain:
   - realm = "me@kennethreitz.com"
   - nonce = "b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4"
   - qop = "auth"
   - algorithm = "MD5"  (so that the `algorithm="MD5"` field appears in the header)
   - opaque = "21d73260ff0b61c1f304ee40444f24bf"
3. The incoming `self.last_nonce` must equal the current nonce, and `self.nonce_count` must be 1, so that the code increments it to 2 and formats `nc=00000002`.
4. The method must be `"GET"`, and the URL must parse to a path of `/digest-auth/auth/user/pass`â€”for example `"https://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/user/pass"`.
5. The fixed `cnonce` and final `response` indicate a deterministic run (seeded time/urandom) but we only need to reflect the values.

Thus the input state is:
