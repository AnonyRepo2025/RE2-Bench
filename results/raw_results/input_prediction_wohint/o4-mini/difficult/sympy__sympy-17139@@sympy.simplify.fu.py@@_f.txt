[THOUGHT]
The only way `_f` can return `-I*sin(x)` is if the incoming `rv` does not match the `is_Pow`‐and‐`base.func==f` pattern (or the exponent checks fail), in which case `_f` simply returns `rv` unchanged. Therefore the input to `_f` must have been exactly the same Sympy expression `-I*sin(x)`.
