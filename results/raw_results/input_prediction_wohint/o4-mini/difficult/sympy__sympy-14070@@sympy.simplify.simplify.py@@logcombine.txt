[THOUGHT]
We look at the code for logcombine:

- It defines an inner function f(rv) that immediately returns rv unchanged if it is not an Add or Mul.
- The outer function applies bottom_up(expr, f), which for a leaf expr that isnâ€™t an Add or Mul will simply return expr.
- The output given is `"2"`, i.e. the integer 2.
- The simplest way to get back 2 is to call logcombine on the integer 2 (with the default force=False).
