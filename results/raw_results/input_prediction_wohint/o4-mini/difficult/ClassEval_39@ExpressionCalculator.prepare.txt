[THOUGHT]
The `prepare` method does not return anything (no `return` statement), so in Python it always returns `None`, which shows up as `null` in the JSON output. Hence, regardless of what expression string was passed in, the `"output"` field will be `null`. To match the given output, the input must simply be a call to `prepare` with some expression string. For concreteness we can represent the `ExpressionCalculator` instance as an empty object (its internal state isnâ€™t part of the call signature) and pick a plausible expression, e.g. `"1+2"`.
