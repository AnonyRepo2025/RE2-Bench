[THOUGHT]
The `process_view` method returns an HttpResponseForbidden (with content-type "text/html") as shown by the `_headers` in the output. That only happens when:

1. `request.method` is not one of ('GET','HEAD','OPTIONS','TRACE') — e.g. "POST".
2. `request._dont_enforce_csrf_checks` is False or not set.
3. Either the referer check is skipped (because `request.is_secure()` is False) or passed, and then
4. `request.META.get('CSRF_COOKIE')` is None, triggering `REASON_NO_CSRF_COOKIE`.

Also the early checks for `request.csrf_processing_done` and `callback.csrf_exempt` must be False or unset, so they don’t short-circuit to None.

Thus a minimal input that leads to this rejection is:
- request.method = "POST"
- no `request._dont_enforce_csrf_checks`
- request.scheme = "http" (so `is_secure()` is False)
- empty `request.META` (no CSRF_COOKIE)
- callback with no `csrf_exempt` attribute
- empty callback_args and callback_kwargs

We can omit any internal state on `self` since `CsrfViewMiddleware` holds no per-instance state used here.
