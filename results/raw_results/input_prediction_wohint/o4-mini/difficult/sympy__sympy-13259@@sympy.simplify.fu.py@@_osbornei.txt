[THOUGHT]
The function `_osbornei(e, d)` walks `e` bottom‐up and only rewrites instances of `TrigonometricFunction` (sin, cos, tan, …). Since the output is `2*tanh(x)`, which involves the hyperbolic `tanh` and no trig functions, the transformer never kicks in and simply returns its input unchanged. Therefore the input expression `e` must have been `2*tanh(x)`. The dummy symbol `d` is only used to peel off factors of `d` in trig‐arguments; since there are no trig functions (and no occurrences of `d`) it doesn’t matter what `d` is, so we can pick a fresh symbol, say `"d"`.
