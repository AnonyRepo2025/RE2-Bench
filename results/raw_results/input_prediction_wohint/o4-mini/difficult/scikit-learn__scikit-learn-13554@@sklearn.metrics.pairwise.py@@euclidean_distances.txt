[THOUGHT]
We need a pair of 1×D arrays X and Y so that the single‐entry Euclidean distance between their only rows is 1.1649954. The simplest choice is D=1. Let
  X = [[0.0]]
  Y = [[1.1649954]]
Then
  distance = sqrt((0.0 − 1.1649954)²) = 1.1649954
which matches the given output. All other parameters use their defaults (Y_norm_squared=None, squared=False, X_norm_squared=None).
