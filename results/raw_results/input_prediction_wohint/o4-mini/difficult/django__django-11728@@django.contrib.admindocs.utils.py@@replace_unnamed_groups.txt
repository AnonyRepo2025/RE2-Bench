[THOUGHT]
1. The function only changes the pattern if it finds unnamed “( ... )” groups.  
2. The returned output is exactly “^a/?$” with no “<var>” inserted, so no unnamed groups were detected.  
3. Therefore the input pattern must have contained no parentheses, and so was returned unchanged.  
4. The simplest such input is the pattern itself: “^a/?$”.
