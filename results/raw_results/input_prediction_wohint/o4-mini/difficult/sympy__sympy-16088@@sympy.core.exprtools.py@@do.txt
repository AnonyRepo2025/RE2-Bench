[THOUGHT]
The `factor_terms` function calls `sympify(expr)` and then immediately invokes `do(expr)`. In this case `do` returns the expression unchanged, since it’s a `Mul` of an `Add` and a `Pow` whose sub‐expressions don’t change under the content–primitive routines. The final printed output

  (-1 + sqrt(3)*I)*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)

must therefore be exactly the SymPy expression passed into `do`.
