[THOUGHT]
The `fit` method signature is `fit(self, X, y, sample_weight=None)`. In the provided “output” we see that after fitting, the label encoder `le_` and `classes_` are both `array([0, 1, 2])`. That implies that the training labels `y` must have contained exactly the classes 0, 1 and 2 (at least one example of each).  
No information is given about feature values, so we can choose any dummy feature array `X` with three rows (one per label).  
The default for `sample_weight` was never overridden, so it remains `None`.  
A minimal consistent call would therefore be, for example:  
X = [[1], [1], [1]]  
y = [0, 1, 2]  
sample_weight = None
