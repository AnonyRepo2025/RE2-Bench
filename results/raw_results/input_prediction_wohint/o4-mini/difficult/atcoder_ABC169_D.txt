[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer x and computes its prime factorization, then for each exponent e computes 
  f(e) = the largest j such that 1+2+…+j ≤ e (with f(1)=1).
Finally ans = sum of these f(e) over all prime factors.

We need ans = 2.

Possibilities:
- A single prime power p^e with f(e)=2. That occurs when e=3,4,5 (since 1+2=3 ≤ e < 6). For example x=2^3=8.
- Two distinct primes (each exponent e=1), since f(1)=1, so 1+1=2. For example x=2·3=6.

The simplest choice is x=6. Indeed:
  factorization(6) = [[2,1],[3,1]]
  f(1)=1 for each, so ans = 1+1 = 2.

Thus the input must be "6".
