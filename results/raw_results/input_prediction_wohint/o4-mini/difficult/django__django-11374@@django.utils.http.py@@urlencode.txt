[THOUGHT]
The output “a=1&b=2&c=3” is exactly what urllib.parse.urlencode would produce given a sequence of key–value pairs [("a","1"),("b","2"),("c","3")] (or [("a",1),…]) with doseq=False.

In our wrapper:
- We never hit the MultiValueDict path.
- If query has an .items(), we do query = query.items(), so passing in a dict produces an iterable of (key, value) pairs.
- With doseq=False, every value—whether str, bytes, int, or list—is taken as is (no per-item expansion).
- original_urlencode then stringifies each value and joins them as “a=1&b=2&c=3”.

Therefore a minimal input is:
  query = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
  doseq = False
