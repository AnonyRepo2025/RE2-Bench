[THOUGHT]
The list li is built by concatenating the digits of all numbers from 1 up to 370, then the last two digits are popped off. However, the early part of li is simply the digits 1,2,3,…,9 at indices 1–9. The code then reads an integer n and prints li[n–1]. To get an output of 7, the simplest choice is n=7, since li[7–1] = li[6] = 7.
