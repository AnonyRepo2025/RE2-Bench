[THOUGHT]
1. The result is a single tuple of two expressions, so `diop_solve` must have taken a linear Diophantine equation in two variables, returning the general solution for \[x,y\].
2. The expressions are  
   x =  3*t₀ – 5  
   y =  2*t₀ – 5  
   which implies  
   t₀ = (y + 5)/2  
   and substituting into x gives 2x – 3y = 5.
3. Hence the equation solved was 2*x – 3*y – 5 = 0 (or equivalently 2*x – 3*y = 5).
4. No `param` argument was passed, so the default parameter generator (yielding t₀) was used.
