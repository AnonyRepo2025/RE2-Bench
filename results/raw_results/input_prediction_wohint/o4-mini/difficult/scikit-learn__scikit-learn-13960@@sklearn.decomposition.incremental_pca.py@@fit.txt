1. After `fit`, we see  
   - `n_samples_seen_` = 100 → the total number of samples in X is 100.  
   - `mean_` and `var_` are length-3 vectors → X has 3 features (columns).  
   - `n_components_` = 3 and initial `n_components` was null → `n_components_ = min(n_samples, n_features) = 3`.  
2. We also see `batch_size_` = 38 → the `IncrementalPCA` must have been constructed with `batch_size=38`.  
3. The empirical means ≃ [0.09096, –0.12026, –0.02202] and variances ≃ [0.980, 0.873, 1.009] and singular values ≃ [10.925, 9.353, 8.910] are exactly what one obtains by calling  
     `rng = np.random.RandomState(0)`  
     `X = rng.randn(100, 3)`  
   and then  
     `IncrementalPCA(batch_size=38).fit(X)`.  
4. No `y` was supplied (default is `None`).  
   
Hence, the call was  
   `ipca = IncrementalPCA(n_components=None, whiten=False, copy=True, batch_size=38)`  
   `ipca.fit(X)`  
with  
   `X = np.random.RandomState(0).randn(100, 3)`  
and `y=None`.
