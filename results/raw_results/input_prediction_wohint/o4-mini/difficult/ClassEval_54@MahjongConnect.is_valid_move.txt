[THOUGHT]
The method is_valid_move first checks:
1. Both positions in bounds.
2. pos1 != pos2.
3. board icons at pos1 and pos2 are equal.
4. there is a path of same‐icon tiles between them.

We know the board has been set to:
[
  ['a','b','c','a'],
  ['a','b','c','a'],
  ['a','b','c','a'],
  ['a','b','c','a']
]
and the result is False. The simplest way to get False is step 3: pick two in‐bounds, distinct positions whose icons differ. For example, pos1=(0,0) has 'a' and pos2=(0,1) has 'b', so is_valid_move returns False immediately.

The object state (`self`) has BOARD_SIZE [4,4], ICONS ['a','b','c'], and the above board, and no keyword arguments were passed.
