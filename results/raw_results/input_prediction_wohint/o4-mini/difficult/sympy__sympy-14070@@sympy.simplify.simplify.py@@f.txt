[THOUGHT]
The logged JSON shows a single parameter named “nargs” whose internal `_elements` is `frozenset({1, 2})`. In SymPy’s FiniteSet (or similar var-args constructor), the constructor takes its arguments as `*nargs` and then stores them in a frozenset called `_elements`. Seeing `_elements = frozenset({1, 2})` means that the original positional arguments were `1` and `2`. Therefore the call must have been something like `FiniteSet(1, 2)`, i.e. `nargs = (1, 2)`.
