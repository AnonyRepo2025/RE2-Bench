[THOUGHT]
The JSON object  
```json
{
  "_rows": 2,
  "_cols": 2,
  "_mat": null
}
```  
is exactly the internal state of a SymPy dense‐matrix object (ImmutableDenseMatrix or DenseMatrix) with 2 rows, 2 columns, and no concrete element list (`_mat = None`).  In Python that corresponds to one of the SymPy matrix classes, e.g.  
```python
from sympy.matrices.immutable import ImmutableDenseMatrix
expr = ImmutableDenseMatrix.__new__(ImmutableDenseMatrix, 2, 2, None)
```  
(The constructor is private, but essentially builds an empty 2×2 matrix container.)  

The function `_matrix_derivative` takes two parameters, `expr` and `x`, so the JSON input must have passed this matrix as `expr`.  Since there is no information about `x` in the given JSON, it must have been `None` (JSON `null`).  

Hence the call was:  
```python
_matrix_derivative(expr, None)
```  
where `expr` is that 2×2 matrix object.
