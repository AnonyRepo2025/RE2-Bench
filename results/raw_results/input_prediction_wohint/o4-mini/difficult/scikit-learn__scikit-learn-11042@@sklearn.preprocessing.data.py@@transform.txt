[THOUGHT]
The sparse CSR output has shape (1, 7), indptr [0 1], indices [4], data [1.]. That corresponds to a one‐hot encoding of a single sample with one categorical feature taking the value 4, and the encoder has 7 categories (0 through 6). Thus:

– n_features = 1  
– n_values_ = [7] so feature_indices_ = [0,7]  
– active_features_ = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] (nothing was dropped in 'auto' mode)  
– Transform input X must be a 2D integer array of shape (1,1) containing [[4]].
