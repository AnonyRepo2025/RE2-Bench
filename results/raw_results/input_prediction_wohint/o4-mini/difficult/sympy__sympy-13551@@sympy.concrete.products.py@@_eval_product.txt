[THOUGHT]
We see the final result has six factors:
  A*B,  A*B**2,  A*B**3
expanded as
  A * B * A * B**2 * A * B**3

The code path taken is the “dif.is_Integer” branch:

    dif = n – a
    return Mul(*(term.subs(k, a + i) for i in range(dif + 1)))

We therefore must have:
  • term.subs(k,1)  = conjugate(A)*conjugate(B)**1
  • term.subs(k,2)  = conjugate(A)*conjugate(B)**2
  • term.subs(k,3)  = conjugate(A)*conjugate(B)**3

That is achieved by
  term = conjugate(A)*conjugate(B)**k
with limits (k, a, n) = (k, 1, 3).  Then dif = 3–1 = 2, so we get factors at k=1,2,3 as above.
