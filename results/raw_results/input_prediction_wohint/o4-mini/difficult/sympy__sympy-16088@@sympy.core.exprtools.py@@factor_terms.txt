[THOUGHT]
The `factor_terms` function sympifies its input expression and then factors out any common content. If there are no common factors to pull out, it simply returns the original expression unchanged. Given that the output is exactly

  R3 + R4 + 4050

and no factoring has taken place, the simplest and most direct input that would reproduce that output is the identical expression. All the optional boolean flags (`radical`, `clear`, `fraction`, `sign`) are left at their default values (`False`, `False`, `False`, `True` respectively).
