[THOUGHT]
The function only replaces named-group constructs of the form `(?P<name>pattern)` with the group name (including angle brackets). Since the output contains no angle brackets or any replaced segments, no named groups must have been present. Thus the input pattern must be unchanged. The function was called with the pattern `"admin/password_change/done/"`, and it returned it verbatim.
