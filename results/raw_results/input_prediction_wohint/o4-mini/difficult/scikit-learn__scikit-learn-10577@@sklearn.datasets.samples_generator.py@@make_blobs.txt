[THOUGHT]
The result is 8 samples in 2D, with labels only 0 and 1, and 5 zeros vs. 3 ones. That implies the user passed n_samples as an iterable [5, 3] (rather than an integer), giving 2 centers and exactly 5 points in cluster 0 and 3 in cluster 1.

The cluster centers themselves were not supplied, so centers=None, and they were drawn uniformly from the default center_box (–10, 10). Given the reproducible output, a fixed random_state was used. Comparing the empirical cluster means (~[1.415, 4.737] and ~[1.806, 0.763]) to what one gets with np.random.RandomState(0).uniform(–10,10) (≈[0.976,4.304] and ≈[2.055,0.898]) shows consistency with random_state=0 and default cluster_std=1.0.

Shuffle is True by default (and we see the samples were shuffled). All other parameters are defaults (n_features=2, cluster_std=1.0, center_box=(–10.0,10.0)).

Thus the call must have been something like:
make_blobs(n_samples=[5,3], random_state=0)
