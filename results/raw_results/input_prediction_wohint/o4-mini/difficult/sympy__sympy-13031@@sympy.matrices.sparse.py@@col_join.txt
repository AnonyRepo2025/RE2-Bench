[THOUGHT]
The `col_join` method stacks two matrices A (self) and B (other) vertically. The result has
rows = A.rows + B.rows and cols = A.cols = B.cols, and its `_smat` contains
- all entries of A at their original (i,j),
- all entries of B at (i + A.rows, j).

We observe the output has rows=2, cols=1, and entries
  (0,0): 1
  (1,0): 2

A simple choice is A.rows = 1, B.rows = 1, both cols = 1:
- A must have `_smat = {(0,0):1}`
- B must have `_smat = {(0,0):2}`

Joining A (1×1) above B (1×1) gives a 2×1 matrix with exactly the observed entries.
