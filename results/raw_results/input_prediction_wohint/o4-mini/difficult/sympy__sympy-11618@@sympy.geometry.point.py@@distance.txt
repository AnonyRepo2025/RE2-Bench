[THOUGHT]
We need two “Point”s whose Euclidean distance is √17/2, i.e. whose squared‐distance is 17/4. The simplest choice is   
  Point A = (0,0)  
  Point B = (½, 2)  
since (½−0)² + (2−0)² = 1/4 + 4 = 17/4, and sqrt(17/4) = √17/2.  
Thus we call A.distance(B). In JSON we represent each Point by its `.args`.
