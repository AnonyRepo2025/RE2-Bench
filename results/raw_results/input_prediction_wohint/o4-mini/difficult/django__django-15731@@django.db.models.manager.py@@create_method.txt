[THOUGHT]
The decorator `@wraps(method)` sets the wrapper function’s `__wrapped__` attribute to exactly the original `method` object, and does not add any other entries to its `__dict__`. When you inspect the resulting wrapper’s `__dict__` and JSON-serialize it, you see  
{"__wrapped__": {}}  
because the original `method` object has no custom attributes of its own, so it too serializes to `{}`.  

Hence the only inputs to `create_method` needed to produce that output are:  
- `name`: the name of the method being wrapped (this does not affect the wrapper’s `__dict__`),  
- `method`: a function object with no custom attributes (appearing as `{}` in JSON).  

A representative example, wrapping the common QuerySet method `"filter"`, would be:

[INPUT]
{
  "name": "filter",
  "method": {}
}
