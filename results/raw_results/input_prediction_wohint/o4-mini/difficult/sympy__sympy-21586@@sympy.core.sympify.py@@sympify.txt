[THOUGHT]
The test‚Äêharness key `_args_set` records the `repr(a)` that was passed into `sympify`. Since `_args_set` is the string  
  "{'2.00000000000000', '3'}"  
that means the positional argument `a` was the Python set  
  {"2.00000000000000", "3"}  
All other parameters (`locals`, `convert_xor`, `strict`, `rational`, `evaluate`) were left at their defaults, so only `a` needs to be specified.
