1. The returned loss is 2.2204460492503136e-16, which is exactly machine epsilon for float64.  
2. In the code, when `eps='auto'`, it becomes `np.finfo(y_pred.dtype).eps`.  
3. For a perfect prediction of a single-sample binary classification, say `y_true = [1]` and `y_pred = [1.0]`, the steps are:
   - Clip `y_pred` to `[eps, 1 – eps]`, giving `[1 – eps]`.  
   - After reshaping and appending the complement, `y_pred` becomes `[[eps, 1 – eps]]`.  
   - `transformed_labels` for `y_true = [1]` becomes `[[0, 1]]`.  
   - The log‐loss is `−log(1 – eps) ≈ eps`.  
4. With one sample and `normalize=True`, the mean loss is `eps`.  
Therefore the simplest input producing this output is:
   y_true = [1], y_pred = [1.0]
