[THOUGHT]
From the provided attributes we can read off exactly the values of the constructor parameters (all the `self.*` fields that are set in `__init__`).  These are the inputs to the `BayesianRidge` object *before* calling `fit`.  

The only other inputs to `fit` are `X`, `y`, and an optional `sample_weight`.  Since `compute_score=False`, we know no scores were recorded, and since `sample_weight` was never mentioned, we infer `sample_weight=None`.  

We cannot recover the exact numerical contents of `X` and `y` just from the final fitted parameters—many different datasets could lead to the same posterior means and variances—but we do know that they must be 2D/1D arrays of `dtype=np.float64` and compatible shapes.  In JSON we will therefore leave them as placeholders.

Putting this together, the call to `fit` must have looked like:

  model = BayesianRidge(
      n_iter=300,
      tol=0.001,
      alpha_1=1e-6,
      alpha_2=1e-6,
      lambda_1=1e-6,
      lambda_2=1e-6,
      alpha_init=None,
      lambda_init=None,
      compute_score=False,
      fit_intercept=True,
      normalize=False,
      copy_X=True,
      verbose=False
  )
  model.fit(X, y)

with `sample_weight=None`.
