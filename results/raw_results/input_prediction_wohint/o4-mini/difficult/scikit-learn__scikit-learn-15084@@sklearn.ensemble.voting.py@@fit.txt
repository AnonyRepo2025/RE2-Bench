[THOUGHT]
The JSON shown must be the `self`‐object returned by `fit`, so all of its attributes after fitting are

- estimators: None  
- weights:    None  
- n_jobs:      None  
- estimators_: None  
- named_estimators_: {}

Since `fit` returns `self`, the input `self` must have had exactly those same initial attribute values. The signature of `fit` is `fit(self, X, y, sample_weight=None)`.  No changes to those attributes implies there were no estimators to train (i.e. `self.estimators is None`), so the loops in `fit` did nothing.  We can therefore reconstruct the input call as passing in empty data arrays (so that nothing happens) and leaving `sample_weight` at its default.

Thus the call was effectively:

   self = { estimators=None, weights=None, n_jobs=None, … }  
   X = []  
   y = []  

and no extra kwargs.
