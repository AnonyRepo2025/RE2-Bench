1. `_osborne(e, d)` applies `bottom_up` with `f` that only transforms `HyperbolicFunction` nodes.  
2. The output is `2*I*sin(2*_Dummy_588)`, i.e. a `Mul(2, I*sin(2*_Dummy_588))`.  
3. That `sin` must have come from a `sinh` in the input, since `f` maps `sinh(a)` to `I*sin(a*d)`.  
4. Let the original node be `sinh(orig_arg)`.  After transformation:
    - `a = orig_arg`
    - `a = a * d`
    - `f` returns `I*sin(a)`  
5. The overall `2*â€¦` factor in the result must come from an outer `Mul(2, sinh(orig_arg))` in the input.  
6. We see `sin(2*_Dummy_588)`, so `a*d = 2*_Dummy_588`.  The simplest choice is  
    - `orig_arg = 2*_Dummy_588`  
    - `d = 1`  
   giving `a = 2*_Dummy_588*1`, and thus `I*sin(2*_Dummy_588)`.  
7. Therefore the original expression `e` was `2*sinh(2*_Dummy_588)`, with `d = 1`.
