[THOUGHT]
1. The returned x_weights has shape (3, 1), so X must be a 2D array with 3 columns.  
2. The returned y_weights has shape (2, 1), so Y must be a 2D array with 2 columns.  
3. The iteration count ite = 4 tells us convergence happened on the 4th loop, which matches using the default parameters (mode='A', max_iter=500, tol=1e-6, norm_y_weights=False) and Y.shape[1]â‰ 1.  
4. Therefore the call must have been something like  
   _nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop(X, Y)  
   with default keyword arguments.
