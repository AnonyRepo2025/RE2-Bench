[THOUGHT]
We know that `_complement(self, other)` in the FiniteSet‐case returns the elements of `other` that are not contained in `self`.  In code:

    sifted = sift(other, λel: self.contains(el))
    return Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), …)

When `sifted[None]` is empty this collapses to just `FiniteSet(*sifted[False])`.  Our observed output is a `FiniteSet` whose internal `_elements` is `frozenset({10, 15})`.  That means

– `other` must have been a `FiniteSet` containing at least 10 and 15,  
– and `self.contains(10)` and `self.contains(15)` must both have returned `False`,  
– and there must have been no “None” cases so that only the first part survives.

The simplest choice is to take `self` to be the empty set, so that every `.contains(el)` is `False`, and `other` to be exactly the set `{10, 15}`.  Then

    _complement(EmptySet, FiniteSet(10,15))

yields `FiniteSet(10,15)`, as required.
