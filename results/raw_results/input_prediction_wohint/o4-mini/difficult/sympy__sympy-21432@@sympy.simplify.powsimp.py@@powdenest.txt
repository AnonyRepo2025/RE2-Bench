[THOUGHT]
1. With force=False and polar=False (the defaults), the function falls through to  
   new = powsimp(sympify(eq))  
   return new.xreplace(Transform(...))  
2. If eq contains no powers or exponentials, powsimp(sympify(eq)) just returns eq sympified.  
3. To get the output printed as “_x”, eq can be the string "_x", which sympify turns into a Symbol named `_x`.  
4. Thus calling powdenest(eq="_x") with the default flags yields the Symbol `_x` as output.
