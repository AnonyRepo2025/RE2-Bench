The code prints 2*K−1 lines (one per X[i]). Our observed output is a single “0”, so 2*K−1 must equal 1 ⇒ K=1.  
With K=1, the loop over k runs once (k=2), computing S which becomes X[0], and then prints X[0]. We need S=0.  
Specializing to K=1 gives
  S = ∑_{m=0..min(1,⌊N/2⌋)} (−1)^m · invf[m]·invf[1−m].
For N≥2, this sum is 1−1=0. For N<2 it is 1.  
Thus any N≥2 works; the smallest choice is N=2.  
Therefore the single input line “1 2” yields exactly one printed “0”.
