1. The JSON output  
   ```json
   {
     "output": [
       null,
       null
     ]
   }
   ```
   means that the Python return value of `args_cnc` was the tuple `(None, None)`.  
2. The implementation of `args_cnc` is:
   ```python
   def args_cnc(self, **kwargs):
       coeff, matrices = self.as_coeff_matrices()
       coeff_c, coeff_nc = coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)
       if coeff_c == [1]:
           coeff_c = []
       elif coeff_c == set([1]):
           coeff_c = set()
       return (coeff_c, coeff_nc + matrices)
   ```
3. In normal operation `coeff` is a `Mul` (possibly the identity `1`), and `coeff.args_cnc(...)` returns two sequences; likewise `matrices` is a list. That would produce lists or sets, not `None`. The only way for both returned elements to be `None` is for the call  
   ```python
   coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)
   ```  
   itself to return `(None, None)`, and for `matrices` to be `None` so that `coeff_nc + matrices` is also `None` (i.e. no list concatenation ever happens).  
4. The simplest scenario is that the `MatMul` instance has been constructed so that its `as_coeff_matrices()` method returns `(None, None)`, and that no extra keyword‚Äêarguments are passed through.  
5. Therefore the input to `args_cnc` must have been a `MatMul` whose `as_coeff_matrices()` returns `(None, None)`, and with empty `kwargs`. For the purposes of the JSON input, we only need to specify `self` and `kwargs`.
