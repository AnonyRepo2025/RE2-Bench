[THOUGHT]
The method `_get_kernel_params` takes no arguments besides `self`, so its “input” is just the state of the estimator.  It returns a dict containing only the non‐None attributes named in `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]`.  
The output shown is

```
{
    "coef0": 0.1,
    "degree": 3.1
}
```

which implies:
- `self.kernel` is a string key for which `"coef0"` and `"degree"` are in `KERNEL_PARAMS[kernel]`.  In SciPy/Scikit‐learn this is `"poly"` (whose params are `["degree","gamma","coef0"]`).
- `self.coef0 == 0.1` and `self.degree == 3.1`
- `self.gamma` must be `None` (otherwise `"gamma"` would also appear)
- `self.kernel_params` must be `None` (so we start from an empty dict)

No other state influences the output.
