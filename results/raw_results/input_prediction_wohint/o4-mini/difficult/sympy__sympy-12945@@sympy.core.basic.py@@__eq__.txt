[THOUGHT]
We need two SymPy objects for which Basic.__eq__ returns True.  One convenient path is the special Pow‚Äêcase:

  if type(self) is not type(other):
      if isinstance(self, Pow) and self.exp == 1:
          return self.base == other

So let self = x**1 (a Pow with exponent 1) and other = x (a Symbol).  
Then __eq__ will take that branch, compare self.base (which is x) to other (x), and return True.
