[THOUGHT]
The function first simplifies the input and then checks if the symbol is in `f.free_symbols`. Since the output is `2*pi`, it must have taken the branch for a `TrigonometricFunction` where
```
if isinstance(f, TrigonometricFunction):
    period = f.period(symbol)
```
and for standard trig functions like `sin(x)` or `cos(x)`, `f.period(x)` returns `2*pi`. The simplest choice is
f = sin(x)
symbol = x
and leaving `check=False` (the default) so that it directly returns the period without verification.
