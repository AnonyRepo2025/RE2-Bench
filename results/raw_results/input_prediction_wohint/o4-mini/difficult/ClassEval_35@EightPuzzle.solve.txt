[THOUGHT]
The solve method initializes open_list with (initial_state, []). It immediately pops this, compares current_state to goal_state ([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]]). Since the returned path is empty (output `[]`), the initial_state must already equal the goal_state, causing an immediate return of the empty path. No arguments are passed to `solve`.
