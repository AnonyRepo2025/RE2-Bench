The output is a (11×2) csr_matrix whose first four rows are non‐zero and rows 4–10 are empty.  Examining the non‐zero rows:

Row 0 has two entries 0.91299955 at col 0 and 0.40796057 at col 1, row 1 has 0.74563614 and 0.66635332, row 2 has 0.48826456 and 0.87269566, and row 3 has a single 1.0 at col 1.  These are L₂‐normalized versions of the TF×IDF values.  Let X be the raw term‐count matrix and idf = [idf₀, idf₁].  Then each non‐zero row i is

  vᵢ = (Xᵢ·diag(idf)) / ‖Xᵢ·diag(idf)‖₂.

The ratio v₁/v₀ doubles going from row 0→1→2, suggesting X counts of feature 1 doubling (1,2,4) vs. feature 0 constant (1) in the first three docs.  Row 3 has only feature 1 (count 8, so only that entry survives L₂‐norm to 1), and rows 4–10 are zero documents.  We can choose idf₀=1.0 and idf₁≈0.4467 to reproduce the given normalized values.  Hence the input to transform is:

self: a fitted TfidfTransformer with norm='l2', use_idf=True, smooth_idf=True, sublinear_tf=False, and _idf_diag = diag([1.0, 0.446699]).

X: the raw count matrix
[[1,1],

 [1,4],
 [0,8],
 [0,0],
 … (7 more [0,0] rows) …]

copy defaults to True.
