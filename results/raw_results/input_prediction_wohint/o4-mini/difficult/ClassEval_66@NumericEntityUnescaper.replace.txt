[THOUGHT]
The method scans the input string looking for sequences starting with "&#", then collects digits (decimal) or hex chars up to a semicolon, converts that numeric value to a character, appends it, and skips past the entity. To get output "ABC", the input must contain three numeric entities for code points 65, 66, 67. A straightforward choice is "&#65;&#66;&#67;". Each entity will be decoded in turn to "A", "B", and "C".
