[THOUGHT]
The `get_many` method builds a dict by iterating over the provided `keys`. It only adds entries when `self.get(key, self._missing_key)` returns something other than the missing‐key sentinel. To get an empty dict `{}`, the simplest case is that the `keys` list is empty, so the loop never runs and it returns `{}` immediately. No `version` argument is needed (it remains the default `None`).
