[THOUGHT]
We want the final returned value to be "http://www.example.com/category/". The code does:

1. value = super().to_python(value)  → leaves the string unchanged (or None).
2. If value is truthy, split_url(value) → urlsplit into (scheme, netloc, path, query, fragment).
3. If scheme is empty, set url_fields[0] = self.assume_scheme (defaults to "http").
4. If netloc is empty, promote the whole path into netloc, clear path, then rebuild and re‐split.
5. Finally urlunsplit on the (scheme, netloc, path, query, fragment).

To end up with a trailing slash in the path, the initial value must end with “/”.  
- If the input were "www.example.com/category/", then:
  - First split → ("", "", "www.example.com/category/", "", "")
  - scheme ← "http"
  - netloc ← "www.example.com/category/", path ← ""
  - urlunsplit → "http://www.example.com/category/"
  - split again → ("http", "www.example.com", "/category/", "", "")
  - urlunsplit → "http://www.example.com/category/"

If we started with a full URL ("http://.../category/"), the output would be identical, but the code would never hit the netloc‐empty branch. Both inputs yield the same final output. The more interesting transformation is when the user omits the scheme, so we infer the input was:

    "www.example.com/category/"

and the field’s assume_scheme is the default "http".
