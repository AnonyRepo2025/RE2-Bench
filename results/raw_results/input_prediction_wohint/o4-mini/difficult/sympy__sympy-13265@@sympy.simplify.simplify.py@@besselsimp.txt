[THOUGHT]
The output JSON shows that the returned object has an attribute `nargs` whose internal `_elements` is `frozenset({2})`. In SymPy, a call like `besselj(ν, z)` is a two‐argument Function and carries an attribute `.nargs = FiniteSet(2)` (whose `_elements` is `frozenset({2})`). None of the other replacements in `besselsimp` change a plain `besselj(ν, z)` call when ν is an integer not >1 or half‐integer, so it will be returned as‐is, exposing its `nargs` = {2}. Therefore a minimal input is something like `besselj(1, 2)`.
