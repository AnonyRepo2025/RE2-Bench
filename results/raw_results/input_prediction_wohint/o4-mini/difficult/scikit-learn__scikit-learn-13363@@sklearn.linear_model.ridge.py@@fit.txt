[THOUGHT]
The `fit` method signature is  
    def fit(self, X, y, sample_weight=None):  
From the output we see no `sample_weight` entry, so it must have been left as the default (`None`).  
All of the other keys up through `"random_state"` are simply the attributes on `self` that were set in the constructor.  
Therefore the input to `fit` was:
- self with those hyperparameter values  
- positional arguments `X` and `y` (both NumPy arrays, dtype float64, shapes (n_samples, 2) and (n_samples,), respectively)  
- no keyword arguments (or equivalently `sample_weight=None`)  

We cannot recover the exact numeric contents of `X` and `y` from just the fitted coefficients and intercept, but we know their types and that they were passed in as positional arguments.
