[THOUGHT]
We need an input to `answer` that yields `False`. The simplest case is when `self.nums` is empty (the default after construction) and we pass an expression that is not `"pass"` and does not evaluate to 24.

1. `expression != 'pass'`, so we skip the `pass` branch.
2. `statistic` remains empty since there are no digits in `self.nums` to match.
3. `nums_used` is also empty.
4. The loop `for num in self.nums:` does nothing because `self.nums` is emptyâ€”so we never return `False` there.
5. `all(count == 0 for count in nums_used.values())` is `True` (empty `nums_used`).
6. We call `evaluate_expression(expression)`. If `expression` is `"1+1"`, `eval("1+1")` is `2`, not `24`, so it returns `False`.

Thus `answer("1+1")` with an empty `self.nums` yields `False`, matching the given output.
