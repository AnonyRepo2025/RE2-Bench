[THOUGHT]
The fitted coefficients, intercept and residual sum‐of‐squares exactly match those obtained by regressing √y on the standard diabetes data (442 samples, 10 features) from sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes().  
– The regressor is a LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True, normalize=False, copy_X=True, n_jobs=None) trained on X of shape (442,10) and target √y.  
– The transformer was created with func=np.sqrt and inverse_func=np.log.  
– Hence the call must have been:
    self.fit(X, y)
with X and y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True).  
No fit_params were passed.
