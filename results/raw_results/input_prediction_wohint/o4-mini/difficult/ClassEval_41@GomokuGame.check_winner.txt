[THOUGHT]
The `check_winner` method scans the board for any sequence of five identical non-space symbols in one of four directions. To get the output `"O"`, we need a board containing at least one run of five `"O"`s in a row. The simplest case is a 5Ã—5 board whose first row is all `"O"` and all other cells are spaces. When `check_winner` inspects the cell at (0,0) with symbol `"O"` and direction (0,1), it will verify the next four cells in that row are also `"O"`, count to 5, and return `"O"`.
  
Thus, the `self` object must have:
- `"board_size": 5`
- `"board"` set to:
  [
    ["O","O","O","O","O"],
    [" "," "," "," "," "],
    [" "," "," "," "," "],
    [" "," "," "," "," "],
    [" "," "," "," "," "]
  ]
- `current_player` can remain `"X"` (unused by `check_winner`)

No additional args or kwargs are provided to `check_winner`.
