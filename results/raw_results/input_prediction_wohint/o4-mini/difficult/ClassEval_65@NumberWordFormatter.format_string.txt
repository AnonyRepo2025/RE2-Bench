[THOUGHT]
We need format_string(x) to produce exactly "ONE MILLION ONLY".  
– No cents part means rstr=='' (no fractional part).  
– The integer part must format to "ONE MILLION".  
The code splits into 3-digit groups from the right; to get "ONE MILLION", the number must be 1 000 000.  
Hence x should be the string "1000000".
