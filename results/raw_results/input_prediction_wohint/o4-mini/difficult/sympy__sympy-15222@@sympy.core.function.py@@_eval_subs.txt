[THOUGHT]
We see from the call‐trace that Sympy is handling a Subs object.  In its `_eval_subs` it does roughly:

  if old in self.variables:
      # find index, then
      return self.point()._subs(old, new)

Thus it never even looks at the “main” expression of the Subs – it simply substitutes inside the “point”.  The trace shows one call to `Basic._subs`, and that returns `new` iff the “point” equals `old`.  Since the final returned string is `"2*x"`, we must have:

  new = 2*x  
  old = self.point()

and `old in self.variables` must be true, so we choose

  self = Subs(ANY_EXPR, (old,), old)

so that `self.point() == old` and `old in self.variables`.  Substituting yields `2*x` exactly.

A minimal choice is:

  self = Subs(1, (x,), x)  
  old  = x  
  new  = 2*x

Then `_eval_subs(self, x, 2*x)` will return `2*x` as desired.
