[THOUGHT]
The function begins by checking `if cls is None or cls is NoneType: return ':py:obj:`None`'`.  
Since the observed output is exactly `":py:obj:`None`"`, the input must have satisfied that first condition.  
The simplest way (and the only JSON‚Äêserializable way) to trigger it is to pass cls = None.  
Thus the input JSON should set `"cls": null`.
