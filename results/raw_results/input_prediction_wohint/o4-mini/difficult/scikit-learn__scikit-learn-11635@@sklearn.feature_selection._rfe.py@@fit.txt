[THOUGHT]
We need X and y such that
- X has 4 features (since support_ and ranking_ are length 4) and at least 5 samples (cv=5 folds ⇒ n_samples ≥ 5).
- Initial RFE fit must produce coefficients whose magnitudes rank features 4>3>2>1, so ranking_ = [4,3,2,1].
- A simple choice is to make XᵀX = I₄ and Xᵀy = [1,2,3,4], so that the least-squares solution w = [1,2,3,4].
  This is achieved by taking 5 samples: the first four rows as the 4×4 identity matrix and a fifth zero row, and y = [1,2,3,4,0].
- Then RFE will eliminate the feature with smallest |coef| in order (1→2→3) and keep feature 4, giving ranking_ and support_ as observed.
- We pass groups=None, and the RFECV instance must have been initialized with the given parameters.

Therefore the call is rfecv.fit(X, y, groups=None) with:
X = [[1,0,0,0],
     [0,1,0,0],
     [0,0,1,0],
     [0,0,0,1],
     [0,0,0,0]]
y = [1,2,3,4,0]
