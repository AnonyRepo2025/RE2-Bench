We observe that the returned tick array is  
  [1.e-01, 1.e+00, 1.e+01, 1.e+02, 1.e+03, 1.e+04]  
i.e. 10⁻¹ through 10⁴.  

Looking at the code:

- b = self._base must be 10 so that 10ᵈ gives 0.1…10000.
- Since the ticks printed are exactly one per decade (no intermediate subs like 2×10ᵈ), we must be in the branch where have_subs is False, so that ticklocs = b**decades. That requires self._subs to be a sequence of length 1 containing 1.0 (not a string).
- The decades array is constructed as  
    decades = arange(floor(log_vmin) – stride, ceil(log_vmax) + 2·stride, stride)  
  and then ticklocs = b**decades.  
- We need decades = [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4].  arange(start, stop) yields integers start … stop–1.  
  So we want start = –1 and stop = 5.  
- Thus  
    floor(log_vmin) – stride = –1  
    ceil(log_vmax) + 2·stride = 5  
- Take stride = 1 (the natural choice when numdec//numticks + 1 = 1).  
- Then floor(log_vmin) = 0 ⇒ log_vmin ∈ [0,1), so vmin ∈ [1,10) (easiest pick vmin = 1.0).  
- And ceil(log_vmax) = 3 ⇒ log_vmax ∈ (2,3], so vmax ∈ (100,1000] (pick vmax = 1000.0).  
- With self.numticks == 'auto' and self.axis = None, numticks = 9, giving stride = numdec//9 + 1 = 3//9 + 1 = 1.  

All together, the minimal inputs are:

self.numticks = "auto"  
self.axis = null  
self._base = 10.0  
self._subs = [1.0]  

and the arguments vmin=1.0, vmax=1000.0 produce exactly the displayed ticks.
