[THOUGHT]
1. `encode_cf_datetime` returns a tuple `(num, units, calendar)`, which the output JSON shows as `["10", "days since 2000-01-01", "gregorian"]`.  
2. The returned `calendar` is `"gregorian"`. Since the default when `calendar=None` is `"proleptic_gregorian"`, the user must have passed `calendar="gregorian"` explicitly.  
3. The returned `units` are `"days since 2000-01-01"`. This could either have been inferred from the dates or provided directly; to keep things simple we assume it was passed in as that exact string.  
4. To get `num = 10`, the date(s) must be exactly 10 days after the reference date `2000-01-01`.  
5. Therefore the input `dates` can be a length‚Äê1 array containing the single timestamp `2000-01-11T00:00:00` (10 days after `2000-01-01`).  
6. Putting it all together, the function was called as  
     `encode_cf_datetime(dates, units="days since 2000-01-01", calendar="gregorian")`  
   with `dates = ["2000-01-11T00:00:00"]`.
