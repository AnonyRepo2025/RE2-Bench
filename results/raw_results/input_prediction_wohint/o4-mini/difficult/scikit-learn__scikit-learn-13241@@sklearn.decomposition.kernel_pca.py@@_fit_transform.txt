[THOUGHT]
The private method `_fit_transform(self, K)` is called with a single argument `K`, which is the kernel matrix computed by `_get_kernel(X)`.  It then centers `K` in place (via the `KernelCenterer`) and returns the centered matrix.  In this question the returned (centered) matrix is exactly the 5×5 array shown in the JSON under `"output"`.  Since that array is the very value returned by `_fit_transform`, and no other modification is done to the variable `K` after centering, the argument `K` inside `_fit_transform` must have been that same 5×5 array.  

Hence the call to `_fit_transform` must have looked like:

    self._fit_transform(K)

where `K` is the 5×5 matrix given.

We therefore wrap that matrix into the expected JSON format for the function call, with an (empty) `self` and no additional `kwargs`.
