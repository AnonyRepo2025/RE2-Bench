[THOUGHT]
The `Basic.__eq__` method will return True in two main cases:
1. `self is other` (identity).
2. `type(self) is type(other)` and `self._hashable_content() == other._hashable_content()`.

A simple illustration of case 2 is comparing two distinct `Symbol('x')` objects:
- They are not the same object, so the identity check fails.
- Their types are both `Symbol`.
- Their `_hashable_content()` is `('x',)` in both cases.

Thus `Symbol('x') == Symbol('x')` will invoke the final equality comparison and return True. 

We can use that as our input to `__eq__`.
