[THOUGHT]
1. The JSON shown corresponds to the attributes of the returned `new` scale object after `_setup` has run.  
2. We see  
   - `values` and `order` are still `null` ⇒ the original `self.values` and `self.order` must have been `None`, and `_setup` never touches them.  
   - `_tick_params` is `{"locator": null}` ⇒ the original `self._tick_params` must have been `None`, so the `if new._tick_params is None: new = new.tick()` branch ran, and `tick()` populated `locator` with `None`.  
   - `_label_params` is `{"formatter": null}` ⇒ similarly, the original `self._label_params` was `None`, so `label()` ran.  
   - `_legend` remains `[null, null]` ⇒ the `if prop.legend:` block must *not* have executed, so `prop.legend` was `False` and the original `self._legend` was `(None, None)`.  
   - `_matplotlib_scale`, `_pipeline`, and `_spacer` all get assigned inside `_setup`, but in the JSON they appear as `{}` or `null`, indicating that they were populated with objects or callables that couldn’t be serialized further.  
3. The call must have been with no explicit `axis` (so `axis=None`), a `data` argument that is a pandas `Series`, and a `prop` whose `.legend` attribute is `False`.  
4. Therefore, the inputs to `_setup` were:
   - `self` = a `Nominal` instance with  
     • `values=None`  
     • `order=None`  
     • `_tick_params=None`  
     • `_label_params=None`  
     • `_legend=(None, None)`  
     • the other internals unset (`_matplotlib_scale=None`, `_pipeline=None`, `_spacer=None`)  
   - `data` = some `pandas.Series`  
   - `prop` = a `Property` object with `legend=False`  
   - `axis` = `None`
