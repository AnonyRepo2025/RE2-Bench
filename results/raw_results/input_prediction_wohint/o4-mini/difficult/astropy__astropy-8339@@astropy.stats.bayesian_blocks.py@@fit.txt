[THOUGHT]
The `fit` method returns an array of “edges” marking the change‐points in the input time series t.  Here we see exactly the four returned values

  [4.36037718, 48.45689469, 52.59791734, 99.45505108]

Because the first returned edge is always t[0], and the last is always t[-1], it must be that

  t = [4.36037718, … , 99.45505108]

Further, the two interior returned values here coincide exactly with t[1] and t[2].  That can only happen if the algorithm chose change‐points at the bin‐boundaries immediately before and after those times, which in turn implies that no mid‐point values were actually selected (i.e. each block began exactly at some t[i]).  In order for that to happen the fitness computation must have found the optimal segmentation separating at t[1] and at t[2]—which means our input t must itself be

  t = [4.36037718, 48.45689469, 52.59791734, 99.45505108]

Since neither x nor sigma were specified in the output snippet, they must have been left at their default (None) and handled internally by `validate_input` (which would, for example, set σ to unity and x to counts or weights).  Thus the call was simply

  fit(t=[4.36037718, 48.45689469, 52.59791734, 99.45505108])

with x and sigma omitted (None).
