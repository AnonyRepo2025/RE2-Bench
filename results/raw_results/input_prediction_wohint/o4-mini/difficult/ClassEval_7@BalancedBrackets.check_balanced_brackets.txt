[THOUGHT]
The `check_balanced_brackets` method only uses `self.expr` (no additional args). It first strips out any non-bracket characters, then processes the remaining sequence. To get a return value of False without raising an exception, we need a sequence where a left bracket is closed by a non-matching right bracket. For example:
  expr = "(]"
After `clear_expr`, expr stays "(]".  
Iteration:
  ‘(’→ push '('  
  ‘]’→ pop '(' as Current_Brkt, but since '(' expects ')', we see ']' ≠ ')', so return False.  
Thus the input `expr` must be "(]".
