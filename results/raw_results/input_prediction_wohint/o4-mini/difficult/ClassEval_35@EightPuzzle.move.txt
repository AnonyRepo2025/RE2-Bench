[THOUGHT]
The output state is:
  [[1,6,2],
   [7,0,8],
   [4,5,3]]
The blank (0) is at position (1,1) in the output. In the `move` method, if we move the blank “down,” that means in the original state the blank was one row above, at (0,1), and it swapped with the tile at (1,1).

Let original state be S. After `move(S, 'down')`:
  new_state[0][1] = S[1][1]
  new_state[1][1] = S[0][1] = 0

We know new_state is the given output. So:
  new_state[0][1] = 6 ⇒ S[1][1] = 6
  new_state[1][1] = 0 ⇒ S[0][1] = 0

All other positions are unchanged. Therefore the original state S must be:
  [[1, 0, 2],
   [7, 6, 8],
   [4, 5, 3]]

Thus the call was `move(state, "down")` on an instance whose `initial_state` could be the same S (the method doesn’t actually use `initial_state`).
