[THOUGHT]
The method `generate_primes` returns all prime numbers from 2 up to and including `self.n`. To get the list [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13], `self.n` must be at least 13 (so 13 is included) and less than 17 (so 17 is excluded). The simplest choice is `n = 13`. The `generate_primes` method takes no additional arguments.
