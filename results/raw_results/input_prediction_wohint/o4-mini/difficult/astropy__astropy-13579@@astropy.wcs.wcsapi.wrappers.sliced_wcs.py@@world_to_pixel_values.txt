[THOUGHT]
The only way to get essentially zero pixel coordinates (up to 10⁻¹² floating‐point noise) is to feed exactly the world‐coordinate values that map back to pixel (0,0).  In other words, the user must have called

    world_to_pixel_values(0.0, 0.0)

so that both output axes come back as ~0.
