[THOUGHT]
The Django Library.simple_tag method has signature simple_tag(self, func=None, takes_context=None, name=None). When it is invoked without any arguments (as in the case that produces an empty JSON output `{}`), it means:

- `func` was not provided, so it defaults to None.
- `takes_context` and `name` were also not provided, so they default to None.
- No positional arguments were passed beyond `self`.
- No keyword arguments were passed.

The `self` is an instance of Library with its default state, i.e. empty `filters` and `tags` dicts.

Therefore the call was effectively:
   simple_tag(self, func=None, takes_context=None, name=None)
with no extra args or kwargs, and the Library object in its initial state. 

This corresponds to the following JSON input description.
