1. The output is a classification report for a multi-class classification problem.
2. The report includes precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class.
3. The last line is the average of these metrics over all classes.
4. The classes are blue, greengreengreengreengreen, and red.
5. The support for each class is the number of samples in the test set that belong to that class.
6. The precision for a class is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false positives.
7. The recall for a class is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives.
8. The f1-score for a class is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
9. The average precision, recall, and f1-score are the averages of these metrics over all classes.
10. The average support is the average of the support for each class.
11. The average precision, recall, and f1-score are weighted by the support of each class.
12. The average support is the total number of samples.
13. The average precision, recall, and f1-score are the same as the precision, recall, and f1-score of the average class.
14. The average support is the total number of samples.
15. The average precision, recall, and f1-score are the same as the precision, recall, and f1-score of the average class.
