The function `replace_unnamed_groups` is used to replace unnamed groups in a regex pattern with a placeholder. The input to this function is a regex pattern. The output is the same pattern with all unnamed groups replaced with a placeholder.

The input pattern "^a/?$" has one unnamed group, which is the "?" after "a". The function will replace this with a placeholder.
