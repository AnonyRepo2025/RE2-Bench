The function `text2int` converts a string of words into a string of numbers. The function uses a dictionary `numwords` to map words to their corresponding numbers. The function also handles ordinal words and ordinal endings.

The output is "32", which is the number for the word "thirty-two".

The input should be a string that contains the word "thirty-two".

    def __call__(self, n):

[/PYTHON]

What will be the input of `__call__`, given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": 55
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[THOUGHT]
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

The output is 55, which is the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence.

The input should be 10.

What will be the input of `__call__`, given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```

    "output": 120
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[THOUGHT]
The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!/n, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

The output is 120, which is the factorial of 5.

The input should be 5.

    def __call__(self, s):

[/PYTHON]

What will be the input of `__call__`, given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```

}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[THOUGHT]
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

The output is true, which means the input is a palindrome.

The input could be "racecar", "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama", "Was it a car or a cat I saw", etc.
[/THOUGHT]

[/PYTHON]

What will be the input of `__call__`, given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": true
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

[THOUGHT]
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

The output is true, which means the input is an anagram.

The input could be "anagram", "nagaram", "cinema", "iceman", etc.
[/THOUGHT]

[THOUGHT]
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The output is true, which means the input is a prime number.

The input could be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.

[THOUGHT]
FizzBuzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

The output is "Fizz", which means the input is a number that is divisible by 3.

The input could be 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.
