1. The output is a sparse matrix in CSR format. The matrix has 4 rows and 11 columns.
2. The indices array shows the column indices of the non-zero elements.
3. The indptr array shows the indices of the first element of each row in the indices array.
4. The data array shows the non-zero elements of the matrix.
5. The input to the transform function should be a list of raw documents.
6. The raw documents are the original texts that were used to create the matrix.
7. The vocabulary is the dictionary that maps the feature names to their indices.
8. The vocabulary is stored in the vocabulary_ attribute of the CountVectorizer.
9. The vocabulary_ attribute is a dictionary where the keys are the feature names and the values are the indices.
10. The feature names are the words that were used to create the matrix.
11. The feature names are the keys in the vocabulary_ attribute.
12. The feature names are the words that were used to create the matrix.
