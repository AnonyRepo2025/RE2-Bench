1. The `_eval_Eq` method is called when the `==` operator is used on two MatrixExpr objects.
2. The `_eval_Eq` method checks if the shapes of the two matrices are equal. If they are not, it returns False.
3. If the shapes are equal, it subtracts the two matrices and checks if the result is a ZeroMatrix. If it is, it returns True.
4. If the result is not a ZeroMatrix, it returns an Eq object.
5. To get the output as true, we need the shapes of the two matrices to be equal, and the difference of the two matrices to be a ZeroMatrix.
