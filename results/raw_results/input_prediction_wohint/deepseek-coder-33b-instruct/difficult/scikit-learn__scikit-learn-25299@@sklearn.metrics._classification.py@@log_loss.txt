1. The output is 2.2204460492503136e-16, which is a very small number. This means that the log loss is very small, which means that the model's predictions are very close to the true values.
2. To get this output, we need:
y_true and y_pred to be very close to each other.
3. y_true and y_pred are numpy arrays.
4. y_true and y_pred are 2D arrays.
5. y_true and y_pred have the same number of rows.
6. y_true and y_pred have the same number of columns.
7. y_true and y_pred have the same number of classes.
8. y_true and y_pred are normalized.

1. The output is [0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0001], which is a very small number. This means that the cross entropy is very small, which means that the model's predictions are very close to the true values.
