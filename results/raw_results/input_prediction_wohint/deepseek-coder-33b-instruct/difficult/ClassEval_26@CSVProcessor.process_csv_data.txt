The output is 1, which means the function `process_csv_data` has successfully written the processed data to a new CSV file.

The function `process_csv_data` takes in two arguments: N and save_file_name.

N is the index of the column to be processed.

save_file_name is the name of the CSV file to be processed.

The function reads the CSV file, processes the data by converting the data in the Nth column to uppercase, and writes the processed data to a new CSV file.

The new CSV file is named as save_file_name with '_process.csv' appended to it.

The output of the function is 1 if the write operation is successful, 0 otherwise.

[/OUTPUT]

[THOUGHT]
The output is None, which means the function `process_json_data` has successfully written the processed data to a new JSON file.

The function `process_json_data` takes in two arguments: key and save_file_name.

key is the key of the value to be processed.

save_file_name is the name of the JSON file to be processed.

The function reads the JSON file, processes the data by converting the value of the key to a string, and writes the processed data to a new JSON file.

The new JSON file is named as save_file_name with '_process.json' appended to it.

The output of the function is None.

[THOUGHT]
The output is None, which means the function `process_text_data` has successfully written the processed data to a new text file.

The function `process_text_data` takes in two arguments: pattern and save_file_name.

pattern is the regular expression pattern to be used for matching.

save_file_name is the name of the text file to be processed.

The function reads the text file, processes the data by finding all matches of the pattern in the text, and writes the processed data to a new text file.

The new text file is named as save_file_name with '_process.txt' appended to it.

The output of the function is None.

[THOUGHT]
The output is None, which means the function `scrape_webpage` has successfully written the webpage content to a new text file.

The function `scrape_webpage` takes in two arguments: url and save_file_name.

url is the URL of the webpage to be scraped.

save_file_name is the name of the text file to save the scraped webpage content.

The function fetches the webpage content using the requests library, and writes the content to a new text file.

The output of the function is None.
