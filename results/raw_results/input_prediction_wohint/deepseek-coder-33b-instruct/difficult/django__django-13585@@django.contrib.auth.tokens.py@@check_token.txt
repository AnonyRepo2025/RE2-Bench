1. The function `check_token` returns True if the token is valid and False otherwise.
2. To get True, we need to pass a user object and a valid token.
3. The token is generated by `_make_token_with_timestamp`, which is a combination of a timestamp and a hash.
4. The timestamp is generated by `_num_seconds`, which is the number of seconds since 2001-01-01.
5. The hash is generated by `salted_hmac`, which is a HMAC of a secret key and a value.
6. The value is generated by `_make_hash_value`, which is a combination of the user's primary key, password, last login timestamp, timestamp, and email.
7. The secret key is `SECRET_KEY`, which is a required setting.
8. The user's primary key, password, last login timestamp, timestamp, and email can be any valid values.

[THOUGHT]
1. The function `find_min` returns the minimum number in a rotated sorted list.
2. The list is rotated at some pivot, so the minimum number is the first number that is smaller than its previous number.
3. The list is sorted in ascending order, so the minimum number is the first number.
4. The list is rotated at the first number, so the minimum number is the first number.
5. The list is not empty, so the minimum number is the first number.
