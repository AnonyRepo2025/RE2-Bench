The function `replace_named_groups` is used to replace named groups in a regex pattern with the name of the group. The input to this function is a regex pattern.

The output of the function is "admin/password_change/done/". This is the result of replacing named groups in a regex pattern with the name of the group.

The named groups in the regex pattern are "<username>" and "<token>". The named groups are replaced with their names in the output.

So, the input to the function `replace_named_groups` is the regex pattern "^password/reset/(?P<uidb64>[0-9A-Za-z_\-]+)/(?P<token>[0-9A-Za-z]{1,13}-[0-9A-Za-z]{1,20})/$".
