The output is [1, 3, 3], which means the function appended 3 to the list twice.
The function checks if a number is divisible by 3 and if it is, it appends it to the list.
The input list is [1, 3, 3], so the function must have checked the first and second elements.
The first element is not divisible by 3, so the function did not append anything.
The second element is divisible by 3, so the function appended it to the list.
The function then checked the third element, which is the same as the second element.
The third element is divisible by 3, so the function appended it to the list.
So the input list must have been [1, 3, 3].

[/OUTPUT]

[THOUGHT]
The output is [2, 6, 4], which means the function doubled the first and third elements and left the second element unchanged.
The function checks if a number is even and if it is, it doubles it.
The input list is [1, 3, 2], so the function must have checked the first, second, and third elements.
The first element is even, so the function doubled it.
The second element is not even, so the function left it unchanged.
The third element is even, so the function doubled it.
So the input list must have been [1, 3, 2].

[THOUGHT]
The output is [3, 9, 6], which means the function tripled the first and third elements and doubled the second element.
The function checks if a number is even and if it is, it doubles it, otherwise it triples it.
The input list is [1, 3, 2], so the function must have checked the first, second, and third elements.
