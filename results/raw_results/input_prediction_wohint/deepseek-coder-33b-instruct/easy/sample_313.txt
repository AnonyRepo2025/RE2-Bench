The output is "urecord". This means the string "urecord" is the result of the function.
The function `ljust` is used to left-justify the string in a field of width `l`, padding with '=' if necessary.
The function `rpartition` is used to split the string into a tuple containing the part before the last occurrence of '=', the separator itself, and the part after the separator.
From the output, we can infer that the string before the last '=' is "urecord".
