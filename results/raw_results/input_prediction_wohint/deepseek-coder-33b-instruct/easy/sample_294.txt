The output is "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris". This means that the first character, the middle characters, and the last character of the input text have been replaced with '2'.
The middle characters are replaced with '$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris' - '2' - '2', which is '$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris'.
The first and last characters are '2', so the input text must be '2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris2'.
