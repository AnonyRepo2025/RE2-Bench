The function `f` is replacing all occurrences of a word with a space, both when it is preceded by a hyphen and when it is followed by a hyphen.
The output is "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.", which suggests that the word "soup" was removed from the string.
This suggests that the input string must have contained "soup-" or "-soup" somewhere in it.

The function `f` is replacing all occurrences of a hyphen with a space, and then replacing all occurrences of two spaces with one space.
The output is "stew corn and beans in soup.", which suggests that the input string must have contained one or more hyphens and possibly some double spaces.
