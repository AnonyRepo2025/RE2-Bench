The `__hash__` method is used to compute a hash value for an object. The hash value is used for quick comparison of dictionary keys. The hash value of an object is an integer. The hash value of an object is the same during its lifetime.

The output of `__hash__` is -8736153336041072635, which is a negative integer. This means that the object is not hashable.

The input of `__hash__` is the object itself. Since the output is a negative integer, the object is not hashable.
