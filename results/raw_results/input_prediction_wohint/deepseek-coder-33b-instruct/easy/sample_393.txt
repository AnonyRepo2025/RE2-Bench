The output is "a---c---s". This means that the function is splitting the input string into groups of 3 characters, reversing the order of the characters in each group, and joining them with "---".
The last group of characters is "sac", which reversed is "c-s-a".
The second to last group of characters is "t", which reversed is "t".
The first group of characters is "e", which reversed is "e".
So, the input string must be "e---t---c-s-a".

What will be the input of `f` given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
}

[/OUTPUT]

[THOUGHT]
The output is a list of even numbers from 0 to 8. This means the input must be 10, because 10 is the first number greater than 8 that is a multiple of 2.
