The `_eval_is_real` method is called on an instance of the `sinh` class, which is a subclass of `HyperbolicFunction`. The `_eval_is_real` method is expected to return a boolean indicating whether the function is real-valued or not.

Given the output `true`, we can infer that the input to `_eval_is_real` is such that the argument of the `sinh` function is real.
