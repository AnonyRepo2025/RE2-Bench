The output list has 10 elements. The input list must have had an even number of elements, because each element from the input list is duplicated and inserted into the output list.
The last element of the output list is the first element of the input list.
The first element of the output list is the first element of the input list.
The second element of the output list is the second element of the input list.
The third element of the output list is the first element of the input list.
The fourth element of the output list is the third element of the input list.
The fifth element of the output list is the fourth element of the input list.
The sixth element of the output list is the fifth element of the input list.
The seventh element of the output list is the sixth element of the input list.
The eighth element of the output list is the first element of the input list.
The ninth element of the output list is the seventh element of the input list.
The tenth element of the output list is the eighth element of the input list.
