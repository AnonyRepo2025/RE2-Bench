The function `_eval_is_finite` is a method of the `HyperbolicFunction` class. It checks if the argument of the function is finite.

To get `output` as `true`, we need to ensure that the argument of the function is finite.

The function `h(x)` is the sum of `f(x)` and `g(x)`.

To get `output` as `10`, we need to find `x` such that `f(x)` and `g(x)` are `3` and `7` respectively.
