From `return 'error'` we can know that the function returned 'error'.
This means that either `i in target` or `i.index('.') == len(i) - 1 or i.index('.') == 0` was true.
From `i in target` we can know that `i` was in `target`.
From `i.index('.') == len(i) - 1 or i.index('.') == 0` we can know that `i` started or ended with a '.'.
