The function `f` takes a list of two elements. The first element is a string of length 1, and the second element is a list of strings.
The output is a list of two elements. The first element is a string of length 1, and the second element is a string of length 1.
The first element of the output is the first character of the first element of the input.
The second element of the output is the first character of the reversed second element of the input.
