The output is 0.6666666666666666, which is the mean absolute deviation of the input list. 
The mean absolute deviation is the average of the absolute differences from the mean of the numbers. 
The mean of the numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers. 
The absolute difference from the mean is the absolute value of the difference between a number and the mean. 
The mean absolute deviation is the sum of these absolute differences divided by the count of the numbers.
