The output is a list of lists, where each inner list is a key-value pair. The first element of each inner list is a string, and the second element is an integer.
The output is sorted by the first element of each inner list, which is a string.
The string "a" comes before "b" in lexicographical order, so "a" should come before "b" in the output.
The integer 2 comes after 1, so 2 should come after 1 in the output.

What will be the input of `f` given the following output:
[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": [
        2,
        4,
        6

[/OUTPUT]

[THOUGHT]
The output is a list of even numbers.
The input list must contain at least the numbers 2, 4, and 6.
The numbers 2, 4, and 6 are even, so they should be in the output.
