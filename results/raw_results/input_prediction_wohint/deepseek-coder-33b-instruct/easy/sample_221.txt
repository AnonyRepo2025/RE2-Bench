The output is a string that starts with a dot. This means the second part of the split string (the second part of the text) starts with a dot.
The output is 9 characters long. This means the second part of the split string (the second part of the text) is 8 characters long.
The output is "bpxa24fc5". This means the second part of the split string (the second part of the text) is "bpxa24fc5".
The output is "fc5". This means the first part of the split string (the first part of the text) is "fc5".
