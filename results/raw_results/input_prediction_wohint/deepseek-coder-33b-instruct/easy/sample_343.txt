The output is a list of lists and integers. The first list is [1, 2, 3], the second list is [1, 2], and the last list is [2, 1]. The integers are 1 and 3. 

The function `f` takes two arguments: an array and an element. It extends the array with the element. 

The output is a list of the array after each call to `f`. 

The first call to `f` has the array [1, 2, 3] and the element [1, 2]. The second call has the array [1, 2, 3, 1, 2] and the element 1. The third call has the array [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1] and the element 3. The last call has the array [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3] and the element [2, 1].
