The function `extract_file` is trying to extract a file from a zip archive. The function takes two arguments: `file_name` and `output_path`.

The `file_name` is the name of the file to be extracted from the zip archive. The `output_path` is the path where the extracted file will be saved.

The output of the function is a boolean value indicating whether the file was successfully extracted or not.

Given the output is `true`, it means the file was successfully extracted.
