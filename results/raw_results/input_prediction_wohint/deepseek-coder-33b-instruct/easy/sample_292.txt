The output is a string where each digit in the input is replaced by '*'. 
This means that the input string must have been "58323***". 
The only way to get this output is if the input string was "58323***" and no other characters were replaced.

What will be the input of `f` given the following output:
[OUTPUT]

The output is 10, which is double of the input. 
So, the input must have been 5.
