The output is a list of numbers. The function `f` is inserting elements from the list into itself, starting from the given index.
The output list has 3 elements, so the input list must have at least 3 elements.
The first element of the output list is -2, which is the first element of the input list after inserting elements from the input list starting from the index.
The second element of the output list is 4, which is the second element of the input list after inserting elements from the input list starting from the index.
The third element of the output list is -4, which is the third element of the input list after inserting elements from the input list starting from the index.
