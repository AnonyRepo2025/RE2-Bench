From `ans = N // (A + B) * A`, we can know that `ans` is the product of the quotient of `N` divided by `(A + B)` and `A`.
From `rem = N % (A + B)`, we can know that `rem` is the remainder of `N` divided by `(A + B)`.
From `ans += min(rem, A)`, we can know that `ans` is increased by the minimum of `rem` and `A`.
From `print(ans)`, we can know that the output is `ans`.
From the output `0`, we can know that `ans` is `0`.
From `ans = N // (A + B) * A`, we can know that `N` is a multiple of `(A + B)`.
From `rem = N % (A + B)`, we can know that `rem` is less than or equal to `A`.
From the above, we can reconstruct: `N = (A + B) * 0`, `rem = 0`.
This means the input must have been `0 1 1`.

From `dp[0] = 1`, we can know that there is one way to make up 0.
From `dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - a[i]]) % 1000000007`, we can know that `dp[j]` is the sum of `dp[j]` and `dp[j - a[i]]` modulo 1000000007.
From `return dp[m]`, we can know that the output is `dp[m]`.
From the output `1`, we can know that `dp[m]` is `1`.
From `dp[m]` is `1`, we can know that there is one way to make up `m`.
From the above, we can reconstruct: `m = 0`, `a = [1]`.
This means the input must have been `1 0\n1`.
