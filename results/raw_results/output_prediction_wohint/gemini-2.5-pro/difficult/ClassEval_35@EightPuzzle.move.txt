[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `move` method of the `EightPuzzle` class.

1.  **Function:** `move(self, state, direction)`
2.  **Inputs:**
    *   `self`: An instance of `EightPuzzle`. Its attributes are not directly used in the `move` logic, except for calling `self.find_blank`.
    *   `state`: `[[1, 6, 2], [7, 8, 0], [4, 5, 3]]`
    *   `direction`: `"left"`

3.  **Step-by-step execution of `move`:**
    *   `i, j = self.find_blank(state)`: The `find_blank` method is called with the input `state`. It will search for the number `0`.
        *   It iterates through the rows and columns.
        *   `state[0]` is `[1, 6, 2]`. No `0`.
        *   `state[1]` is `[7, 8, 0]`. The `0` is found at index `2`.
        *   The method returns the coordinates `(i, j) = (1, 2)`.
        *   So, `i` is set to `1` and `j` is set to `2`.
    *   `new_state = [row[:] for row in state]`: A deep copy of the input `state` is created.
        *   `new_state` is `[[1, 6, 2], [7, 8, 0], [4, 5, 3]]`.
    *   The code then checks the `direction`.
    *   `if direction == 'up'`: False.
    *   `elif direction == 'down'`: False.
    *   `elif direction == 'left'`: True. The code inside this block is executed.
        *   `new_state[i][j], new_state[i][j - 1] = (new_state[i][j - 1], new_state[i][j])`: This line swaps two elements.
        *   Substitute `i=1` and `j=2`:
            `new_state[1][2], new_state[1][1] = (new_state[1][1], new_state[1][2])`
        *   Let's see the values:
            *   `new_state[1][2]` is `0`.
            *   `new_state[1][1]` is `8`.
        *   The values `0` and `8` are swapped.
        *   The second row of `new_state`, which was `[7, 8, 0]`, becomes `[7, 0, 8]`.
        *   The full `new_state` is now `[[1, 6, 2], [7, 0, 8], [4, 5, 3]]`.
    *   `return new_state`: The function returns the modified `new_state`.

4.  **Final Output:** The returned value is `[[1, 6, 2], [7, 0, 8], [4, 5, 3]]`.
