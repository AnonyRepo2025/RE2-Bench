[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `text2int` method of the `Words2Numbers` class.

**Function:** `text2int`
**Input `textnum`:** `"thirty-two"`

Let's trace the execution of the `text2int` method step by step.

1.  **`textnum = textnum.replace('-', ' ')`**:
    -   The input `textnum` is "thirty-two".
    -   After this line, `textnum` becomes "thirty two".

2.  **Initialization of local variables:**
    -   `current = 0`
    -   `result = 0`
    -   `curstring = ''`
    -   `onnumber = False`

3.  **`for word in textnum.split():`**:
    -   `textnum.split()` results in the list `['thirty', 'two']`.
    -   The loop will execute twice, once for "thirty" and once for "two".

4.  **First iteration: `word = "thirty"`**
    -   `if word in self.ordinal_words:`: "thirty" is not a key in `self.ordinal_words`. This is false.
    -   The `else` block is executed.
    -   `for ending, replacement in self.ordinal_endings:`: The code checks if "thirty" ends with "ieth" or "th". It doesn't. The `word` remains "thirty".
    -   `if word not in self.numwords:`: The word "thirty" *is* a key in `self.numwords` (with value `[1, 30]`). This condition is false.
    -   The `else` block is executed.
        -   `scale, increment = self.numwords[word]`: `scale` becomes `1`, `increment` becomes `30`.
        -   `current = current * scale + increment`: `current = 0 * 1 + 30` -> `current` is now `30`.
        -   `if scale > 100:`: `1 > 100` is false.
        -   `onnumber = True`.

5.  **Second iteration: `word = "two"`**
    -   `if word in self.ordinal_words:`: "two" is not a key in `self.ordinal_words`. This is false.
    -   The `else` block is executed.
    -   `for ending, replacement in self.ordinal_endings:`: The word "two" does not end with "ieth" or "th". The `word` remains "two".
    -   `if word not in self.numwords:`: The word "two" *is* a key in `self.numwords` (with value `[1, 2]`). This condition is false.
    -   The `else` block is executed.
        -   `scale, increment = self.numwords[word]`: `scale` becomes `1`, `increment` becomes `2`.
        -   `current = current * scale + increment`: `current = 30 * 1 + 2` -> `current` is now `32`.
        -   `if scale > 100:`: `1 > 100` is false.
        -   `onnumber = True`.

6.  **End of the loop.**

7.  **`if onnumber:`**: The variable `onnumber` is `True`.
    -   `curstring += repr(result + current)`:
        -   `result` is `0`.
        -   `current` is `32`.
        -   `result + current` is `32`.
        -   `repr(32)` returns the string representation `'32'`.
        -   `curstring` becomes `'32'`.

8.  **`return curstring`**: The function returns the value of `curstring`, which is `'32'`.

The final output is the string "32".
