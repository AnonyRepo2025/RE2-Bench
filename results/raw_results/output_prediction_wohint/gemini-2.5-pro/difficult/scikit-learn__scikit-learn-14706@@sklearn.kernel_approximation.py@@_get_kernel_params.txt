The user wants me to predict the output of the `_get_kernel_params` method.

1.  **`params = self.kernel_params`**: `self.kernel_params` is `null` (which is `None` in Python). So, `params` is set to `None`.
2.  **`if params is None:`**: This condition is true.
3.  **`params = {}`**: `params` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
4.  **`if not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed':`**:
    *   `self.kernel` is the string `"polynomial"`.
    *   `callable("polynomial")` is `False`, so `not callable(...)` is `True`.
    *   `"polynomial" != 'precomputed'` is `True`.
    *   The entire condition is `True` (`True and True`). The code enters this `if` block.
5.  **`for param in KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]:`**:
    *   The code will iterate over the parameters associated with the `'polynomial'` kernel. Based on the `sklearn` library, `KERNEL_PARAMS['polynomial']` is a tuple `('gamma', 'degree', 'coef0')`.
6.  **First iteration: `param` is `'gamma'`**:
    *   **`if getattr(self, param) is not None:`**: This checks if `self.gamma` is not `None`.
    *   `self.gamma` is `null` (i.e., `None`). The condition is `False`.
7.  **Second iteration: `param` is `'degree'`**:
    *   **`if getattr(self, param) is not None:`**: This checks if `self.degree` is not `None`.
    *   `self.degree` is `3.1`. The condition is `True`.
    *   **`params[param] = getattr(self, param)`**: `params['degree']` is set to `3.1`. `params` is now `{'degree': 3.1}`.
8.  **Third iteration: `param` is `'coef0'`**:
    *   **`if getattr(self, param) is not None:`**: This checks if `self.coef0` is not `None`.
    *   `self.coef0` is `0.1`. The condition is `True`.
    *   **`params[param] = getattr(self, param)`**: `params['coef0']` is set to `0.1`. `params` is now `{'degree': 3.1, 'coef0': 0.1}`.
9.  The `for` loop finishes.
10. **`elif self.gamma is not None or self.coef0 is not None or self.degree is not None:`**: This is an `elif` to the main `if` statement that was entered. Therefore, this block is skipped.
11. **`return params`**: The function returns the final `params` dictionary, which is `{'degree': 3.1, 'coef0': 0.1}`. The order of keys in the JSON output is not guaranteed, but the content is correct.

Final predicted output is a dictionary containing the non-null kernel parameters from the `self` object that are relevant to the 'polynomial' kernel.
