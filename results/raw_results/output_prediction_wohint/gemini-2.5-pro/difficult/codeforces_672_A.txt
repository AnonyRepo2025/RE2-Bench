[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the given Python script.

**1. Code Analysis:**
The script builds a list named `li`. It iterates through numbers from 1 to 370.
- For each 1-digit number `i`, it appends the number itself to `li`.
- For each 2-digit number `i`, it appends its digits individually to `li`.
- For each 3-digit number `i`, it also appends its digits individually to `li`.
After the loop, it removes the last two elements from `li`.
Finally, it reads an integer `n` from the input and prints the element at index `n-1` of the list `li`.

**2. Step-by-step Execution Simulation:**

*   **List `li` construction:**
    *   **Numbers 1-9 (1-digit):** The numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` are appended.
        *   `li` is now `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
        *   Length of `li` = 9.
    *   **Numbers 10-99 (2-digits):** The digits of each number are appended. For example, for `i=10`, `1` and `0` are appended. For `i=11`, `1` and `1` are appended.
        *   There are `99 - 10 + 1 = 90` two-digit numbers.
        *   Each contributes 2 digits, so `90 * 2 = 180` elements are added.
        *   After this stage, the length of `li` is `9 + 180 = 189`.
    *   **Numbers 100-370 (3-digits):** The digits of each number are appended. For example, for `i=100`, `1, 0, 0` are appended.
        *   The loop continues until `i=370`. The digits `3, 7, 0` are the last ones to be appended.
        *   The total number of 3-digit numbers processed is `370 - 100 + 1 = 271`.
        *   Each contributes 3 digits, so `271 * 3 = 813` elements are added.
        *   The total length of `li` after the loop is `189 + 813 = 1002`.
        *   The last three elements are `3, 7, 0`.

*   **`li.pop()` calls:**
    *   `li.pop()`: Removes the last element, which is `0`. `li` now ends with `..., 3, 7`.
    *   `li.pop()`: Removes the new last element, which is `7`. `li` now ends with `..., 3`.
    *   The final length of `li` is `1002 - 2 = 1000`.

*   **Input and Output:**
    *   `n = int(input(' '))`: The input is `"423"`, so `n` becomes `423`.
    *   `print(li[n - 1])`: The code will print the element at index `423 - 1 = 422`.

*   **Finding the element at index 422:**
    *   The first 9 elements (indices 0-8) are the single-digit numbers.
    *   The next 180 elements (indices 9-188) are the digits of 2-digit numbers.
    *   Our target index `422` is greater than 188, so it falls within the block of 3-digit numbers.
    *   The block of 3-digit numbers starts at index 189.
    *   Let's find the position relative to the start of this block: `422 - 189 = 233`.
    *   This means we are looking for the 234th element (since indexing is 0-based) in the sequence of digits from numbers 100, 101, 102, ...
    *   Each number contributes 3 digits. To find which number this index belongs to, we perform integer division: `233 // 3 = 77`.
    *   This means our index is in the 78th number (0-indexed `77`) after the start of the 3-digit sequence.
    *   The 3-digit sequence starts with `100`. The 78th number is `100 + 77 = 177`.
    *   To find which digit of `177` it is, we use the modulo operator: `233 % 3 = 2`.
    *   This means it's the 3rd digit (index 2) of the number `177`.
    *   The digits of `177` are `1, 7, 7`. The digit at index 2 is `7`.
    *   Therefore, `li[422]` is `7`.

*   **Final Prediction:**
    The script will print the integer `7`. The output format requires this to be a string.
