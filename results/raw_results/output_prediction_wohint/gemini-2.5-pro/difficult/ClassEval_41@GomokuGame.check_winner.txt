[THOUGHT]
1.  **Function:** `check_winner` in the `GomokuGame` class.
2.  **Input:** An instance of `GomokuGame` with a `board_size` of 10 and a pre-filled `board`.
3.  **Goal:** Determine if there is a winner on the board and return the winner's symbol ('X' or 'O') or `None`.

**Step-by-step execution of `check_winner`:**

1.  The method initializes `directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1)]`. These represent horizontal, vertical, down-right diagonal, and down-left diagonal checks, respectively.
2.  It starts iterating through the board from the top-left corner.
    *   `row = 0`, `col = 0`.
3.  The cell at `board[0][0]` is `'O'`, which is not a space (`' '`). The condition `self.board[row][col] != ' '` is true.
4.  The code now iterates through the `directions` to check for a line of five starting from `(0, 0)`.
    *   **First direction:** `(0, 1)` (horizontal).
    *   The method calls `_check_five_in_a_row(row=0, col=0, direction=(0, 1))`.
5.  **Inside `_check_five_in_a_row(0, 0, (0, 1))`:**
    *   `dx` is 0, `dy` is 1.
    *   `count` is initialized to 1.
    *   `symbol` is `self.board[0][0]`, which is `'O'`.
    *   The `for` loop starts, checking the next 4 cells in the horizontal direction.
        *   `i = 1`: `new_row = 0 + 0*1 = 0`, `new_col = 0 + 1*1 = 1`. `board[0][1]` is `'O'`, which matches `symbol`. `count` becomes 2.
        *   `i = 2`: `new_row = 0`, `new_col = 2`. `board[0][2]` is `'O'`, which matches `symbol`. `count` becomes 3.
        *   `i = 3`: `new_row = 0`, `new_col = 3`. `board[0][3]` is `'O'`, which matches `symbol`. `count` becomes 4.
        *   `i = 4`: `new_row = 0`, `new_col = 4`. `board[0][4]` is `'O'`, which matches `symbol`. `count` becomes 5.
    *   The loop finishes.
    *   The method returns the result of `count == 5`. Since `count` is 5, it returns `True`.
6.  **Back in `check_winner`:**
    *   The call to `_check_five_in_a_row` returned `True`.
    *   The `if` condition `if self._check_five_in_a_row(...)` is met.
    *   The method immediately executes `return self.board[row][col]`.
    *   `row` is 0 and `col` is 0. `self.board[0][0]` is `'O'`.
7.  The function returns `'O'`. The rest of the board, including the line of 'X's, is never checked because a winner has already been found.

**Conclusion:** The function will find the horizontal line of five 'O's in the first row and return 'O' as the winner.
