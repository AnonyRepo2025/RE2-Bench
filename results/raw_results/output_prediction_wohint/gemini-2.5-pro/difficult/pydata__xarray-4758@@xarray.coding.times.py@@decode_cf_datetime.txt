The user wants to predict the output of the `decode_cf_datetime` function.

**Function:** `decode_cf_datetime`
**Inputs:**
- `num_dates`: A numpy array represented as the string `"[12300 12301 12302 12303 12304]"`. This will be parsed as `np.array([12300, 12301, 12302, 12303, 12304])`.
- `units`: `"hour since 1680-01-01 00:00:00.500000"`
- `calendar`: `"standard"`
- `kwargs`: `{}` (so `use_cftime` is `None`)

**Step-by-step execution simulation:**

1.  **`decode_cf_datetime` is called.**
    *   `num_dates` is converted to a numpy array: `np.array([12300, 12301, 12302, 12303, 12304])`.
    *   `flat_num_dates` is a flattened version of this array.
    *   `calendar` is `"standard"`.
    *   `use_cftime` is `None`.
    *   The code enters the `try...except` block and attempts to call `_decode_datetime_with_pandas`.

2.  **`_decode_datetime_with_pandas` is called.**
    *   `flat_num_dates`: `np.array([12300, 12301, 12302, 12303, 12304])`
    *   `units`: `"hour since 1680-01-01 00:00:00.500000"`
    *   `calendar`: `"standard"`
    *   The check `calendar not in _STANDARD_CALENDARS` is `False`, as `"standard"` is in the set.
    *   `_unpack_netcdf_time_units(units)` is called.

3.  **`_unpack_netcdf_time_units` is called.**
    *   The regex `(.+) since (.+)` is applied to the `units` string.
    *   It successfully matches and extracts two groups.
    *   `delta_units` becomes `"hour"`.
    *   `ref_date` becomes `"1680-01-01 00:00:00.500000"`.
    *   `_ensure_padded_year` is called with this `ref_date`. Since the year "1680" is already 4 digits, it returns the string unchanged.
    *   The function returns `("hour", "1680-01-01 00:00:00.500000")`.

4.  **Back in `_decode_datetime_with_pandas`:**
    *   `delta` is `"hour"`, and `ref_date` is `"1680-01-01 00:00:00.500000"`.
    *   `_netcdf_to_numpy_timeunit(delta)` is called. It converts `"hour"` to `"hours"` and returns the corresponding numpy time unit code, which is `'h'`.
    *   `delta` is now `'h'`.
    *   `ref_date` is converted to a pandas Timestamp: `pd.Timestamp("1680-01-01 00:00:00.500000")`. This is a valid date within pandas' standard range, so it succeeds.
    *   The `flat_num_dates` array (dtype is integer) is multiplied by the number of nanoseconds in an hour (`_NS_PER_TIME_DELTA['h']`, which is `3_600_000_000_000`).
    *   The resulting integer array of nanoseconds is converted to a `TimedeltaIndex` using `pd.to_timedelta(..., 'ns')`.
    *   This `TimedeltaIndex` is added to the `ref_date` `Timestamp`.
        *   Let's calculate the first value: `12300` hours after `1680-01-01 00:00:00.500000`.
        *   `12300` hours is `512.5` days.
        *   `1680-01-01` + `512` days = `1681-05-26`.
        *   The time part is `0.5` days (`12` hours) + the original time `00:00:00.500000`.
        *   This results in `1681-05-26 12:00:00.500000`.
    *   The calculated dates (`1681-05-26`...) are well within the valid `numpy.datetime64` range (which is roughly years 1678 to 2262). Therefore, no `OutOfBoundsDatetime` or `OverflowError` is raised.
    *   The function successfully returns a numpy array of `datetime64[ns]` objects.

5.  **Back in `decode_cf_datetime`:**
    *   The `try` block completed successfully. The `except` block (which would use `cftime`) is skipped.
    *   The resulting array `dates` is reshaped to the original `num_dates.shape` (which is a 1D array, so no change).
    *   The function returns this numpy array.

**Predicted Output:**
The output will be a numpy array containing five `datetime64[ns]` values, starting from `1681-05-26T12:00:00.500000000` and increasing by one hour for each subsequent element. The JSON representation will reflect this array.
- `1680-01-01 00:00:00.5 + 12300 hours` -> `1681-05-26 12:00:00.5`
- `1680-01-01 00:00:00.5 + 12301 hours` -> `1681-05-26 13:00:00.5`
- `1680-01-01 00:00:00.5 + 12302 hours` -> `1681-05-26 14:00:00.5`
- `1680-01-01 00:00:00.5 + 12303 hours` -> `1681-05-26 15:00:00.5`
- `1680-01-01 00:00:00.5 + 12304 hours` -> `1681-05-26 16:00:00.5`
