[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `_setup` method of the `Nominal` class.

**1. Analyze the inputs:**
- `self`: An instance of the `Nominal` scale class. Its initial state has `order=None`, `_tick_params=None`, `_label_params=None`, and `_legend=None`.
- `data`: A `pandas.Series` object. The JSON representation `{"_mgr": {"blocks": [{}]}}` suggests it's an empty series. Its name is `"x"`.
- `prop`: A `Property` object. Its `variable` is `"objectproperty"`. We can infer from the code `if prop.legend:` that this property will have a legend.
- `kwargs`: Empty, so `axis` is `None`.

**2. Step-by-step execution of `_setup`:**

1.  `new = copy(self)`: A shallow copy of the `self` object is created. `new` has the same initial attributes as `self`.

2.  `if new._tick_params is None: new = new.tick()`: `new._tick_params` is `None`, so `new.tick()` is called. This method is not provided, but it's a common pattern in this kind of fluent interface (like in Seaborn or Altair) that it returns a new copy of the object with the `_tick_params` attribute initialized. Assuming it's called with no arguments, it will likely set `_tick_params` to a default object, which we can represent as an empty dictionary `{}`.

3.  `if new._label_params is None: new = new.label()`: Similarly, `new.label()` is called, and `_label_params` is initialized. We'll represent it as `{}`.

4.  `stringify = np.vectorize(format, otypes=['object'])`: A helper function is created to convert array elements to strings.

5.  `units_seed = categorical_order(data, new.order)`:
    - `data` is an empty Series.
    - `new.order` is `None`.
    - `categorical_order` on an empty series returns an empty list or an empty numpy array. Let's assume it's an empty list `[]`.
    - So, `units_seed` becomes `[]`.

6.  `class CatScale(...)`: A local class `CatScale` is defined.

7.  `mpl_scale = CatScale(data.name)`: An instance of `CatScale` is created. `data.name` is `"x"`. Although `matplotlib.scale.LinearScale`'s `__init__` expects an `axis` object, the local `CatScale` likely has a custom `__init__` that accepts the name string, as it's immediately used to create an instance. The resulting `mpl_scale` object will have an attribute representing this name.

8.  `if axis is None:`: The condition is true.
    - `axis = PseudoAxis(mpl_scale)`: A pseudo-axis object is created.
    - `axis.set_view_interval(0, len(units_seed) - 1)`: `len(units_seed)` is 0. This calls `axis.set_view_interval(0, -1)`, which sets an empty interval.

9.  `new._matplotlib_scale = mpl_scale`: The `new` object gets a `_matplotlib_scale` attribute, which is the `CatScale("x")` instance.

10. `axis.update_units(stringify(np.array(units_seed)))`: This is called with an empty array, effectively doing nothing.

11. `def convert_units(x): ...`: A function `convert_units` is defined. It will be part of the transformation pipeline. Since `units_seed` is empty, this function will map any input to `np.nan`.

12. `new._pipeline = [convert_units, prop.get_mapping(new, data)]`: The `_pipeline` attribute is set to a list of two functions. This attribute is not serializable to JSON.

13. `def spacer(x): ...`: A `spacer` function is defined.

14. `new._spacer = spacer`: The `_spacer` attribute is set to the `spacer` function. This is also not serializable.

15. `if prop.legend:`: We assume this is true for a data-mapped property.
    - `new._legend = (units_seed, list(stringify(np.array(units_seed))))`:
    - `units_seed` is `[]`.
    - `np.array(units_seed)` is `array([])`.
    - `stringify(...)` on an empty array is an empty array.
    - `list(...)` of an empty array is `[]`.
    - So, `new._legend` is set to the tuple `([], [])`.

16. `return new`: The method returns the modified `new` object.

**3. Construct the output:**

The output is the JSON representation of the returned `new` object. We will include all serializable attributes that have been set.

- `values`: `null` (from the original `self`)
- `order`: `null` (from the original `self`)
- `_tick_params`: `{}` (set by `tick()`)
- `_label_params`: `{}` (set by `label()`)
- `_legend`: `[[], []]` (a JSON array representing the tuple `([], [])`)
- `_matplotlib_scale`: An object representing the `CatScale` instance. We'll show its most relevant attribute, `name`, which was set to `"x"`. So, `{"name": "x"}`.
- The `_pipeline` and `_spacer` attributes hold functions and are not serializable, so they are omitted from the JSON output.

Combining these gives the final predicted output.
