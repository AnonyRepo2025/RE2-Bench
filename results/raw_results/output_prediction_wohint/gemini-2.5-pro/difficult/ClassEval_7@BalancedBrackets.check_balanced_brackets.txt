[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `check_balanced_brackets` method on a given `BalancedBrackets` object instance.

**State of the object before the method call:**
- `self.stack` = `["["]`
- `self.left_brackets` = `['(', '{', '[']`
- `self.right_brackets` = `[')', '}', ']']`
- `self.expr` = `"[(){}"`

**Simulating `check_balanced_brackets()` execution:**

1.  **`self.clear_expr()` is called.**
    -   The method iterates through `self.expr` (`"[(){}"`).
    -   It filters the string, keeping only characters that are in `self.left_brackets` or `self.right_brackets`.
    -   All characters in `"[(){}"` are brackets.
    -   So, `self.expr` remains unchanged: `"[(){}"`.

2.  **The `for` loop starts, iterating over the characters of `self.expr` (`"[(){}"`).**
    -   The initial state of `self.stack` is `["["]`.

3.  **`Brkt` = `[` (the first character of `expr`):**
    -   `'['` is in `self.left_brackets`.
    -   `self.stack.append('[')`.
    -   `self.stack` is now `['[', '[']`.

4.  **`Brkt` = `(`:**
    -   `'('` is in `self.left_brackets`.
    -   `self.stack.append('(')`.
    -   `self.stack` is now `['[', '[', '(']`.

5.  **`Brkt` = `)`:**
    -   `')'` is not in `self.left_brackets`, so the `else` block is executed.
    -   `Current_Brkt = self.stack.pop()`. This pops `'('` from the stack.
    -   `self.stack` is now `['[', '[']`.
    -   `Current_Brkt` is `'('`.
    -   The condition `if Current_Brkt == '(':` is true.
    -   The nested condition `if Brkt != ')'` (`')' != ')'`) is false.
    -   Execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.

6.  **`Brkt` = `{`:**
    -   `'{'` is in `self.left_brackets`.
    -   `self.stack.append('{')`.
    -   `self.stack` is now `['[', '[', '{']`.

7.  **`Brkt` = `}`:**
    -   `'}'` is not in `self.left_brackets`, so the `else` block is executed.
    -   `Current_Brkt = self.stack.pop()`. This pops `'{'` from the stack.
    -   `self.stack` is now `['[', '[']`.
    -   `Current_Brkt` is `'{'`.
    -   The condition `if Current_Brkt == '{':` is true.
    -   The nested condition `if Brkt != '}'` (`'}' != '}'`) is false.
    -   Execution continues.

8.  **The `for` loop finishes** as all characters in `self.expr` have been processed.

9.  **The final check `if self.stack:` is performed.**
    -   `self.stack` is `['[', '[']`.
    -   An empty list evaluates to `False` in a boolean context, but a non-empty list evaluates to `True`.
    -   Since the stack is not empty, the condition is `True`.
    -   The code inside the `if` block is executed: `return False`.

10. **The function returns `False`.** The reason is that the stack was not empty at the end of the process, indicating an imbalance (two unclosed left brackets).
