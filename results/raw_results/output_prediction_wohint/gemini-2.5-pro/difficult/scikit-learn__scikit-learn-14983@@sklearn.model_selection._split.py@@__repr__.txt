*   **Step 1: Analyze the `__repr__` method.**
    The `__repr__` method of the `BaseCrossValidator` class is defined as:
    ```python
    def __repr__(self):
        return _build_repr(self)
    ```
    This method simply calls a helper function `_build_repr` and passes the current object instance (`self`) to it.

*   **Step 2: Infer the behavior of `_build_repr`.**
    The code for `_build_repr` is not provided. However, its name and usage within a `__repr__` method strongly suggest its purpose is to build a string representation of the object. In Python, a common convention for `__repr__` is to return a string that looks like a constructor call, showing the class name and its important attributes. For example, `ClassName(param1=value1, param2=value2)`. The function likely inspects the public attributes of the `self` object and formats them into such a string.

*   **Step 3: Examine the input `self` object.**
    The input `self` object is an instance of `BaseCrossValidator` and has the following attributes:
    *   `test_fold`: The string `'[1 1 2 2]'`
    *   `unique_folds`: The string `'[1 2]'`

*   **Step 4: Simulate the `_build_repr` function.**
    `_build_repr` will likely perform the following actions:
    1.  Get the class name of the object: `BaseCrossValidator`.
    2.  Get the public attributes and their values. In this case, `test_fold` and `unique_folds`.
    3.  Format these into a `key=value` string. Since the values are already strings, they will be enclosed in quotes in the final representation (e.g., `test_fold='[1 1 2 2]'`).
    4.  Combine these parts into the final string: `BaseCrossValidator(test_fold='[1 1 2 2]', unique_folds='[1 2]')`. The order of attributes is typically alphabetical for consistency.

*   **Step 5: Construct the final output.**
    The `__repr__` method returns the string generated in the previous step. The final output should be a JSON object containing this string.

```json
{
    "repr": "BaseCrossValidator(test_fold='[1 1 2 2]', unique_folds='[1 2]')"
}
```
