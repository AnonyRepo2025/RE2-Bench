*   **Function:** `confusion_matrix`
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `y_true`: A NumPy array of true labels.
    *   `y_pred`: A NumPy array of predicted labels.
    *   `labels`: `None`.
    *   `sample_weight`: `None`.
    *   `normalize`: `None` (default).

**Step-by-step execution:**

1.  **Input Parsing:** The input strings for `y_true` and `y_pred` are parsed into NumPy arrays.
    *   `y_true` has 104 elements: 40 `0`s (indices 0-39), 60 `1`s (indices 40-99), and 4 `2`s (indices 100-103).
    *   `y_pred` has 104 elements: 30 `0`s (at indices 0-19 and 40-49), 70 `1`s (at indices 20-39 and 50-99), and 4 `2`s (at indices 100-103).

2.  **`_check_targets(y_true, y_pred)`:**
    *   `check_consistent_length` is called. Both arrays have length 104, so this passes.
    *   `type_of_target` is called for both `y_true` and `y_pred`. Since both contain more than two unique integer values (0, 1, 2), the type for both is determined to be `'multiclass'`.
    *   The function returns `y_type = 'multiclass'`, along with the original `y_true` and `y_pred` arrays.

3.  **Label Determination:**
    *   The `if labels is None:` block is executed.
    *   `labels = unique_labels(y_true, y_pred)` is called. This function finds all unique values across both input arrays and sorts them. The unique values are {0, 1, 2}.
    *   `labels` is set to `np.array([0, 1, 2])`.

4.  **Sample Weight Initialization:**
    *   The `if sample_weight is None:` block is executed.
    *   `sample_weight` is initialized to an array of ones with the same length as `y_true` (104).

5.  **Confusion Matrix Calculation:**
    *   `n_labels` is set to `labels.size`, which is 3.
    *   A mapping `label_to_ind` is created: `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}`.
    *   The values in `y_true` and `y_pred` are already consistent with this mapping, so they remain unchanged.
    *   The core of the calculation is `cm = coo_matrix((sample_weight, (y_true, y_pred)), shape=(3, 3), ...).toarray()`. This creates a 3x3 matrix where each element `cm[i, j]` is the sum of weights for samples where the true label was `i` and the predicted label was `j`. Since all weights are 1, this is equivalent to counting the occurrences of each `(true, predicted)` pair.

6.  **Counting the pairs:**
    *   **`cm[0, 0]` (True=0, Pred=0):** `y_true` is 0 at indices 0-39. `y_pred` is 0 at indices 0-19. The overlap is at indices 0-19. Count = 20.
    *   **`cm[0, 1]` (True=0, Pred=1):** `y_true` is 0 at indices 0-39. `y_pred` is 1 at indices 20-39. The overlap is at indices 20-39. Count = 20.
    *   **`cm[0, 2]` (True=0, Pred=2):** `y_true` is 0 at indices 0-39. `y_pred` is 2 at indices 100-103. No overlap. Count = 0.
    *   **`cm[1, 0]` (True=1, Pred=0):** `y_true` is 1 at indices 40-99. `y_pred` is 0 at indices 40-49. The overlap is at indices 40-49. Count = 10.
    *   **`cm[1, 1]` (True=1, Pred=1):** `y_true` is 1 at indices 40-99. `y_pred` is 1 at indices 50-99. The overlap is at indices 50-99. Count = 50.
    *   **`cm[1, 2]` (True=1, Pred=2):** `y_true` is 1 at indices 40-99. `y_pred` is 2 at indices 100-103. No overlap. Count = 0.
    *   **`cm[2, 0]` (True=2, Pred=0):** `y_true` is 2 at indices 100-103. `y_pred` is 0. No overlap. Count = 0.
    *   **`cm[2, 1]` (True=2, Pred=1):** `y_true` is 2 at indices 100-103. `y_pred` is 1. No overlap. Count = 0.
    *   **`cm[2, 2]` (True=2, Pred=2):** `y_true` is 2 at indices 100-103. `y_pred` is 2 at indices 100-103. The overlap is at indices 100-103. Count = 4.

7.  **Final Matrix:** The resulting confusion matrix `cm` is:
    ```
    [[20, 20,  0],
     [10, 50,  0],
     [ 0,  0,  4]]
    ```

8.  **Normalization:** The `normalize` argument is `None`, so no normalization is applied. The `np.nan_to_num` call has no effect as there are no NaNs.

9.  **Return Value:** The function returns the final `cm` NumPy array.
