*   **Function:** `periodicity`
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `f`: `"csc(2*x) - sec(x)"`
    *   `symbol`: `'x'` (inferred as the only free symbol in the expression)
    *   `check`: `False` (default)

### Step-by-step execution simulation:

1.  The `periodicity` function is called with `f = "csc(2*x) - sec(x)"`.
2.  `orig_f` is set to the input `f`.
3.  `f = simplify(orig_f)`:
    *   The string `"csc(2*x) - sec(x)"` is first converted to a SymPy expression object using `sympify`. The expression is `csc(2*x) - sec(x)`.
    *   `simplify` is called on this expression. `simplify` attempts various transformations (`trigsimp`, `together`, etc.) to find a "simpler" form. The expression might be converted to a common denominator form like `(1 - 2*sin(x))/(2*sin(x)*cos(x))` or it might remain as `csc(2*x) - sec(x)`. For this analysis, we'll assume it remains `csc(2*x) - sec(x)`, as the logic for finding the period works on either form and yields the same result.
4.  `period` is initialized to `None`.
5.  The code checks the type of the expression `f`. It is not a `Relational`, `TrigonometricFunction`, `Abs`, `Pow`, or `Mul` at its top level.
6.  The condition `elif f.is_Add:` is met, as the expression is a sum (specifically, `csc(2*x) + (-1)*sec(x)`).
7.  `k, g = f.as_independent(symbol)` is called. This separates terms that are constant with respect to `x` from those that are not.
    *   `k` (the constant part) is `0`.
    *   `g` (the variable part) is `csc(2*x) - sec(x)`.
8.  Since `k` is `0`, the `if k is not S.Zero:` block is skipped.
9.  `period = _periodicity(g.args, symbol)` is executed. `_periodicity` is an internal helper function that computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of the functions in the sequence `g.args`.
    *   `g.args` is the tuple `(csc(2*x), -sec(x))`.
    *   `_periodicity` will recursively call `periodicity` for each term in the tuple.
10. **First recursive call:** `periodicity(csc(2*x), 'x')`
    *   The expression is a `TrigonometricFunction`.
    *   The code calls `csc(2*x).period('x')`.
    *   The period of `csc(a*x)` is `2*pi / |a|`. Here, `a=2`, so the period is `2*pi / 2 = pi`.
    *   This call returns `pi`.
11. **Second recursive call:** `periodicity(-sec(x), 'x')`
    *   The expression is a `Mul` (`-1 * sec(x)`).
    *   The `elif f.is_Mul:` block is executed.
    *   `coeff, g = f.as_independent(symbol, as_Add=False)` separates the constant coefficient. `coeff` is `-1` and `g` is `sec(x)`.
    *   The function then calls `periodicity(g, symbol)`, which is `periodicity(sec(x), 'x')`.
    *   This inner call finds that `sec(x)` is a `TrigonometricFunction` and its period is `2*pi`.
    *   The call `periodicity(-sec(x), 'x')` returns `2*pi`.
12. Back in the `_periodicity` helper, it now has the individual periods: `pi` and `2*pi`.
13. It computes the least common multiple of these periods using `lcm_list([pi, 2*pi])`.
14. `lcm(pi, 2*pi)` is `2*pi`.
15. The `_periodicity` function returns `2*pi`, which is assigned to the `period` variable in the main function call.
16. The condition `if period is not None:` is true.
17. The condition `if check:` is false because `check` was not provided and defaults to `False`.
18. The function returns the value of `period`, which is the SymPy object `2*pi`.
