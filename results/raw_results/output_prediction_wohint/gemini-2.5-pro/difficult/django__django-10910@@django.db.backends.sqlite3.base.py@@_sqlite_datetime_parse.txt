[THOUGHT]
1.  **Function Entry:** The function `_sqlite_datetime_parse` is called with `dt="2016-06-13 00:00:00"`, `tzname="UTC"`, and `conn_tzname="UTC"`.

2.  **Initial Checks:**
    *   `dt` is not `None`, so the execution continues.
    *   The code enters a `try` block.

3.  **Call `backend_utils.typecast_timestamp`:**
    *   `typecast_timestamp` is called with `s="2016-06-13 00:00:00"`.
    *   Inside `typecast_timestamp`:
        *   `s` is not empty.
        *   `' ' in s` is true.
        *   `d, t = s.split()` results in `d = "2016-06-13"` and `t = "00:00:00"`.
        *   The timezone offset checks (`'-' in t` and `'+' in t`) are false.
        *   `dates = d.split('-')` results in `dates = ['2016', '06', '13']`.
        *   `times = t.split(':')` results in `times = ['00', '00', '00']`.
        *   `seconds = times[2]` results in `seconds = "00"`.
        *   `'.' in seconds` is false, so `microseconds = '0'`.
        *   Assuming `settings.USE_TZ` is `True` (standard for modern Django), `tzinfo` is set to `utc`.
        *   A `datetime.datetime` object is constructed: `datetime.datetime(int('2016'), int('06'), int('13'), int('00'), int('00'), int('00'), int('000000'), tzinfo=utc)`.
        *   This creates `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc)`.
    *   `typecast_timestamp` returns this `datetime` object.

4.  **Back in `_sqlite_datetime_parse`:**
    *   The returned `datetime` object is assigned back to the `dt` variable.
    *   The `except` block is skipped as no error occurred.
    *   The condition `if conn_tzname:` is true because `conn_tzname` is "UTC".
    *   `dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.timezone(conn_tzname))` is executed.
        *   `pytz.timezone("UTC")` returns the `pytz.utc` object.
        *   `dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.utc)` is called on `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc)`. This replaces the timezone with the same timezone, so the `dt` object remains unchanged.
    *   The next condition is `if tzname is not None and tzname != conn_tzname:`.
        *   `tzname` is "UTC" and `conn_tzname` is "UTC".
        *   `tzname != conn_tzname` is `False`.
    *   The body of this `if` statement is skipped.

5.  **Return Value:**
    *   The function returns the final `dt` object, which is `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc)`.

6.  **Final Output Formatting:** The `datetime` object is serialized into the specified JSON format.
    *   `$__class__`: "datetime"
    *   `year`: 2016
    *   `month`: 6
    *   `day`: 13
    *   `hour`: 0
    *   `minute`: 0
    *   `second`: 0
    *   `microsecond`: 0
    *   `tzinfo`: "UTC" (representing `pytz.utc`)
