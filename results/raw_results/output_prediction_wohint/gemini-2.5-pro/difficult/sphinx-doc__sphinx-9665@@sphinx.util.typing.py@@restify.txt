`restify` with `cls` as `None`.

1.  The function `restify` is called with `cls = None`.
2.  The `try` block is entered.
3.  The first `if` condition is `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`.
4.  Since `cls` is `None`, the condition `cls is None` evaluates to `True`.
5.  The code inside this `if` block is executed.
6.  The function returns the string `':py:obj:`None`'`.
7.  The execution stops here.

The final returned value is `':py:obj:`None`'`.
