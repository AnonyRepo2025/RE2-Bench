*   **Function:** `orthogonal_mp_gram`
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `Gram`: A 12x12 numpy array representing the Gram matrix (inner products of dictionary atoms).
    *   `Xy`: A 12x1 numpy array representing the inner products of the dictionary atoms with the signal.
    *   `n_nonzero_coefs`: 1
    *   `tol`: `None`
    *   `norms_squared`: A list `[4.64744652]`. This is unused because `tol` is `None`.
    *   `copy_Gram`: `True` (default).
    *   `copy_Xy`: `False`.
    *   `return_path`: `False` (default).
    *   `return_n_iter`: `False` (default).

### Step-by-step execution:

1.  **`orthogonal_mp_gram` starts:**
    *   `Gram` is validated and copied by `check_array` because `copy_Gram` is `True`.
    *   `Xy` is a 12x1 numpy array. `Xy.ndim` is 2, `Xy.shape[1]` is 1. The `if Xy.ndim == 1:` block is skipped.
    *   `copy_Xy` is `False`, so `Xy` is not copied.
    *   `n_nonzero_coefs` is 1, and `tol` is `None`. The initial checks for these parameters pass.
    *   `return_path` is `False`, so the `else` block is taken:
        *   `coef = np.zeros((len(Gram), Xy.shape[1]))` creates a 12x1 array of zeros. `coef` is `[[0.], [0.], ..., [0.]]`.
    *   `n_iters` is initialized to `[]`.
    *   A `for` loop starts to iterate over the columns of `Xy`. Since `Xy.shape[1]` is 1, the loop runs once with `k = 0`.

2.  **Inside the `for` loop (k=0):**
    *   The function `_gram_omp` is called with the following key arguments:
        *   `Gram`: The 12x12 Gram matrix.
        *   `Xy`: The first (and only) column of the input `Xy`, which is a 1D array of shape (12,).
        *   `n_nonzero_coefs`: 1.
        *   `tol`: `None`.
        *   `return_path`: `False`.

3.  **`_gram_omp` execution:**
    *   This function implements the core Orthogonal Matching Pursuit logic.
    *   `max_features` is set to `n_nonzero_coefs`, which is 1.
    *   The initial residual `alpha` is set to the input `Xy` vector: `[ 0.126..., -0.446..., ..., -0.094...]`.
    *   The `while True:` loop begins. It will run until `n_active == max_features`.
    *   **Loop Iteration 1:**
        *   `lam = np.argmax(np.abs(alpha))`: This finds the index of the element with the largest absolute value in `alpha`.
            *   `np.abs(alpha)` is `[0.126..., 0.446..., 0.293..., 0.841..., 2.155..., ...]`.
            *   The maximum value is `2.15579371` at index 4.
            *   `lam` is set to `4`.
        *   The code selects this atom (index 4) and performs calculations.
        *   `n_active` is incremented to 1.
        *   `gamma, _ = potrs(...)`: This solves for the coefficient of the selected atom. Since it's the first and only atom, the system to solve is simple. `Gram[4, 4]` is 1.0, so `L[0,0]` becomes `sqrt(1.0) = 1.0`. The system is `1.0 * gamma = Xy[4]`, so `gamma` becomes `[2.15579371]`.
        *   The `elif n_active == max_features:` condition is checked. `1 == 1` is true, so the loop breaks.
    *   `_gram_omp` returns `(gamma, indices[:n_active], n_active)`.
        *   `gamma`: `[2.15579371]`
        *   `indices[:n_active]`: `[4]` (the index of the selected atom).
        *   `n_active`: `1`.
    *   The return value is `([2.15579371], [4], 1)`.

4.  **Back in `orthogonal_mp_gram`:**
    *   The returned tuple is unpacked: `x, idx, n_iter = ([2.15579371], [4], 1)`.
    *   `return_path` is `False`, so the `else` block is executed.
    *   `coef[idx, k] = x`: This updates the `coef` array.
        *   `coef[[4], 0] = [2.15579371]`.
        *   The `coef` array, initially all zeros, now has `2.15579371` at index 4.
        *   `coef` is `[[0.], [0.], [0.], [0.], [2.15579371], [0.], [0.], [0.], [0.], [0.], [0.], [0.]]`.
    *   `n_iters.append(n_iter)`: `n_iters` becomes `[1]`.

5.  **After the loop:**
    *   `if Xy.shape[1] == 1:` is true, so `n_iters` is set to `n_iters[0]`, which is `1`.
    *   `if return_n_iter:` is false.
    *   The final `else` block is executed: `return np.squeeze(coef)`.
    *   `np.squeeze` converts the 12x1 `coef` array into a 1D array of shape (12,).

### Predicted output

The function will return a 1D numpy array of length 12, containing zeros everywhere except at index 4, where the value will be the coefficient of the most correlated atom.
