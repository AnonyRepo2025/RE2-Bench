[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `_mapping_repr` function.

**Function Signature:**
`_mapping_repr(mapping, title, summarizer, expand_option_name, col_width=None, max_rows=None)`

**Inputs:**
- `mapping`: `{"foo": "bar"}`
- `title`: `"Attributes"`
- `summarizer`: A function object, represented as `{}` in the JSON input.
- `expand_option_name`: `"display_expand_attrs"`
- `col_width`: `None` (default)
- `max_rows`: `None` (default)

**Step-by-step execution simulation:**

1.  The function `_mapping_repr` is called.
2.  `col_width` is `None`. The code enters the `if col_width is None:` block.
3.  `_calculate_col_width(mapping)` is called.
    -   `col_items` is `mapping`, which is `{'foo': 'bar'}`.
    -   The generator `(len(str(s)) for s in col_items)` iterates over the keys of the mapping. The only key is `'foo'`.
    -   `max_name_length` becomes `max([len('foo')])`, which is `3`.
    -   `col_width` is calculated as `max(max_name_length, 7) + 6` -> `max(3, 7) + 6` -> `7 + 6` -> `13`.
    -   `_calculate_col_width` returns `13`.
4.  Back in `_mapping_repr`, `col_width` is now `13`.
5.  `max_rows` is `None`. The code enters the `if max_rows is None:` block.
6.  `max_rows` is set to `OPTIONS['display_max_rows']`. The default value for this is `12`, which is greater than the number of items in our mapping.
7.  `summary` is initialized as a list containing the title: `summary = ['Attributes:']`.
8.  The code checks `if mapping:`. The mapping `{"foo": "bar"}` is not empty, so this is true.
9.  `len_mapping` is calculated as `len(mapping)`, which is `1`.
10. The code checks `if not _get_boolean_with_default(expand_option_name, default=True):`.
    -   `_get_boolean_with_default` is called with `option="display_expand_attrs"`.
    -   Assuming the default xarray options, `OPTIONS['display_expand_attrs']` is `'default'`.
    -   The function returns the `default` value, which is `True`.
    -   The condition becomes `if not True:`, which is false. This block is skipped.
11. The code checks `elif len_mapping > max_rows:`.
    -   This is `1 > 12`, which is false. This block is skipped.
12. The `else:` block is executed.
13. The code executes `summary += [summarizer(k, v, col_width) for k, v in mapping.items()]`.
    -   This will loop once for the item `('foo', 'bar')`.
    -   It calls `summarizer('foo', 'bar', 13)`.
    -   The `summarizer` function is not defined in the provided snippets. It's a function passed as an argument. For representing attributes, a simple and reasonable implementation would format the key-value pair with indentation. Let's assume the simplest behavior: `lambda k, v, w: f"    {k}: {v}"`.
    -   The call `summarizer('foo', 'bar', 13)` would return `"    foo: bar"`.
    -   The list comprehension evaluates to `['    foo: bar']`.
14. `summary` is updated by adding this list: `summary` is now `['Attributes:', '    foo: bar']`.
15. The function returns `'\n'.join(summary)`.
16. The final result is the string `"Attributes:\n    foo: bar"`.
