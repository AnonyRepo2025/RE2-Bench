[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `format_string` method of the `NumberWordFormatter` class.

**Input:**
- `self`: An instance of `NumberWordFormatter` with its default attributes.
- `x`: The string "1000000".

**Step-by-step execution of `format_string(x="1000000")`:**

1.  **Splitting the number:**
    *   `x` is "1000000".
    *   `x.split('.')` results in `['1000000']`.
    *   `['1000000'] + ['']` becomes `['1000000', '']`.
    *   `[:2]` takes the first two elements.
    *   `lstr` is assigned `"1000000"`.
    *   `rstr` is assigned `""`.

2.  **Processing the integer part (`lstr`):**
    *   `lstrrev = lstr[::-1]` reverses "1000000" to "0000001".
    *   `a` is initialized to `['', '', '', '', '']`.
    *   `len(lstrrev)` is 7. `7 % 3` is 1. The condition `len(lstrrev) % 3 == 1` is true.
    *   `lstrrev += '00'`: `lstrrev` becomes "000000100". Its length is now 9, which is divisible by 3.
    *   `lm` is initialized to `''`.

3.  **Looping through 3-digit chunks:**
    *   The loop runs for `i` in `range(len(lstrrev) // 3)`, which is `range(3)`, so `i` will be 0, 1, 2.

    *   **`i = 0` (the first group of three from the right, representing units/tens/hundreds):**
        *   `a[0] = lstrrev[0:3][::-1]` -> `lstrrev[0:3]` is "000". Reversed is "000". `a[0]` is "000".
        *   The condition `a[0] != '000'` is false.
        *   The `else` block is executed: `lm += self.trans_three('000')`.
        *   `trans_three('000')` calls `trans_two('00')`, which returns `self.NUMBER[0]`, which is `''`.
        *   `lm` remains `''`.

    *   **`i = 1` (the second group, representing thousands):**
        *   `a[1] = lstrrev[3:6][::-1]` -> `lstrrev[3:6]` is "000". Reversed is "000". `a[1]` is "000".
        *   The condition `a[1] != '000'` is false.
        *   The `else` block is executed: `lm += self.trans_three('000')`.
        *   This again returns `''`.
        *   `lm` remains `''`.

    *   **`i = 2` (the third group, representing millions):**
        *   `a[2] = lstrrev[6:9][::-1]` -> `lstrrev[6:9]` is "100". Reversed is "001". `a[2]` is "001".
        *   The condition `a[2] != '000'` is true.
        *   The `if` block is executed: `lm = self.trans_three(a[2]) + ' ' + self.parse_more(2) + ' ' + lm`.
        *   `self.trans_three('001')`:
            *   Calls `self.trans_two('01')`.
            *   `trans_two('01')` returns `self.NUMBER[int('1')]`, which is `'ONE'`.
        *   `self.parse_more(2)`:
            *   Returns `self.NUMBER_MORE[2]`, which is `'MILLION'`.
        *   The current value of `lm` is `''`.
        *   The assignment becomes: `lm = 'ONE' + ' ' + 'MILLION' + ' ' + ''`.
        *   `lm` is now `'ONE MILLION '`.

4.  **Processing the decimal part (`rstr`):**
    *   `rstr` is `""`, which is a falsy value.
    *   The `if rstr` condition is false.
    *   `xs` is assigned `''`.

5.  **Final formatting:**
    *   `lm.strip()` is `'ONE MILLION'`, which is a truthy value.
    *   The `if not lm.strip()` condition is false.
    *   The `else` block is executed.
    *   It returns `f'{lm.strip()} {xs}ONLY'`.
    *   Substituting the values: `f'{"ONE MILLION"} {""}ONLY'`.
    *   This evaluates to `'ONE MILLION ONLY'`.

**Conclusion:** The function will return the string "ONE MILLION ONLY".
