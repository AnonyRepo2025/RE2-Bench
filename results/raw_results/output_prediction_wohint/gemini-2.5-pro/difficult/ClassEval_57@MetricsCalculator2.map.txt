[THOUGHT]
1.  The user wants to predict the output of the `map` static method from the `MetricsCalculator2` class.
2.  The input `data` is an empty list `[]`.
3.  The `map` method is called with `data = []`.
4.  The first `if` statement checks the type of `data`: `if type(data) != list and type(data) != tuple:`.
5.  `type(data)` is `list`, so `type(data) != list` is `False`. The condition is not met, and the `Exception` is not raised.
6.  The next `if` statement checks the length of `data`: `if len(data) == 0:`.
7.  `len([])` is `0`. The condition `0 == 0` is `True`.
8.  The code inside this `if` block is executed: `return (0.0, [0.0])`.
9.  The function immediately returns the tuple `(0.0, [0.0])`.
10. The final output will be this tuple, represented in JSON format. A tuple is represented as an array in JSON.
