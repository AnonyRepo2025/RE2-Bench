[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `check_winner` method from the `BlackjackGame` class.

**1. Analyze the input:**
- `player_hand`: `["2S", "4S", "5S"]`
- `dealer_hand`: `["2S", "JS", "QS"]`

**2. Trace the `check_winner` method execution:**
- The method first calls `self.calculate_hand_value` for the `player_hand`.
- Let's calculate the player's score:
    - `hand` = `["2S", "4S", "5S"]`
    - `value` starts at 0. `num_aces` is 0.
    - For card "2S", rank is "2". `value` becomes 0 + 2 = 2.
    - For card "4S", rank is "4". `value` becomes 2 + 4 = 6.
    - For card "5S", rank is "5". `value` becomes 6 + 5 = 11.
    - The final `player_value` is 11.

- Next, the method calls `self.calculate_hand_value` for the `dealer_hand`.
- Let's calculate the dealer's score:
    - `hand` = `["2S", "JS", "QS"]`
    - `value` starts at 0. `num_aces` is 0.
    - For card "2S", rank is "2". `value` becomes 0 + 2 = 2.
    - For card "JS", rank is "J". `value` becomes 2 + 10 = 12.
    - For card "QS", rank is "Q". `value` becomes 12 + 10 = 22.
    - The final `dealer_value` is 22.

- Now, the `check_winner` method compares the scores:
    - `player_value` = 11
    - `dealer_value` = 22

- The `if/elif` conditions are evaluated:
    - `if player_value > 21 and dealer_value > 21:` -> `11 > 21` is false. Condition is false.
    - `elif player_value > 21:` -> `11 > 21` is false. Condition is false.
    - `elif dealer_value > 21:` -> `22 > 21` is true. This condition is met.
    - The code inside this `elif` block is executed, which is `return 'Player wins'`.

**3. Final Output:**
- The function will return the string 'Player wins'.
