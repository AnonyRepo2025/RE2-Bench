[THOUGHT]
1.  **Function Call:** The `write_excel` method of the `ExcelProcessor` class is called.
2.  **Inputs:**
    *   `self`: An instance of `ExcelProcessor`. The `__init__` method is empty, so there are no instance-specific attributes.
    *   `data`: A list of lists containing the data to be written. The data is `[["Name", "Age", "Country", "AGE"], ["John", 25, "USA", 25], ["Alice", 30, "Canada", 30], ["Bob", 35, "Australia", 35]]`.
    *   `file_name`: A string `"test_data_process.xlsx"`.
3.  **Execution Analysis:**
    *   The method enters the `try` block.
    *   `workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()`: A new `openpyxl` workbook object is created in memory. This is a standard operation and should succeed.
    *   `sheet = workbook.active`: The active worksheet (the first one by default) is assigned to the `sheet` variable. This should also succeed.
    *   `for row in data:`: The code begins to loop through the `data` list.
        *   For the first row `["Name", "Age", "Country", "AGE"]`, `sheet.append(row)` is called. This adds the header row to the worksheet.
        *   For the second row `["John", 25, "USA", 25]`, `sheet.append(row)` is called, adding the second row.
        *   For the third row `["Alice", 30, "Canada", 30]`, `sheet.append(row)` is called, adding the third row.
        *   For the fourth row `["Bob", 35, "Australia", 35]`, `sheet.append(row)` is called, adding the fourth row.
    *   The loop completes successfully.
    *   `workbook.save(file_name)`: The method attempts to save the workbook to a file named `"test_data_process.xlsx"`. Assuming the environment has write permissions to the current directory, this operation will succeed.
    *   `workbook.close()`: The workbook is closed. This will succeed.
    *   Since no exceptions were raised during the process, the `try` block completes.
    *   `return 1`: The function returns the integer `1`.
4.  **Final Output:** The `except` block is skipped, and the function returns `1`.
