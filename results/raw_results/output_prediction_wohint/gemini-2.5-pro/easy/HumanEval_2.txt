[THOUGHT]
1.  The user wants me to execute the Python function `truncate_number` with the given input.
2.  The function is defined as `def truncate_number(number: float) -> float: return number % 1.0`.
3.  The input provided is `number = 3.5`.
4.  The function will be called as `truncate_number(3.5)`.
5.  Inside the function, the expression `number % 1.0` is evaluated.
6.  This translates to `3.5 % 1.0`.
7.  The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division.
8.  When we divide `3.5` by `1.0`, the integer part of the division is `3`, and the remainder is `0.5`.
9.  Calculation: `3.5 = (1.0 * 3) + 0.5`. The remainder is `0.5`.
10. The function returns this remainder, which is `0.5`.
11. The name `truncate_number` is slightly misleading, as "truncating" usually means removing the decimal part (e.g., `int(3.5)` would be `3`). However, the implementation `number % 1.0` actually isolates and returns the fractional part of the number. I must follow the code's logic, not its name.
12. The final result is `0.5`.
