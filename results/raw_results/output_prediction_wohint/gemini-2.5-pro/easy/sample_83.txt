The user wants me to predict the output of the Python function `f` for the input `text = "qq0tt"`.

Let's trace the execution of the function step by step:

1.  **Function Call**: The function `f` is called with the argument `text = "qq0tt"`.

2.  **Line 1: `l = text.rpartition('0')`**
    *   The `rpartition()` method searches for the last occurrence of the separator `'0'` in the string `text`.
    *   It splits the string into a 3-element tuple: the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator.
    *   In the string `"qq0tt"`, the last (and only) occurrence of `'0'` is at index 2.
    *   The part before `'0'` is `"qq"`.
    *   The separator is `'0'`.
    *   The part after `'0'` is `"tt"`.
    *   Therefore, the variable `l` is assigned the tuple `('qq', '0', 'tt')`.

3.  **Line 2: `if l[2] == '':`**
    *   This line checks if the third element of the tuple `l` is an empty string.
    *   `l[2]` is `"tt"`.
    *   The condition `"tt" == ''` evaluates to `False`.
    *   So, the code block inside the `if` statement is skipped.

4.  **Line 4: `return f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find('0') + 1}'`**
    *   Since the `if` condition was false, this `return` statement is executed.
    *   It constructs a formatted string (f-string). Let's evaluate the expressions inside the curly braces:
        *   `len(l[0])`: `l[0]` is `"qq"`. `len("qq")` is `2`.
        *   `l[2].find('0') + 1`:
            *   `l[2]` is `"tt"`.
            *   `"tt".find('0')` searches for the character `'0'` within the string `"tt"`. Since `'0'` is not found, the `find()` method returns `-1`.
            *   The expression becomes `-1 + 1`, which evaluates to `0`.
    *   The f-string `f'{2}:{0}'` is then constructed, resulting in the string `"2:0"`.

5.  **Final Output**: The function returns the string `"2:0"`.
