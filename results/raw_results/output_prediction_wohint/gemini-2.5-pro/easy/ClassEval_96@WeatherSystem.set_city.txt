[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `set_city` method from the `WeatherSystem` class.

1.  **Analyze the initial state:** The `self` object is an instance of `WeatherSystem`. Its `city` attribute is initialized to "New York".
2.  **Analyze the method call:** The `set_city` method is called with the argument `city="Beijing"`.
3.  **Trace the method execution:**
    *   The method `set_city(self, city)` is invoked.
    *   Inside the method, the line `self.city = city` is executed.
    *   The value of the `city` parameter ("Beijing") is assigned to the instance attribute `self.city`.
    *   The `self.city` attribute is now updated from "New York" to "Beijing".
    *   The method reaches its end.
4.  **Determine the return value:** The `set_city` method does not have an explicit `return` statement. In Python, functions and methods that do not explicitly return a value implicitly return `None`.
5.  **Format the output:** The predicted output is `None`. In JSON format, `None` is represented as `null`. Therefore, the final output will be `{"output": null}`.
