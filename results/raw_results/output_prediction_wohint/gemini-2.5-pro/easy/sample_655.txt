Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with the input string `s = "rpaar"`.
2. The first operation is `s.replace('a', '')`. This replaces all occurrences of the character 'a' in the string "rpaar" with an empty string.
   - "rpaar" becomes "rpr".
3. The result of the first operation, "rpr", is then used for the next chained method call: `.replace('r', '')`. This replaces all occurrences of the character 'r' in the string "rpr" with an empty string.
   - "rpr" becomes "p".
4. The function returns the final string, which is "p".
