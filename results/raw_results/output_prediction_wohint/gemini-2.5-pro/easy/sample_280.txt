Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` step by step.

1.  **Function Definition:**
    *   A global variable `field` is initialized to `0`.
    *   The function `f` takes one argument, `text`.
    *   Inside `f`, it declares that it will modify the global variables `g` and `field`.

2.  **Function Call:**
    *   The function `f` is called with the input `text = "00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110"`.

3.  **Inside the function `f`:**
    *   `global g, field`: This statement indicates that the assignments to `g` and `field` within this function will affect the global variables with those names, not create new local ones.
    *   `field = text.replace(' ', '')`:
        *   The original `text` string is `"00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110"`.
        *   All space characters are removed from `text`.
        *   The global variable `field` is updated to `"0000000000000000011011000110010101101110"`.
    *   `g = text.replace('0', ' ')`:
        *   This operation is performed on the *original* `text` string passed as an argument, which is `"00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110"`.
        *   All '0' characters are replaced with spaces ' '.
        *   The global variable `g` is created and assigned the value `"         11 11   11  1 1  11 111 "`.
    *   `text = text.replace('1', 'i')`:
        *   This operation also uses the original `text` string: `"00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110"`.
        *   All '1' characters are replaced with 'i' characters.
        *   The *local* variable `text` is updated to `"00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0i 0ii0iiii"`. Note that this is an assignment to the local `text` variable, not a modification of the original string object.
    *   `return text`:
        *   The function returns the final value of the local `text` variable.

4.  **Final Output:**
    *   The value returned by the function is `"00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0i 0ii0iiii"`.
