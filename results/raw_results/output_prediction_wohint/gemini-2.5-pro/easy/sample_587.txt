Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with `nums = [0, 1, 1, 2]` and `fill = "abcca"`.
2. The core of the function is the line `ans = dict.fromkeys(nums, fill)`.
3. The `dict.fromkeys()` method creates a new dictionary. The first argument, `nums`, is an iterable that provides the keys for the new dictionary. The second argument, `fill`, is the value to be assigned to each of these keys.
4. The iterable `nums` is `[0, 1, 1, 2]`. When creating keys from an iterable, `dict.fromkeys()` automatically handles duplicates by only using the unique elements. The unique elements in `nums` are `0`, `1`, and `2`.
5. The value to be assigned to each key is `fill`, which is the string `"abcca"`.
6. Therefore, a dictionary `ans` is created where the key `0` has the value `"abcca"`, the key `1` has the value `"abcca"`, and the key `2` has the value `"abcca"`.
7. The resulting dictionary `ans` is `{0: 'abcca', 1: 'abcca', 2: 'abcca'}`.
8. The function returns this dictionary `ans`.
