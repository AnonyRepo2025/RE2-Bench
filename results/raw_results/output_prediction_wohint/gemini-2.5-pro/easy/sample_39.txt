Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with `array = [6, 2, 7, 1]` and `elem = 6`.
2. The `if` condition `elem in array` is evaluated. This checks if the value of `elem`, which is `6`, exists in the list `array`, which is `[6, 2, 7, 1]`.
3. The number `6` is the first element of the list `array`, so the condition `6 in [6, 2, 7, 1]` is `True`.
4. Since the condition is true, the code inside the `if` block is executed: `return array.index(elem)`.
5. `array.index(elem)` is equivalent to `[6, 2, 7, 1].index(6)`.
6. The `.index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in the list.
7. The element `6` is found at the first position in the list, which corresponds to index `0`.
8. The function returns the value `0`.
9. The `return -1` statement is never reached.
10. The final output is `0`.
