Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` step by step with the given inputs.

1.  **Function Definition:**
    ```python
    def f(list, operation):
        new_list = list[:]
        new_list.sort()
        operation(new_list)
        return list
    ```

2.  **Input Arguments:**
    - `list`: `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`
    - `operation`: A lambda function. The specific action of this lambda is not provided, but we will see if it matters.

3.  **Step-by-step execution:**
    - `new_list = list[:]`: This line is crucial. It creates a *shallow copy* of the input `list`.
        - The original `list` is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
        - `new_list` is now a new, separate list object with the same contents: `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
        - Any changes to `new_list` will not affect the original `list`.

    - `new_list.sort()`: This method sorts the `new_list` *in-place*.
        - `new_list` was `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
        - After sorting, `new_list` becomes `[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`.
        - The original `list` remains unchanged: `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.

    - `operation(new_list)`: The provided `operation` (a lambda function) is called with the sorted `new_list` (`[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`) as its argument.
        - Whatever this lambda function does (e.g., modify the list, print it, etc.), it only affects `new_list`. It does not have access to the original `list` variable from the outer scope.

    - `return list`: The function returns the value of the `list` variable. This is the *original*, unmodified list that was passed into the function.

4.  **Final Result:**
    - The function returns the original `list`, which is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`. The operations on `new_list` do not affect the final return value.

Therefore, the output of the function will be the initial list provided as input.
