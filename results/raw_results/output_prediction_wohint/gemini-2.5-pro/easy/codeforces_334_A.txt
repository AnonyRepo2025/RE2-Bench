[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of a given Python script with a specific input.

**1. Code Analysis:**
- The script starts by reading an integer `n` from the input.
- It initializes two integer variables, `i` to `1` and `j` to `n * n`.
- It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is strictly less than `j`.
- Inside the loop, it prints the current values of `i` and `j` separated by a space, followed by a newline.
- After printing, it increments `i` by 1 and decrements `j` by 1.
- The loop terminates when `i` becomes greater than or equal to `j`.

**2. Input Analysis:**
- The input provided is `"10"`.

**3. Step-by-step Execution Simulation:**
- `n = int(input())`: `n` will be assigned the integer value `10`.
- `i, j = (1, n * n)`: `i` is initialized to `1`. `j` is initialized to `10 * 10`, which is `100`.
- `while i < j:`: The loop condition `1 < 100` is true, so the loop begins.

- **Iteration 1:**
  - `i < j` is `1 < 100` (True).
  - `print(i, j)`: Prints "1 100" followed by a newline.
  - `i` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - `j` becomes `100 - 1 = 99`.

- **Iteration 2:**
  - `i < j` is `2 < 99` (True).
  - `print(i, j)`: Prints "2 99" followed by a newline.
  - `i` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
  - `j` becomes `99 - 1 = 98`.

- **... (The loop continues)**
  - In each iteration, `i` increases by 1 and `j` decreases by 1. The gap between them closes by 2.
  - The loop will continue until `i` is no longer less than `j`.

- **Finding the last iteration:**
  - The loop stops when `i >= j`.
  - Let's trace the values closer to the end.
  - Suppose `i` is `49`. `j` would be `100 - (49 - 1) = 52`. The loop continues.
  - `print(49, 52)`. `i` becomes `50`, `j` becomes `51`.

- **Last Iteration:**
  - `i < j` is `50 < 51` (True).
  - `print(i, j)`: Prints "50 51" followed by a newline.
  - `i` becomes `50 + 1 = 51`.
  - `j` becomes `51 - 1 = 50`.

- **Loop Termination Check:**
  - `i < j` is `51 < 50` (False).
  - The loop terminates.

**4. Final Output Construction:**
- The script will have printed 50 lines of output.
- Each line contains two numbers.
- The first line is "1 100".
- The last line is "50 51".
- Each `print` call adds a newline character (`\n`).
- The final output will be a single string containing all 50 lines, separated by `\n`.

The output string will be:
"1 100\n2 99\n3 98\n...\n49 52\n50 51\n"

I will now format this into the required JSON structure.
