`f` with `nums = []`.

1.  The function `f` is called with `nums` being an empty list `[]`.
2.  The code enters a `for` loop: `for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -3):`.
3.  Let's evaluate the arguments for the `range` function:
    *   `len(nums)` is `len([])`, which is `0`.
    *   The `range` becomes `range(0 - 1, -1, -3)`, which is `range(-1, -1, -3)`.
4.  The `range` function with `start` equal to `stop` (`-1` in this case) generates an empty sequence.
5.  Because the sequence generated by `range` is empty, the `for` loop will not execute its body at all.
6.  The program execution skips the loop and proceeds to the next line after the loop.
7.  The next line is `return nums`.
8.  The current value of `nums` is the original empty list `[]` that was passed into the function.
9.  The function returns `[]`.
