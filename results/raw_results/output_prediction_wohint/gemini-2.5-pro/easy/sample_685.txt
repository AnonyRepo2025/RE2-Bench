Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with `array = [1, 1, 1]` and `elem = -2`.
2. The function's body is `return array.count(elem) + elem`.
3. First, `array.count(elem)` is evaluated. This counts the number of times `elem` appears in `array`.
4. In this case, we are counting the occurrences of `-2` in the list `[1, 1, 1]`.
5. The number `-2` does not exist in the list `[1, 1, 1]`. Therefore, `array.count(-2)` evaluates to `0`.
6. Next, this result is added to `elem`. The expression becomes `0 + elem`.
7. Since `elem` is `-2`, the expression is `0 + (-2)`.
8. The final result of the addition is `-2`.
9. The function returns this value, `-2`.
