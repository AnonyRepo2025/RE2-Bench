Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `decimal_to_binary` is called with the argument `decimal = 103`.
2. Inside the function, the first operation is `bin(decimal)`. The built-in `bin()` function converts an integer to its binary representation as a string, prefixed with "0b".
3. For `decimal = 103`, `bin(103)` evaluates to the string `'0b1100111'`.
4. Next, string slicing `[2:]` is applied to the result. `_`'0b1100111'[2:]` takes the substring starting from index 2 to the end. This effectively removes the "0b" prefix. The result is `'1100111'`.
5. Finally, this binary string is concatenated with the prefix 'db' and the suffix 'db'.
6. The expression becomes `'db' + '1100111' + 'db'`, which evaluates to `'db1100111db'`.
7. The function returns this final string.
