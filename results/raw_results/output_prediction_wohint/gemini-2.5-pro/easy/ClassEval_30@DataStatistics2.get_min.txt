[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the `__init__` method:** The `DataStatistics2` class is initialized with `data = "[ 0 -1 -3  2]"`.
2.  Inside `__init__`, `self.data = np.array(data)` is executed.
3.  The input `data` is a single string: `"[ 0 -1 -3  2]"`.
4.  When `np.array()` is called with a single string, it creates a NumPy array containing that single string as its only element. It does not parse the string to create an array of numbers.
5.  So, `self.data` becomes a NumPy array like `array('[ 0 -1 -3  2]', dtype='<U13')`. It's an array with one element, which is the string itself.
6.  **Analyze the `get_min` method:** The `get_min` method is called.
7.  It executes `return np.min(self.data)`.
8.  `np.min` is called on the array `array('[ 0 -1 -3  2]')`.
9.  The minimum value of a NumPy array containing only one element is that element itself.
10. Therefore, `np.min` will return the single string element: `"[ 0 -1 -3  2]"`.
11. The function `get_min` returns this string.
