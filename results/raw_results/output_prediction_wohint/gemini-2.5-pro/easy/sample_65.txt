[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the Python function `f`.

**Function:**
```python
def f(nums, index):
    return nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2
```

**Inputs:**
- `nums`: `[3, 2, 0, 7]`
- `index`: `3`

**Step-by-step execution simulation:**

1.  The function `f` is called with `nums = [3, 2, 0, 7]` and `index = 3`.
2.  The `return` statement `nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2` is evaluated.
3.  Python evaluates expressions from left to right. The operands for the `+` operator are evaluated in order.
4.  **First operand evaluation:** `nums[index] % 42`
    *   At this point, `nums` is `[3, 2, 0, 7]` and `index` is `3`.
    *   `nums[index]` is `nums[3]`, which is `7`.
    *   The expression becomes `7 % 42`.
    *   The result of the modulo operation `7 % 42` is `7`.
5.  **Second operand evaluation:** `nums.pop(index) * 2`
    *   The `nums.pop(index)` part is evaluated.
    *   `index` is `3`.
    *   `nums.pop(3)` is called on the list `[3, 2, 0, 7]`.
    *   This method removes the element at index 3 (which is the value `7`) and returns it.
    *   Crucially, the `pop` method modifies the list `nums` in-place. The list `nums` now becomes `[3, 2, 0]`.
    *   The value returned by `nums.pop(3)` is `7`.
    *   The expression becomes `7 * 2`, which evaluates to `14`.
6.  **Final calculation:** The results of the two operands are added together.
    *   `7` (from the first operand) + `14` (from the second operand).
    *   The sum is `21`.
7.  The function returns the final result, which is `21`.

It is important to note that if the expression were `nums.pop(index) * 2 + nums[index] % 42`, the result would be an `IndexError`. This is because `nums.pop(3)` would execute first, shortening the list to `[3, 2, 0]`. Then, when `nums[index]` (i.e., `nums[3]`) is accessed, index 3 would be out of bounds for the now-shorter list. However, due to Python's left-to-right evaluation order, the simulation above is the correct one.
