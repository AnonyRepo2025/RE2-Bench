Let's execute the code step by step.
1.  The function `f` is called with the dictionary `dct = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}`.
2.  An empty list `lst` is initialized: `lst = []`.
3.  The code starts a `for` loop over `sorted(dct)`.
4.  `dct.keys()` would be `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
5.  `sorted(dct)` sorts the keys of the dictionary alphabetically. Since the keys are already in order, `sorted(dct)` evaluates to `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
6.  The loop will iterate through this sorted list of keys.
7.  **First iteration:** `key` is `'a'`.
    *   The line `lst.append((key, dct[key]))` is executed.
    *   `dct[key]` is `dct['a']`, which is `1`.
    *   A tuple `('a', 1)` is created and appended to `lst`.
    *   `lst` is now `[('a', 1)]`.
8.  **Second iteration:** `key` is `'b'`.
    *   `dct[key]` is `dct['b']`, which is `2`.
    *   A tuple `('b', 2)` is appended to `lst`.
    *   `lst` is now `[('a', 1), ('b', 2)]`.
9.  **Third iteration:** `key` is `'c'`.
    *   `dct[key]` is `dct['c']`, which is `3`.
    *   A tuple `('c', 3)` is appended to `lst`.
    *   `lst` is now `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`.
10. The loop finishes.
11. The function returns the final list `lst`, which is `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`.
12. In JSON format, a list of tuples is represented as a list of lists.
