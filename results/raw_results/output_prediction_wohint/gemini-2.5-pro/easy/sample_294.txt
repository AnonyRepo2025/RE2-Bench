Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` step by step with the given inputs.

**Function:**
```python
def f(n, m, text):
    if text.strip() == '':
        return text
    head, mid, tail = (text[0], text[1:-1], text[-1])
    joined = head.replace(n, m) + mid.replace(n, m) + tail.replace(n, m)
    return joined
```

**Inputs:**
- `n` = "x"
- `m` = "$"
- `text` = "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"

**Execution Analysis:**

1.  The function `f` is called with `n="x"`, `m="$"`, and `text="2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"`.

2.  The first line inside the function is `if text.strip() == '':`.
    - `text.strip()` on "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris" results in "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris".
    - This is not an empty string (`''`).
    - The condition is `False`, so the `if` block is skipped.

3.  The next line is `head, mid, tail = (text[0], text[1:-1], text[-1])`. This unpacks the `text` string into three parts:
    - `head = text[0]`: The first character of the string. `head` becomes "2".
    - `tail = text[-1]`: The last character of the string. `tail` becomes "s".
    - `mid = text[1:-1]`: The substring from the second character up to, but not including, the last character. `mid` becomes "xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri".

4.  The next line is `joined = head.replace(n, m) + mid.replace(n, m) + tail.replace(n, m)`. This line performs replacements on each part and then concatenates them.
    - `head.replace(n, m)`: This is `"2".replace("x", "$")`. Since "2" does not contain "x", the result is "2".
    - `mid.replace(n, m)`: This is `"xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri".replace("x", "$")`. The character 'x' is found and replaced with '$'. The result is "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri".
    - `tail.replace(n, m)`: This is `"s".replace("x", "$")`. Since "s" does not contain "x", the result is "s".
    - The three results are concatenated: `"2" + "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri" + "s"`.
    - The final value of `joined` is "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris".

5.  Finally, `return joined` is executed. The function returns the string "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris".
