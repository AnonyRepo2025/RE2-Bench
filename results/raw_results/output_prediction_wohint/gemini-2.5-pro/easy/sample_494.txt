Let's execute the code step by step.
1.  The function `f` is called with `num = "1"` and `l = 3`.
2.  A variable `t` is initialized as an empty string: `t = ''`.
3.  The `while` loop starts. The condition is `l > len(num)`.
4.  **First iteration:**
    *   `l` is 3.
    *   `len(num)` is `len("1")`, which is 1.
    *   The condition `3 > 1` is `True`.
    *   The loop body executes.
    *   `t` is updated: `t = t + '0'`, so `t` becomes `'0'`.
    *   `l` is decremented: `l = l - 1`, so `l` becomes `2`.
5.  **Second iteration:**
    *   The condition `l > len(num)` is checked again.
    *   `l` is 2.
    *   `len(num)` is still 1.
    *   The condition `2 > 1` is `True`.
    *   The loop body executes.
    *   `t` is updated: `t = t + '0'`, so `t` becomes `'00'`.
    *   `l` is decremented: `l = l - 1`, so `l` becomes `1`.
6.  **Third iteration:**
    *   The condition `l > len(num)` is checked again.
    *   `l` is 1.
    *   `len(num)` is still 1.
    *   The condition `1 > 1` is `False`.
    *   The loop terminates.
7.  The function returns the result of `t + num`.
    *   `t` is `'00'`.
    *   `num` is `'1'`.
    *   The concatenation `'00' + '1'` results in `'001'`.
8.  The final return value is the string `'001'`.
