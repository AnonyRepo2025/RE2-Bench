Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with two arguments: `array` and `elem`.
2. The initial value of `array` is `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]`.
3. The value of `elem` is `[[1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]`.
4. The line `array.extend(elem)` is executed. The `extend()` method adds the elements of an iterable (in this case, the list `elem`) to the end of the list `array`. It does not append the list `elem` as a single element, but rather iterates through `elem` and appends each of its items individually.
5. The first element of `elem`, which is `[1, 2, 3]`, is appended to `array`. `array` becomes `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1], [1, 2, 3]]`.
6. The second element of `elem`, which is `3`, is appended to `array`. `array` becomes `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1], [1, 2, 3], 3]`.
7. The third element of `elem`, which is `[2, 1]`, is appended to `array`. `array` becomes `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1], [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]`.
8. The function then returns the modified `array`.
9. The final returned value is `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1], [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]`.
