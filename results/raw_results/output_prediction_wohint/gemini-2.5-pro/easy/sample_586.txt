Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with `text = "breakfast"` and `char = "e"`.
2. The function's body executes the statement `text.rindex(char)`.
3. The `rindex()` method is a string method that finds the last (right-most) index of a substring within the string.
4. In this case, we are looking for the last index of the character `"e"` in the string `"breakfast"`.
5. Let's write down the string and its indices:
   - `b` is at index 0
   - `r` is at index 1
   - `e` is at index 2
   - `a` is at index 3
   - `k` is at index 4
   - `f` is at index 5
   - `a` is at index 6
   - `s` is at index 7
   - `t` is at index 8
6. The character `"e"` appears only once in the string `"breakfast"`, at index 2.
7. Therefore, `rindex()` will return 2.
8. The function returns this value.
