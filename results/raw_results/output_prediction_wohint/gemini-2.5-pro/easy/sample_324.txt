[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` with the given input `nums = []`.

1.  **`def f(nums):`**: The function `f` is called with the argument `nums` set to `[]`.

2.  **`asc, desc = (nums.copy(), [])`**:
    *   `nums.copy()` is called on `[]`. This creates a shallow copy, which is also an empty list `[]`.
    *   `asc` is assigned the value `[]`.
    *   `desc` is assigned the value `[]`.
    *   At this point, `asc` is `[]` and `desc` is `[]`.

3.  **`asc.reverse()`**:
    *   The `reverse()` method is called on the list `asc`.
    *   Reversing an empty list `[]` results in the same empty list `[]`.
    *   `asc` remains `[]`.

4.  **`desc = asc[:len(asc) // 2]`**:
    *   `len(asc)` is `len([])`, which is `0`.
    *   The expression `len(asc) // 2` evaluates to `0 // 2`, which is `0`.
    *   The slice `asc[:0]` is taken. Slicing an empty list up to index 0 results in an empty list `[]`.
    *   The variable `desc` is reassigned to this new empty list `[]`.
    *   So, `desc` is still `[]`.

5.  **`return desc + asc + desc`**:
    *   The function returns the concatenation of the three lists: `desc`, `asc`, and `desc`.
    *   This evaluates to `[] + [] + []`.
    *   Concatenating empty lists results in a single empty list `[]`.

6.  **Final Result**: The function returns `[]`.
