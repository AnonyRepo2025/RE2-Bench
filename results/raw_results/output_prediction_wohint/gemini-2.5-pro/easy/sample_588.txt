Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with two arguments: `items` and `target`.
2. `items` is initialized to the list `["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]`.
3. `target` is initialized to the string `"**"`.
4. The code first checks `if target in items:`. This evaluates to `if "**" in ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]`.
5. The string `"**"` is present in the `items` list. Therefore, the condition is `True`.
6. The code inside the `if` block is executed: `return items.index(target)`.
7. `items.index(target)` will find the index of the first occurrence of the `target` value within the `items` list.
8. The `target` is `"**"`. Let's find its index in the list `["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]`:
   - Index 0: "1"
   - Index 1: "+"
   - Index 2: "-"
   - Index 3: "**"
9. The `index()` method finds `"**"` at index 3.
10. The function returns the value `3`.
