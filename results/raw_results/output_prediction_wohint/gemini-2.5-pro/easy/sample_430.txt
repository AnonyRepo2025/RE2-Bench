Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with two arguments, `arr1` and `arr2`.
2. `arr1` is initialized to the list `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]`.
3. `arr2` is initialized to the list `["", 0, -1, []]`.
4. Inside the function, `new_arr = arr1.copy()` creates a shallow copy of `arr1`. So, `new_arr` becomes `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]`.
5. `new_arr.extend(arr2)` is called. The `extend()` method appends all the elements from the iterable `arr2` to the end of the list `new_arr`.
6. The elements of `arr2` (`""`, `0`, `-1`, `[]`) are added to `new_arr`.
7. After the `extend` operation, `new_arr` becomes `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.
8. The function returns the modified `new_arr`.
9. The final returned value is the list `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.
