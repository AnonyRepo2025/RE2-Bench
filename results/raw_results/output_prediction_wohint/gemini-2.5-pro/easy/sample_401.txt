Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with `text = "mathematics"` and `suffix = "example"`.
2. The `if` statement checks the condition `suffix and text.endswith(suffix)`.
3. The first part of the condition, `suffix`, is evaluated. The value of `suffix` is "example", which is a non-empty string, so it evaluates to `True` in a boolean context.
4. The second part of the condition, `text.endswith(suffix)`, is evaluated. This checks if the string "mathematics" ends with the string "example".
5. "mathematics" does not end with "example", so `text.endswith(suffix)` evaluates to `False`.
6. The entire `if` condition is `True and False`, which results in `False`.
7. Since the condition is false, the code block inside the `if` statement is skipped.
8. The function proceeds to the next line, which is `return text`.
9. The function returns the current value of the `text` variable, which is "mathematics".
