[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the function:** The user wants me to predict the output of the `read_file_as_json` method of the `TextFileProcessor` class.
2.  **Function Logic:**
    *   The method takes no arguments besides `self`.
    *   It accesses the `file_path` attribute from the `self` object.
    *   It attempts to open the file at `self.file_path` in read mode (`'r'`).
    *   It then uses `json.load()` to parse the file's content as JSON.
    *   Finally, it returns the parsed Python object (dictionary or list).
3.  **Analyze the Input:**
    *   The `self` object has an attribute `file_path` with the value `"test_2.txt"`.
    *   The method is called with no additional arguments.
4.  **Simulate Execution:**
    *   The method is called. `self.file_path` is `"test_2.txt"`.
    *   The line `with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:` is executed.
    *   This attempts to open a file named `"test_2.txt"` from the file system.
    *   The problem description does not provide any information about the file system state or the contents of any files. In a sandboxed execution environment where no files are pre-populated, attempting to open a file that doesn't exist will raise an error.
    *   The `open()` function will raise a `FileNotFoundError` because `"test_2.txt"` does not exist.
    *   The `read_file_as_json` method does not have a `try...except` block to handle this `FileNotFoundError`.
    *   Therefore, the exception will not be caught, and the program will terminate, raising the `FileNotFoundError`.
5.  **Predict the Output:**
    *   The output is not a successful return value but an unhandled exception.
    *   The exception will be `FileNotFoundError`.
    *   The standard error message for this exception includes the OS-level error number (`[Errno 2]`) and the message "No such file or directory", followed by the file path that was not found.
    *   So, the expected exception is `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'test_2.txt'`.
    *   I will format this as the output.
