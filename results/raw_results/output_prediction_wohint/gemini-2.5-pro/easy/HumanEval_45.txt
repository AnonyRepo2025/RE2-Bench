Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `triangle_area` is called with the arguments `a` and `h`.
2. From the input, the value of `a` is `10`.
3. From the input, the value of `h` is `8`.
4. The function calculates the expression `a * h / 2.0`.
5. Substituting the values: `10 * 8 / 2.0`.
6. First, the multiplication is performed: `10 * 8` equals `80`.
7. Then, the division is performed: `80 / 2.0`. Since we are dividing by a float (`2.0`), the result will also be a float.
8. `80 / 2.0` equals `40.0`.
9. The function returns the value `40.0`.
