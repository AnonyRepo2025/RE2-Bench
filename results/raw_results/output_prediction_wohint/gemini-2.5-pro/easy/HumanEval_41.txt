Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `car_race_collision` is called with the argument `n`.
2. From the input, the value of `n` is `8`.
3. The function body contains a single statement: `return n ** 2`.
4. The `**` operator in Python is the exponentiation operator. So, `n ** 2` calculates `n` raised to the power of 2, which is equivalent to `n * n`.
5. Substituting `n` with `8`, the expression becomes `8 ** 2`.
6. `8 ** 2` evaluates to `8 * 8`, which is `64`.
7. The function returns the result, `64`.
