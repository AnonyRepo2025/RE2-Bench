[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` step by step with the given input `text = "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.

1.  **Function Call:** The function `f` is called with `text = "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.

2.  **`text.split()`:** The code first calls `text.split()`. This method splits the string by any whitespace and returns a list of the words.
    *   Input string: `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`
    *   The only whitespace is between `"in"` and `"soup-.-"`.
    *   Result of `split()`: `['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-']`

3.  **`for` loop:** The code starts iterating through the list `['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-']`.

    *   **First Iteration:** `item` is `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in'`.
        *   The line `text = text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ').replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')` is executed.
        *   First `replace`: `'-{}'.format(item)` becomes `'-' + '-stew---corn-and-beans-in'`, which is `'--stew---corn-and-beans-in'`. The code tries to replace this substring in the current `text`. The current `text` is still `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`. This substring is not found, so no replacement occurs.
        *   Second `replace`: `'{}-'.format(item)` becomes `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in' + '-'`, which is `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in-'`. The code tries to replace this substring in `text`. This substring is also not found.
        *   At the end of the first iteration, the `text` variable remains unchanged: `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.

    *   **Second Iteration:** `item` is `'soup-.-'`.
        *   The line `text = text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ').replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')` is executed again.
        *   First `replace`: `'-{}'.format(item)` becomes `'-' + 'soup-.-'`, which is `'-soup-.-'`. The code looks for `'-soup-.-'` in the current `text` (`"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`). It finds it.
        *   The substring `'-soup-.-'` is replaced with a single space `' '`.
        *   The `text` variable is updated to `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in "`.
        *   Second `replace`: `'{}-'.format(item)` becomes `'soup-.-' + '-'`, which is `'soup-.- -'`. The code tries to replace this substring in the now-updated `text` (`"-stew---corn-and-beans-in "`). This substring is not found.
        *   At the end of the second iteration, the `text` variable is `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in "`.

4.  **Loop End:** The loop has finished processing all items from the `split()` list.

5.  **`return text.strip('-')`:** The function returns the final value of `text` after applying the `.strip('-')` method.
    *   `text` is `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in "`.
    *   `.strip('-')` removes any leading or trailing hyphens (`-`) from the string.
    *   The string starts with a hyphen, so it is removed.
    *   The string ends with a space, not a hyphen, so nothing is removed from the end.
    *   The final result is `"stew---corn-and-beans-in "`.

6.  **Final Output:** The function will return the string `"stew---corn-and-beans-in "`.
