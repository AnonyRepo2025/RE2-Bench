[THOUGHT]
1.  The user wants me to simulate the execution of the `__delitem__` method of the `CamelCaseMap` class.
2.  The `__delitem__` method is called with `self` (an instance of `CamelCaseMap` where `_data` is `{}`) and `key` which is the string `"first_name"`.
3.  The method's body is `del self._data[self._convert_key(key)]`.
4.  First, `self._convert_key(key)` is called with `key = "first_name"`.
5.  Inside `_convert_key`, the condition `isinstance(key, str)` is checked. `"first_name"` is a string, so this is true.
6.  The code then attempts to execute `return self._to_camel_case(key)`.
7.  Looking at the provided `CamelCaseMap` class definition, there is no method named `_to_camel_case`.
8.  When a program tries to call a method that does not exist on an object, Python raises an `AttributeError`.
9.  Therefore, the execution will stop at this point and an `AttributeError` will be raised, with a message indicating that the `_to_camel_case` attribute is missing.
