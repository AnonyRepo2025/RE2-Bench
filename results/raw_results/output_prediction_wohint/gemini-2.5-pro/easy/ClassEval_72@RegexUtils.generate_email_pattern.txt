[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants me to predict the output of the `generate_email_pattern` method from the `RegexUtils` class.

2.  **Examine the Python Code:**
    *   The `RegexUtils` class has one method: `generate_email_pattern`.
    *   This method takes `self` as an argument but doesn't use it.
    *   It defines a local variable `pattern` and assigns it a hardcoded string value: `'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`.
    *   It then returns this `pattern` string.

3.  **Review the Input:**
    *   `self`: An empty object. This is sufficient since the method doesn't access any instance attributes (like `self.some_variable`).
    *   `args`: Empty. The method takes no positional arguments besides `self`.
    *   `kwargs`: Empty. The method takes no keyword arguments.
    *   The provided inputs are valid for calling the method.

4.  **Simulate Execution:**
    *   The `generate_email_pattern` method is called.
    *   The line `pattern = '\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'` is executed. The string literal is assigned to the `pattern` variable.
    *   The line `return pattern` is executed.
    *   The function will return the exact string that was assigned to the `pattern` variable.

5.  **Determine the Output:**
    *   The return value is the string: `\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b`.
    *   This is a regular expression pattern for matching email addresses. The function simply returns this predefined pattern as a string.

6.  **Format the Output:**
    *   The output needs to be in JSON format.
    *   The key for the return value is `output`.
    *   The value is the string determined in the previous step.
    *   The final JSON will be `{"output": "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"}`. The backslashes in the Python string literal are already escaped, and this is the correct representation for a JSON string as well.
