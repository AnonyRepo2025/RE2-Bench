Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with the dictionary `d = {"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`.
2. Inside the function, the first line is `d = d.copy()`. This creates a shallow copy of the input dictionary. The local variable `d` inside the function is now a new dictionary object `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`, separate from the one passed as an argument.
3. The next line is `d.popitem()`. This method removes and returns the last key-value pair from the dictionary. In Python 3.7+, dictionaries preserve insertion order, so `popitem()` removes items in LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) order. The last item inserted into the dictionary was `"x:": 3`.
4. After `d.popitem()` is executed, the local dictionary `d` is modified to `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`.
5. Finally, the function returns the modified local dictionary `d`.
6. The returned value is `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`.
