Let's execute the code step by step with the given inputs.

1.  **Function `f` is called with `text = "undbs l"` and `position = 1`.**

2.  **`length = len(text)`**:
    *   The input `text` is "undbs l".
    *   The length of this string is 7.
    *   The variable `length` is assigned the value 7.

3.  **`index = position % (length + 1)`**:
    *   `position` is 1.
    *   `length + 1` is 7 + 1 = 8.
    *   The expression becomes `1 % 8`.
    *   The modulo operator `%` gives the remainder of a division. The remainder of 1 divided by 8 is 1.
    *   The variable `index` is assigned the value 1.

4.  **`if position < 0 or index < 0:`**:
    *   `position` is 1, which is not less than 0.
    *   `index` is 1, which is not less than 0.
    *   The condition `(1 < 0)` is `False` and `(1 < 0)` is `False`.
    *   The overall condition `False or False` is `False`.
    *   The code block inside the `if` statement is skipped.

5.  **`new_text = list(text)`**:
    *   The string `text` ("undbs l") is converted into a list of its characters.
    *   `new_text` becomes `['u', 'n', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l']`.

6.  **`new_text.pop(index)`**:
    *   `index` is 1.
    *   The `pop(1)` method is called on the `new_text` list. This removes the element at index 1.
    *   The element at index 1 is 'n'.
    *   After removal, `new_text` becomes `['u', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l']`.

7.  **`return ''.join(new_text)`**:
    *   The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the `new_text` list into a single string. The separator is an empty string `''`.
    *   `''.join(['u', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l'])` results in the string "udbs l".

8.  **The function returns the final string "udbs l".**
