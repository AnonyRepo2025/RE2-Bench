Let's execute the code step by step.
1.  **Analyze the initial state:** The `VendingMachine` instance (`self`) starts with a `balance` of `5.0`.
2.  **Identify the method call:** The `insert_coin` method is called.
3.  **Identify the arguments:** The `amount` passed to the method is `1.25`.
4.  **Execute the method body:**
    *   `self.balance += amount`: The current `balance` (`5.0`) is increased by the `amount` (`1.25`). The new balance becomes `5.0 + 1.25 = 6.25`.
    *   `return self.balance`: The method returns the updated `balance`, which is `6.25`.
5.  **Determine the final output:** The function returns the value `6.25`.
