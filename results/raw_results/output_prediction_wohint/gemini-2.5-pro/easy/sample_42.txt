`f` with `nums = []`.

1.  **`nums.clear()`**: The `clear()` method is called on the input list `nums`. The list `nums` is initially `[]`. After `clear()`, it remains `[]`.
2.  **`for num in nums:`**: The code starts a `for` loop to iterate over the elements in the `nums` list.
3.  **Loop Execution**: At this point, `nums` is an empty list `[]`. Since there are no elements in the list, the loop will not execute even once. The body of the loop, `nums.append(num * 2)`, is never reached.
4.  **`return nums`**: The function returns the current value of the `nums` list. Since the loop did not modify the list, `nums` is still `[]`.
5.  **Final Output**: The function returns `[]`.
