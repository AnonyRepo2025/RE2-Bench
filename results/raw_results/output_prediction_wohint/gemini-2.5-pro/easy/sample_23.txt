[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the Python function `f` with the given inputs.

**Function:**
```python
def f(text, chars):
    if chars:
        text = text.rstrip(chars)
    else:
        text = text.rstrip(' ')
    if text == '':
        return '-'
    return text
```

**Inputs:**
- `text`: "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"
- `chars`: "0123456789-"

**Step-by-step execution simulation:**

1.  The function `f` is called with `text` = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2" and `chars` = "0123456789-".
2.  The first `if` statement checks `if chars:`. The `chars` string is "0123456789-", which is not empty. In a boolean context, a non-empty string evaluates to `True`.
3.  The condition is `True`, so the code inside the `if` block is executed: `text = text.rstrip(chars)`.
4.  The `rstrip(chars)` method removes any characters from the end (right side) of the `text` string that are present in the `chars` string. The stripping continues from right to left until a character not in `chars` is encountered.
5.  The input `text` is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2".
6.  The `chars` to be removed are "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", and "-".
7.  Let's examine the end of the `text` string:
    - The last character is '2'. Is '2' in `chars`? Yes. It is marked for removal.
    - The character before that is '.'. Is '.' in `chars`? No.
8.  The stripping process stops at the first character from the right that is not found in `chars`. Therefore, only the trailing '2' is removed.
9.  The new value of `text` becomes "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.".
10. The next `if` statement checks `if text == '':`. The current value of `text` is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.", which is not an empty string. The condition is `False`.
11. The `else` part of this `if` statement is to `return text`.
12. The function returns the final value of `text`, which is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.".
