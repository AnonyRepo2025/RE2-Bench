[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the execution of the Python function `f` with the given input `nums = [1, 3, 3]`.

1.  **Function Call:** The function `f` is called with `nums = [1, 3, 3]`.

2.  **Loop Initialization:** The `for` loop starts. The expression `range(len(nums))` is evaluated *once* at the beginning of the loop.
    *   `len(nums)` is `len([1, 3, 3])`, which is 3.
    *   So, the loop will iterate for `i` in `range(3)`, meaning `i` will take the values 0, 1, and 2. The number of iterations is fixed at 3, regardless of whether the list `nums` changes size during the loop.

3.  **First Iteration (i = 0):**
    *   The loop checks the element at index `i=0`. `nums[0]` is `1`.
    *   The condition `nums[i] % 3 == 0` becomes `1 % 3 == 0`, which is `False`.
    *   The `if` block is skipped.
    *   At the end of this iteration, `nums` is still `[1, 3, 3]`.

4.  **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
    *   The loop checks the element at index `i=1`. `nums[1]` is `3`.
    *   The condition `nums[i] % 3 == 0` becomes `3 % 3 == 0`, which is `True`.
    *   The `if` block is executed: `nums.append(nums[i])`.
    *   `nums[i]` is `3`, so `nums.append(3)` is called.
    *   The list `nums` is modified in place. It becomes `[1, 3, 3, 3]`.

5.  **Third Iteration (i = 2):**
    *   The loop checks the element at index `i=2`.
    *   The current state of `nums` is `[1, 3, 3, 3]`.
    *   `nums[2]` is `3`.
    *   The condition `nums[i] % 3 == 0` becomes `3 % 3 == 0`, which is `True`.
    *   The `if` block is executed: `nums.append(nums[i])`.
    *   `nums[i]` is `3`, so `nums.append(3)` is called.
    *   The list `nums` is modified again. It becomes `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.

6.  **End of Loop:** The loop has completed its 3 iterations (for `i = 0, 1, 2`).

7.  **Return Statement:** The function returns the final state of the `nums` list.

8.  **Final Output:** The returned value is `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
