Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is called with two arguments: `num` and `name`.
2. From the input, `num` is assigned the integer value `23`.
3. From the input, `name` is assigned the string value `"Cornareti"`.
4. Inside the function, a string variable `f_str` is defined as `'quiz leader = {}, count = {}'`. This string contains two placeholders, `{}`.
5. The function then calls the `.format()` method on `f_str`. The arguments passed to `.format()` are `name` and `num`, in that order.
6. The first placeholder `{}` in `f_str` is replaced by the value of the first argument to `.format()`, which is `name` ("Cornareti").
7. The second placeholder `{}` in `f_str` is replaced by the value of the second argument to `.format()`, which is `num` (23).
8. The resulting string is `'quiz leader = Cornareti, count = 23'`.
9. This string is returned by the function.
