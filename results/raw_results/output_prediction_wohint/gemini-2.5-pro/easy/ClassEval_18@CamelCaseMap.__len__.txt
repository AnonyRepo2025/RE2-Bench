[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the output of the `__len__` method for the `CamelCaseMap` class.

1.  **Analyze the `CamelCaseMap` class:**
    *   The `__init__` method initializes an instance attribute `_data` as an empty dictionary.
    *   The `__len__` method is defined to return the length of the `self._data` dictionary. The `len()` function, when called on a dictionary, returns the number of key-value pairs.

2.  **Analyze the input:**
    *   The `self` object is provided. Its `_data` attribute is not empty; it's initialized to `{"firstName": "John"}`.
    *   The `args` and `kwargs` are empty, which is correct as `__len__` takes no arguments besides `self`.

3.  **Simulate the execution of `__len__`:**
    *   The method `__len__` is called on the `self` instance.
    *   The code inside the method is `return len(self._data)`.
    *   The value of `self._data` is `{"firstName": "John"}`.
    *   The `len()` function is called on this dictionary: `len({"firstName": "John"})`.
    *   This dictionary contains exactly one key-value pair.
    *   Therefore, `len()` will return `1`.

4.  **Format the output:**
    *   The output needs to be in JSON format.
    *   The key will be "output" and the value will be the integer `1`.
    *   The final JSON will be `{"output": 1}`.
