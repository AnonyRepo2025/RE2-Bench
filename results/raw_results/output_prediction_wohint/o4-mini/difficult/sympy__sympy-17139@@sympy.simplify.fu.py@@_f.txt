[THOUGHT]
We are examining the inner function `_f(rv)` defined in `_TR56`. The very first check in `_f` is:

    if not (rv.is_Pow and rv.base.func == f):
        return rv

Here our input `rv` is the SymPy expression `-I*sin(x)`. That is a `Mul` (product), not a `Pow`. Therefore `rv.is_Pow` is False, so the condition `not (False and ...)` is True, and `_f` immediately returns its input unchanged. No further checks or transformations occur.

  "retval": "-I*sin(x)"
