We call `_get_params(self, attr="_transformers", deep=True)`.

1. First line:  
   out = super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=True)  
   This invokes `BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=True)`, which walks the estimator’s `__init__` signature and returns a dict of all init‐args to their current values.  From the provided `self` attributes we get:

   {
     "n_jobs": 1,
     "remainder": { "with_mean": True, "with_std": False, "copy": True },
     "transformer_weights": None,
     "transformers": None
   }

   (Any other init‐args not shown in `self` would get their default values, but here only these four appear.)

2. Since `deep=True`, we continue.  
   estimators = getattr(self, "_transformers")  
   Here `_transformers` is the method that would normally return the list of (name, transformer) pairs.  But since no transformers were supplied (`self.transformers is None`), we can assume `_transformers()` ⇒ an empty list.  Hence `estimators = []`.

3. `out.update(estimators)` is a no‐op on an empty list.

4. The subsequent loop `for name, estimator in estimators:` also does nothing (no nested transformers to expand).

5. We return `out` unchanged.

Thus the final returned dict is:
{
  "n_jobs": 1,
  "remainder": { "with_mean": True, "with_std": False, "copy": True },
  "transformer_weights": null,
  "transformers": null
}
