[THOUGHT]
We call is_valid_move with pos1 = (0,0), pos2 = (0,1).

1. Bounds check:
   0 ≤ x1=0 < 4, 0 ≤ y1=0 < 4,
   0 ≤ x2=0 < 4, 0 ≤ y2=1 < 4 — all inside the 4×4 board.

2. pos1 != pos2: (0,0) ≠ (0,1) — OK.

3. Check matching icons:
   board[0][0] = "a"
   board[0][1] = "b"
   They are not equal, so immediately return False.

No need to check path. The move is invalid because the tiles differ.

Therefore, is_valid_move returns False.
