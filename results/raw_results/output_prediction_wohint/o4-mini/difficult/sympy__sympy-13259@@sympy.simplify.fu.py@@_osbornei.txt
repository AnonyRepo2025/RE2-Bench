[THOUGHT]
The function `_osbornei(e, d)` does a bottom‐up walk over the expression `e` and, for each trigonometric function `rv = sin, cos, tan, …`, replaces it according to the rules:
  a = shift argument by replacing `d→1` and adding `const*I` where `const` is the part of the argument independent of `d`.
  sin → sinh(a)/I, cos → cosh(a), tan → tanh(a)/I, etc.

Here the input is 
  e = 2*I*tan(_Dummy_561*x)
and we must take 
  d = _Dummy_561
(the dummy symbol with respect to which we shift).

1. Bottom‐up first visits the leaf `tan(_Dummy_561*x)`.
2. For `rv = tan(_Dummy_561*x)`, we call `rv.args[0].as_independent(d, as_Add=True)`.  
   - The argument is `_Dummy_561*x`.  
   - As an additive split, there is no constant term independent of `d`, so  
     const = 0,  remainder = _Dummy_561*x.
3. Compute  
     a = remainder.xreplace({d: 1}) + const*I  
       = ( _Dummy_561*x ).xreplace({ _Dummy_561: 1 }) + 0  
       = x.
4. Since `rv.func is tan`, we return  
     tanh(a) / I  
     = tanh(x) / I.
5. Reassembling the original factor 2*I gives  
     2*I * (tanh(x)/I) = 2*tanh(x).

No other trigonometric subexpressions exist, so the final result is  
   2*tanh(x)
