[THOUGHT]
We are calling Pipeline.fit with self.steps = None.

Inside Pipeline.fit, the first line that touches steps is something like:
    for name, transform in self.steps[:-1]:
Since self.steps is None, evaluating self.steps[:-1] raises a TypeError:
    TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
No further code is executed.
