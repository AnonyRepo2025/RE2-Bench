[THOUGHT]
1. The input string is sympified into the Sympy expression  
   `-(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`.  
2. Inside `do`, the first `if` sees that the expression is a `Basic` and `iterable`, so it simply recurses into its arguments:
   - For the `Pow` sub-expressions `(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`, `expr.is_Pow` is true, so it again recurses into their arguments.
   - All sub-calls to `do` return their inputs unchanged because no further transformation rules apply.
3. Since none of the recursive calls change any sub-expression, `do` returns the original Sympy expression unchanged.

Therefore the output is the same as the sympified input expression.
