[THOUGHT]
We have y_true and y_pred of length 100, with exactly 3 classes {0,1,2}.  From the way the arrays are printed, there are

– 40 entries of 0 in y_true  
– 56 entries of 1 in y_true  
– 4 entries of 2 in y_true  

and y_pred makes exactly the same calls at each position (the 0s in y_true are all predicted as 0, the 1s as 1, the 2s as 2).  Thus there are no off‐diagonal counts, and the confusion matrix (with default labels=[0,1,2], no weights, no normalization) is a 3×3 array with the class counts on the diagonal:

cm[0,0] = 40  
cm[1,1] = 56  
cm[2,2] = 4  

all off‐diagonal entries = 0.
