First problem (mktemp):

[THOUGHT]
1. mktemp is called with basename="world" and numbered=True (the default).  
2. Since numbered=True, it invokes make_numbered_dir(root=self.getbasetemp(), prefix="world").  
3. getbasetemp sees that _basetemp is None but _given_basetemp is set to "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0".  
4. It uses that as the base temp, resets/creates it if needed, resolves it, stores it in self._basetemp, and returns the Path("/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0").  
5. make_numbered_dir then looks at existing entries under that directory with names starting with "world", finds none, so max_existing = -1, new_number = 0.  
6. It creates the directory "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world0", updates the "worldcurrent" symlink, and returns the Path for the newly created directory.  
7. mktemp returns that Path.

[OUTPUT]
{
  "return_value": "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world0"
}
[/OUTPUT]


Second problem (_eval_subs):

[THOUGHT]
We are invoking Basic._subs (the fallback‐capable common routine) on an Application‐like object:

1. It first checks if self and old are literally the same expression (_aresame).  They’re not, so it proceeds.
2. It calls self._eval_subs(old, new).  In Application._eval_subs, it only returns a substitution if 
   - old.is_Function and new.is_Function and callable(old) and callable(new),
   - old == self.func,
   - len(self.args) ∈ new.nargs.
   We have no evidence those hold, so Application._eval_subs returns None.
3. Since rv is None, it falls back to the “fallback” helper:
   - It iterates over self.args; but no args were given, so the loop never sets hit=True.
   - Because hit is still False, fallback returns the original self unchanged.
4. Hence _subs returns self.

{
  "return_value": {
    "nargs": {}
