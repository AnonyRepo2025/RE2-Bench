[THOUGHT]
Compute player hand value:
- Cards: "2S" → 2, "4S" → 4, "5S" → 5
- Total = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 (no aces to adjust)

Compute dealer hand value:
- Cards: "2S" → 2, "JS" → 10, "QS" → 10
- Total = 2 + 10 + 10 = 22 (no aces to adjust)

Since dealer_value (22) > 21 and player_value (11) ≤ 21, the dealer busts and the player wins.
