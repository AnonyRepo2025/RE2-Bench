[THOUGHT]
We call self.col_join(other) with
- self having rows=0, cols=0, _smat={}
- other having rows=2, cols=1, _mat=null

1. The method starts:
   if self.rows==0 and self.cols!=other.cols:
     0==0 is True, and 0!=1 is True ⇒ True
   So it returns
     self._new(0, other.cols, []).col_join(other)

2. `self._new(0,1,[])` constructs a new 0×1 sparse matrix A₀ with rows=0, cols=1, _smat={ }.

3. We then call A₀.col_join(other):
   – Check again: rows==0 and cols!=other.cols? 0==0 True but 1!=1 False ⇒ skip this branch.
   – Check cols match: 1==1 ⇒ OK.
   – A = A₀.copy(): yields a fresh 0×1 matrix with _smat={ }.
   – other is not a SparseMatrix, so we go to the “dense” branch.  In principle we would walk through other._mat and insert any non-zero entries. Here other._mat is null/empty ⇒ no entries get inserted.
   – Finally A.rows += other.rows ⇒ A.rows = 0 + 2 = 2.

So the result is a 2×1 sparse matrix with no stored (i,j)→v entries, i.e. `_smat` remains {}.
