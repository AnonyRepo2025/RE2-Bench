[THOUGHT]
We call answer with self.nums = [1,1,1,1] and expression = "1+1+1+2".

1. expression != 'pass', so we build statistic by scanning each character:
   - '1' → digit 1 is in self.nums → statistic['1'] = 1
   - next '+' → skip
   - '1' → statistic['1'] = 2
   - '+' → skip
   - '1' → statistic['1'] = 3
   - '+' → skip
   - '2' → digit 2 not in self.nums → skip
   Final statistic = {'1': 3}

2. nums_used = {'1': 3}.

3. Iterate over each num in self.nums (four 1's):
   - 1st 1: nums_used['1']=3 > 0 → decrement to 2
   - 2nd 1: nums_used['1']=2 > 0 → decrement to 1
   - 3rd 1: nums_used['1']=1 > 0 → decrement to 0
   - 4th 1: nums_used['1']=0 is not > 0 → fails the check → return False immediately.

Because not all four `1` cards are used in the expression, answer returns False without evaluating the arithmetic.
