[THOUGHT]
We start with:
 self.stack = ['[']
 self.expr = "[(){}"
 left_brackets = ['(', '{', '[']
 right_brackets = [')', '}', ']']

1. clear_expr filters expr to only bracket characters. "[(){}" contains only brackets, so expr remains "[(){}".

2. Iterate over each character in expr:
   - Brkt = '['  
     '[' is a left bracket → push onto stack.  
     stack becomes ['[', '[']  
   - Brkt = '('  
     '(' is a left bracket → push.  
     stack becomes ['[', '[', '(']  
   - Brkt = ')'  
     ')' is a right bracket → pop top of stack: '('  
     Matching '(' with ')' is correct → continue.  
     stack now ['[', '[']  
   - Brkt = '{'  
     '{' is a left bracket → push.  
     stack becomes ['[', '[', '{']  
   - Brkt = '}'  
     '}' is a right bracket → pop top: '{'  
     Matching '{' with '}' is correct → continue.  
     stack now ['[', '[']

3. After processing all brackets, stack is ['[', '['], which is not empty.

Since there are unmatched left brackets remaining, check_balanced_brackets returns False.
