[THOUGHT]
We need to simulate OneHotEncoder.transform on X = [[4, 1, 1]] with the given encoder state.

1. transform(X) calls _transform_selected → ultimately calls self._transform(X) because categorical_features="all".

2. In _transform:
   - X = check_array(X, dtype=int) → X becomes array([[4,1,1]]) of shape (1,3).
   - n_samples=1, n_features=3.
   - feature_indices_ = [0,2,5,9] so indices[:-1] = [0,2,5].
   - n_values_ = [2,3,4]. We compute mask = (X < n_values_):
       X[0,0]=4 < 2 → False  
       X[0,1]=1 < 3 → True  
       X[0,2]=1 < 4 → True  
     mask = [False, True, True].
   - handle_unknown="ignore", so we drop the first feature (value 4) rather than raising.
   - Compute shifted indices: (X + indices[:-1]).ravel() = [4+0, 1+2, 1+5] = [4,3,6].
   - Apply mask → column_indices = [3,6][mask] = [3,6][1,2] but since mask is [F,T,T], actually → [3,6] filtered to [3,6] and then mask gives [3,6][T,T] = [3,6]? No: 
       Starting from [4,3,6], mask over that gives [3,6].
   - row_indices = repeat([0], 3) = [0,0,0] → apply mask → [0,0].
   - data = [1.0, 1.0].
   - Build a COO matrix of shape (1,9) with entries (0,3)=1 and (0,6)=1. Convert to CSR.

3. Since n_values="auto", we then select only active_features_ = [0,1,2,4,6,7,8], so we take columns 0,1,2,4,6,7,8 of the 1×9 matrix, yielding a 1×7 matrix.
   - Of the two nonzero entries, (0,3)=1 is dropped (3 not in active_features_), (0,6)=1 is kept; in the new 7-column matrix its column index is the position of 6 in active_features_, namely index 4.
   - So the final CSR matrix has shape (1,7), data=[1.0], indices=[4], indptr=[0,1].

Since sparse=True, transform returns this CSR matrix.

Representing the CSR matrix in JSON via its components:

{
  "data": [1.0],
  "indices": [4],
  "indptr": [0, 1],
  "shape": [1, 7]
