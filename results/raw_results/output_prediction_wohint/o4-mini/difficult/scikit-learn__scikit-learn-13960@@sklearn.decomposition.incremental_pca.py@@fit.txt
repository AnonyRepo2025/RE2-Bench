[THOUGHT]  
We call fit(X) with self.batch_size set to the string "38". In fit:  
- X is converted to a NumPy array of shape (n_samples, 3).  
- batch_size_ is set to self.batch_size, i.e. the string "38".  
- Then we enter the loop  
    for batch in gen_batches(n_samples, self.batch_size_, min_batch_size=0):  
  which calls gen_batches(n, batch_size="38", â€¦).  
- Inside gen_batches it does `n // batch_size`, i.e. an integer divided by a string, which raises  
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for //: 'int' and 'str'  
Therefore fit fails immediately with that TypeError.
