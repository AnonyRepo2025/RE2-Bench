[THOUGHT]
We call instance.delete() with:
- self._state.db = "default"
- self.id = 99998 → self.pk (via the pk property) is 99998, not None.

Step 1: in Model.delete:
  using = using or router.db_for_write(self.__class__, instance=self)
Since using is None, we call router.db_for_write(...). The default router will return instance._state.db ("default") if none of the custom routers claim the model. So using = "default".

Step 2: collector = Collector(using="default", origin=self)
  This initializes the deletion Collector, with empty data structures.

Step 3: collector.collect([self], keep_parents=False)
  - can_fast_delete([self]) → False (we’re passing a list, not a QuerySet or model class, and there are no fast‐delete conditions).
  - add([self], ...) adds the instance to collector.data.
  - There are no parent pointers or related objects to collect, so collect() returns.

Step 4: return collector.delete()
  In Django, Collector.delete() executes the SQL DELETE and returns a tuple:
    (number_of_objects_deleted, { "app_label.ModelName": count, ... })
  Here we’re deleting exactly one object (our instance), and there are no cascaded deletes of related models.  The key in the dict is formed as "<app_label>.<ModelName>", where app_label and ModelName come from the instance’s _meta.  Since we haven’t been given a real app_label, we’ll denote it generically.

Thus the return value is a 2-tuple: 
  (1, { "<app_label>.Model": 1 })

In JSON form we can represent it as:
