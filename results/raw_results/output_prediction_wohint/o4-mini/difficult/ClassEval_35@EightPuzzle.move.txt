[THOUGHT]
1. The blank (0) is located at position (i, j) = (1, 2) in the given state.
2. We make a deep copy of the state into `new_state`.
3. The direction is "left", so we swap the blank at (1, 2) with the tile to its left at (1, 1).
   - Before swap, row 1 is [7, 8, 0].
   - Swapping positions 1 and 2 yields [7, 0, 8].
4. The resulting state is:
   [
     [1, 6, 2],
     [7, 0, 8],
     [4, 5, 3]
   ]
