[THOUGHT]
We call simplify(expr="50").

1. In simplify, first line: expr = sympify(expr). Since expr is the string "50", sympify parses it into the Sympy Integer 50.

2. Next, the code tries:
   try:
       return expr._eval_simplify(...)
   except AttributeError:
       pass
   Does Integer(50) have a custom `_eval_simplify`? It does not override that method, so calling `_eval_simplify` will raise `AttributeError`, falling through to the except.

3. They then do:
   original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)
   For a positive integer, `signsimp(50)` just returns 50.

4. Next:
   if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:
       return expr
   Here expr is an instance of Basic (Integer is subclass of Basic), but `expr.args` is empty (`[]`). So `not expr.args` is True, so they immediately return expr, which is the Sympy Integer 50.

So the final return value of simplify("50") is the Sympy Integer 50. In JSON this is represented as the number 50.
