[THOUGHT]
We have two separate calls to reason about.

1) mktemp:
- self._basetemp is None, but self._given_basetemp is the string "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0".  The converter on _given_basetemp turns it into a Path of the absolute string, so getbasetemp() will return Path("/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0").
- mktemp with numbered=True calls make_numbered_dir(root=that path, prefix="world").
- make_numbered_dir looks at existing suffixes under that directory of the form "world{n}", parses numbers, finds max (none present → max_existing = -1), so new_number = 0.
- It mkdirs "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world0", symlinks "worldcurrent" → world0 (ignored here), and returns the new Path.
- mktemp returns that Path.

So the output JSON should contain the path string "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world0".

2) ContinuousBase._setup:
- The method expects self to be a Scale object with various methods and attributes (_get_transform, _get_scale, tick(), label(), etc.) and prop to be a seaborn Property with .normed and .get_mapping.
- In the provided input, self.trans is just the string "log", _tick_params is None, etc., and prop is a bare dict {"variable": "y"}.
- As soon as the code tries to read prop.normed, Python will attempt to get attr "normed" on a dict, which raises AttributeError.
- Therefore, _setup will not return normally but will raise an AttributeError indicating 'dict' object has no attribute 'normed'.
