[THOUGHT]
The `fit` method always returns `self`, i.e. the same estimator object (now with its attributes updated to the result of the optimization). We cannot hand‚Äêcompute the full optimized coefficients, intercept, scale, etc., from the provided large random dataset. Therefore the output of the call is simply the estimator instance itself.
