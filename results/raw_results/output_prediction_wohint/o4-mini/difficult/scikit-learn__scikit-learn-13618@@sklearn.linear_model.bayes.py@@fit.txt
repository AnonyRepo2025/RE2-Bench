[THOUGHT]
1. The `fit` method of `BayesianRidge` always returns `self` (the fitted estimator instance), after fitting has completed.
2. Without actually performing all the linear-algebra computations on the 50Ã—5 matrix and target vector, we cannot supply the exact numerical values of `coef_`, `intercept_`, `alpha_`, `lambda_`, `sigma_`, etc., by hand.
3. Therefore the only predictable part of the output is that it returns the fitted estimator object itself.
