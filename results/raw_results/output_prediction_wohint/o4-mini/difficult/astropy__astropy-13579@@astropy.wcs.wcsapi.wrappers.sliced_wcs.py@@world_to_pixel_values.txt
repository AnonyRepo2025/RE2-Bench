[THOUGHT]
We are calling SlicedLowLevelWCS.world_to_pixel_values with no arguments (so world_arrays = ()). Internally it does:

1. Compute `sliced_out_world_coords = self._pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep))`.
   - Here `self._pixel_keep` is given as “[0 1]”, which we interpret as an array-like of length 2, so `*[0]*2` → two zeros → calls `_pixel_to_world_values_all(0, 0)`.
2. Entering `_pixel_to_world_values_all`, it tries to build `pixel_arrays_new` by looping over `ipix` in `range(self._wcs.pixel_n_dim)`.
   - `self._wcs.pixel_n_dim` is 3, so `ipix = 0, 1, 2`.
3. On the first iteration (`ipix = 0`), it evaluates
      isinstance(self._slices_pixel[0], numbers.Integral)
   but `self._slices_pixel` was given as `null` (`None`), so indexing into it raises
      TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable

Thus the method does not complete—it immediately fails when trying to subscript `self._slices_pixel`.

So the call to `world_to_pixel_values()` raises a TypeError.
