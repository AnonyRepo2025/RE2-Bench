[THOUGHT]
1. process_csv_data is called with N=1 and save_file_name="read_test.csv".
2. It calls read_csv("read_test.csv"), which:
   - Opens the file, reads the first row as `title` (a list of header strings).
   - Reads the remaining rows into `data` (a list of lists of strings).
3. It builds `column_data` by taking the element at index 1 from each row in `data` and converting each to uppercase.
4. It constructs `new_data = [title, column_data]`.
5. It calls write_csv(new_data, "read_test_process.csv"):
   - Opens (or creates) the file and writes the two rows.
   - On success, write_csv returns 1.
6. process_csv_data then returns that same value, 1.

Assuming "read_test.csv" exists and is correctly formatted, no exceptions occur and the method returns 1.
