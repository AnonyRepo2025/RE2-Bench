[THOUGHT]
We call `_finger(eq)` where `eq._argset` is the frozenset `{y & ~x, x & ~y}`.

1. Compute `eq.free_symbols`.  
   - `eq.args` will be the two sub‐expressions `(x & ~y)` and `(y & ~x)` in some deterministic order (by default sorting, it will be `(x & ~y)` then `(y & ~x)`).
   - Each of these has free symbols `{x, y}`.  
   - So `f = eq.free_symbols = {x, y}`.

2. Initialize the dictionary `d` by zipping `f` with two fresh `[0,0,0,0,0]` lists.  Assuming iteration order `x, y`, we get:  
   ```
   d = {
     x: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     y: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   }
   ```

3. Iterate over each sub‐expression `a` in `eq.args`:

   a) First `a = x & ~y`:  
      - Not a symbol, not a bare Not, so go to the `else` branch.  
      - Compute `o = len(a.args) + number_of_Nots_in(a.args) = 2 + 1 = 3`  
        (the arguments are `x` and `~y`, one of them is a Not).  
      - For each `ai` in `a.args`:  
         - `ai = x` is a Symbol →  
            `d[x][2] += 1`  and  `d[x][4] += o = 3`.  
         - `ai = ~y` is a Not →  
            `d[y][3] += 1`.  
      After this step:  
      ```
      d[x] = [0,0,1,0,3]
      d[y] = [0,0,0,1,0]
      ```

   b) Second `a = y & ~x`: (same pattern)  
      - `o = 2 + 1 = 3`  
      - `ai = y` →  `d[y][2] += 1`,  `d[y][4] += 3`  
      - `ai = ~x` →  `d[x][3] += 1`  
      After this:  
      ```
      d[x] = [0,0,1,1,3]
      d[y] = [0,0,1,1,3]
      ```

4. Now `d` maps both `x` and `y` to the same “fingerprint” vector `(0,0,1,1,3)`.

5. Build `inv`: a `defaultdict(list)`.  We iterate `d.items()` in a sorted order of the keys (`x` before `y`), and append each symbol into `inv[(0,0,1,1,3)]`.

   Final result is equivalent to:
   ```
   defaultdict(list, {
     (0, 0, 1, 1, 3): [x, y]
   })
   ```
