[THOUGHT]
We call polytope_integrate(poly={}, expr="x**2 + x*y + y**2", clockwise=False, max_degree=None).

1. clockwise is False, so we skip that branch.
2. `isinstance(poly, Polygon)` is False since poly is a dict.
3. The next branch is `elif len(poly[0]) == 2:`. This attempts to evaluate `poly[0]`.
4. But `poly` is a plain dict, so `poly[0]` raises a KeyError (there is no key `0`).
5. No except‚Äêblock catches this, so the KeyError propagates out of the function.

Therefore, the call does not return a value but raises a KeyError with key `0`.
