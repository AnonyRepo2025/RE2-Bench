[THOUGHT]
call_command("transaction", stdout={}, no_color=True) proceeds as follows:

1. command_name is a string, not a BaseCommand instance.
2. It calls get_commands() to look up the mapping of available commands. Since settings are not configured, get_commands() returns only the core Django‚Äêprovided commands (none named "transaction").
3. Attempting to do app_name = get_commands()["transaction"] raises KeyError.
4. That KeyError is caught, and call_command raises CommandError("Unknown command: 'transaction'").

Thus the function does not return normally but raises a CommandError with that message.
