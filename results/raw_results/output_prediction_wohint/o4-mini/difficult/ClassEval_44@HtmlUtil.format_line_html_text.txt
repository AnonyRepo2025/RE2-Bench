[THOUGHT]
1. Input HTML is "<ul><li>Item 1</li></ul>".
2. No `<pre>` or `<blockquote>` tags, so code tags loop does nothing.
3. We find one `<ul>`; inside it one `<li>` with text "Item 1".
4. For the `<li>`, since the last character "1" is not punctuation, we enter the else branch and set
   li_item.string = "[-]Item 1.".
5. There are no `<p>` tags, so that loop does nothing.
6. `soup.get_text()` now returns "[-]Item 1.", and `decode_htmlentities` leaves it unchanged.
7. No line feeds to normalize, so the final returned string is "[-]Item 1.".

Therefore, the method returns "[-]Item 1.".
