[THOUGHT]
1. `solve` initializes  
   open_list = [(initial_state, [])] = [([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]], [])]  
   closed_list = []  

2. Enter the while loop since open_list is not empty.  
   Pop the first element:  
   current_state = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]]  
   path = []  
   closed_list becomes [[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]]]  

3. Check if current_state == goal_state. They are identical, so the method returns the current path, which is the empty list `[]`.
