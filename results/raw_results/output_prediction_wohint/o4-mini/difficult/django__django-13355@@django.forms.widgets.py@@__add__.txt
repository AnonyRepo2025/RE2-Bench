[THOUGHT]
We call self.__add__(other) where both self._css_lists and other._css_lists are None (same for _js_lists).

1. Enter __add__:  
   combined = Media()  
   – In Media.__init__, media=None so css={}, js=[].  
   – Sets combined._css_lists = [css] → [{}]  
   – Sets combined._js_lists = [js] → [[]]

2. Next line in __add__:  
   combined._css_lists = self._css_lists[:]  
   But self._css_lists is None, so doing None[:] raises a TypeError:  
   "'NoneType' object is not subscriptable"

Thus the method raises a TypeError at that point and does not return a Media object.
