[THOUGHT]
We call `_construct_simple(coeffs=None, opt={})`.

1. The code begins by initializing flags and `float_numbers = []`.
2. Next it tries to evaluate `if opt.extension is True:`. Here `opt` is a plain Python dict, which does not have an `extension` attribute.
3. Attempting `opt.extension` therefore immediately raises an `AttributeError` before any further logic or iteration.
4. No return value is produced; the call fails with that exception.
