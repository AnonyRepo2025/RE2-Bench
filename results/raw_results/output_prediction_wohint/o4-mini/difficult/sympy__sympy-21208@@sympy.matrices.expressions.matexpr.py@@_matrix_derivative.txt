[THOUGHT]
We want to run

    _matrix_derivative(expr, x)

with expr a 2×2 matrix and x a symbol.  The code does:

1.  lines = expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)  
    From Sympy’s Expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines this returns a single
    _LeftRightArgs object whose “higher” field is expr._eval_derivative(x).

2.  parts = [ i.build() for i in lines ]  
    Each build() call returns a small list of factors (in fact just the one
    matrix factor, since the left/right unit factors collapse)  
    So parts  == [ [ expr._eval_derivative(x) ] ]

3.  convert_array_to_matrix does nothing here (it just wraps the matrix back).

4.  We compute rank = sum of dimensions ≠1 over all the shapes in parts[0].  
    That is the 2×2 matrix → rank = 2.

5.  Since rank ≤ 2, we take the “Add” branch:

       return Add.fromiter([ contract_one_dims(factors) for factors in parts ])

   But for a single list of length 1, contract_one_dims just returns that one
   factor, i.e. expr._eval_derivative(x).

6.  Hence the final result is exactly expr._eval_derivative(x), which is what
    MatrixCalculus._eval_derivative produces:

       expr.applyfunc(lambda entry: entry.diff(x))

So _matrix_derivative returns the 2×2 matrix whose (i,j)‐entry is
Derivative(expr[i,j], x).

In other words:

    Matrix([[Derivative(expr[0,0],x), Derivative(expr[0,1],x)],
            [Derivative(expr[1,0],x), Derivative(expr[1,1],x)]])

Since we started from an abstract 2×2 matrix “expr” with unspecified entries,
that is the final form of the answer.
