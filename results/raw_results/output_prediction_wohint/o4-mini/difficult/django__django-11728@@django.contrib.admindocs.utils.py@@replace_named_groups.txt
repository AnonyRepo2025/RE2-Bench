[THOUGHT]
1. The function `replace_named_groups` looks for substrings matching the pattern `(?P<name>…)` and replaces the whole group (including its regex) with just `<name>`.
2. The input string is `"admin/password_change/done/"`, which contains no parentheses at all—let alone any named‐group syntax `(?P<…>)`.
3. Therefore `named_group_matcher.finditer(pattern)` yields no matches, `named_group_indices` is empty, and the loop that does the replacements never runs.
4. The function returns the original `pattern` unchanged.
