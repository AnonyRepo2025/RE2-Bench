It looks like you’ve pasted two different puzzles back‐to‐back:

1. Predicting the output of `mktemp` given a certain `TempPathFactory` state (which you’ve already worked through).  
2. Predicting the output of a nested `repl` function inside the `besselsimp` machinery—however, you haven’t actually shown a call to that `repl`, nor specified which of the three different `repl` definitions you want to exercise or what arguments you’d pass to it.

Could you please clarify exactly which function you want to run in the second part, and with what arguments? For example:

- Which `repl` (the one returned by `replacer`, `torewrite`, or `tominus`)?  
- What are the arguments you intend to pass (e.g. values for `nu` and `z`)?  

Once I have that, I can simulate it step by step.
