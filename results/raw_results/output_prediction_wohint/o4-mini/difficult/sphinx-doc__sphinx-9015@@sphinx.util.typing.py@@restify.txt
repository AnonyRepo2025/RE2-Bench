[THOUGHT]
We call restify(cls) where cls is a dict instance with only a `__module__` key in its dict, but as an instance it inherits attributes from its class.

1. cls is not None and not Ellipsis.
2. cls (a dict) is not in INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES.
3. inspect.isNewType(cls) → safe_getattr(cls, '__module__') returns 'builtins', __qualname__ is 'dict' → not a NewType.
4. types_Union and isinstance(cls, types_Union) → False.
5. cls.__module__ resolves via instance lookup to dict.__module__ which is 'builtins', so this branch matches.
6. Return ':class:`%s`' % cls.__name__; cls.__name__ resolves to dict.__name__ → 'dict'.

Hence the result is the string ":class:`dict`".
