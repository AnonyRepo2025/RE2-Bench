[THOUGHT]
1. mktemp is called with basename="world" and numbered=True (default).  
2. Since numbered=True, mktemp does `make_numbered_dir(root=self.getbasetemp(), prefix="world")`.  
3. getbasetemp sees `_basetemp` is None but `_given_basetemp` is set to "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0". It converts that to a Path, ensures the directory is reset, resolves it, stores it in `_basetemp`, and returns it.  
4. In make_numbered_dir:
   - It looks for existing directories in the root with names starting with "world" and extracts their numeric suffixes. There are none, so `max_existing = -1`.
   - It sets `new_number = max_existing + 1 = 0`.
   - It constructs `new_path = root / "world0"`, i.e. "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world0" and makes that directory.  
   - It then creates/updates a symlink "worldcurrent" â†’ "world0", and returns the Path for "world0".  
5. mktemp returns this Path object.
