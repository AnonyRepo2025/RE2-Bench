[THOUGHT]
We call periodicity(f, symbol, check=False) with f = csc(2*x) - sec(x) and symbol = x.

1. simplify(csc(2*x) - sec(x)) leaves it unchanged.
2. f.is_Add is True. as_independent(x) finds no x-independent constant term, so k = 0, g = f.
3. It then calls the helper `_periodicity` on the summand arguments: [csc(2*x), -sec(x)].
4. The period of csc(2*x) is π (since csc has base period 2π, and the argument 2*x halves it).
5. The period of -sec(x) is the same as sec(x), namely 2π.
6. The overall period is the least common multiple of π and 2π, which is 2π.
7. Since check=False, periodicity returns the period as a SymPy expression 2*pi.
