[THOUGHT]
We call `_set_params(self, attr="_transformers", n_jobs=2)` on an object whose attributes are:

  transformers = None  
  remainder = "drop"  
  n_jobs = 1  
  transformer_weights = None  

1.  The first `if attr in params` tests whether `"_transformers"` is a key in `{"n_jobs": 2}`. It is not, so we skip that block.

2.  We do `items = getattr(self, "_transformers")`.  
    - In a real `ColumnTransformer`, `_transformers` is a property that returns a list of `(name, transformer)` pairs.  
    - Here `self.transformers` is `None`, so that list would be empty (`[]`).  
    - Therefore `items = []`.

3.  We initialize `names = []`. Since `items` is empty, we leave `names` as `[]`.

4.  We loop over the remaining keys in `params`, i.e. just `"n_jobs"`.  
    - `"__"` is not in `"n_jobs"`, but `"n_jobs"` is not in `names` (which is empty), so we do not call `_replace_estimator` and do not pop anything from `params`.

5.  We then call `super(...).set_params(**params)`, i.e. `BaseEstimator.set_params(n_jobs=2)`.  
    - This sets `self.n_jobs = 2`.

6.  We return `self`, now mutated.

No other attributes are changed.

Hence the returned object has the same attributes except `n_jobs` has been updated to `2`.
