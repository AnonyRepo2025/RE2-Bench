[THOUGHT]
We call encode_cf_datetime(dates, units, calendar) with

 dates = a numpy.datetime64 scalar equal to "2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000"
 units = "days since 2000-01-01"
 calendar = "gregorian"

1. Inside the function, dates = np.asarray(dates) → array of dtype datetime64[ns] containing the single date 2000-01-11.
2. units is not None, so we clean it via _cleanup_netcdf_time_units:
   - unpack to delta = "days", ref_date = "2000-01-01"
   - format_timestamp("2000-01-01") → "2000-01-01"
   - reassemble to "days since 2000-01-01" (unchanged).
3. calendar is given as "gregorian" (a standard calendar).
4. In the try block:
   - _is_standard_calendar("gregorian") is True, dtype.kind is 'm' not 'O', so we do not force the cftime path.
   - Assert dates.dtype is datetime64[ns] → passes.
   - Convert delta="days" to numpy unit 'D', then to a nanosecond timedelta: time_delta = 1 day in nanoseconds (86400×10^9 ns).
   - ref_date = pd.Timestamp("2000-01-01")
   - dates_as_index = DatetimeIndex(["2000-01-11"])
   - time_deltas = dates_as_index − ref_date = 10 days
   - Since 10 days is an integer multiple of 1 day, we do integer-division: num = 10
   - Reshape back to the original shape → a scalar array containing 10.
5. No exception was raised, so we proceed to cast_to_int_if_safe, which leaves num as a numpy int64 10.
6. The function returns the tuple (num, units, calendar) i.e. (10, "days since 2000-01-01", "gregorian").

Therefore the output is:

[OUTPUT]
```
{
  "num": 10,
  "units": "days since 2000-01-01",
  "calendar": "gregorian"
}
```
