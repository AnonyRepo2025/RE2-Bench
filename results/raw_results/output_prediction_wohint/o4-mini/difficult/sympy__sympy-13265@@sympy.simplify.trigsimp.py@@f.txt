[THOUGHT]
We are calling the inner function f on rv = exp(2*I*x) + 1.

The code for f is:

    def f(rv):
        if not rv.is_Mul:
            return rv
        â€¦  # only transforms Mul nodes

Here rv is an Add (a sum), not a Mul, so rv.is_Mul is False and f immediately returns rv unchanged.

Therefore the output of f is the same expression: exp(2*I*x) + 1.

[OUTPUT]
{
  "return_value": "exp(2*I*x) + 1"
}
