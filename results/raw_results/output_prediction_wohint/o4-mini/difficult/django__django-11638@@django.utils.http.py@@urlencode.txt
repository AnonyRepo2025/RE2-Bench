[THOUGHT]
1. The input `query` is a list of 2-tuples, so it is not a `MultiValueDict` and does not have an `.items()` method, so we fall through to treating it directly as an iterable of key/value pairs.
2. `doseq` is `False`, so in the loop `elif not doseq or isinstance(value, (str, bytes))` is true, and we set `query_val = value`. The values remain the integers `1`, `2`, and `3`.
3. We build `query_params = [("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)]`.
4. We call `original_urlencode(query_params, doseq=False)`, which stringifies each value and joins with `&`, yielding the string `"a=1&b=2&c=3"`.
5. That string is returned by `urlencode`.

"a=1&b=2&c=3"
