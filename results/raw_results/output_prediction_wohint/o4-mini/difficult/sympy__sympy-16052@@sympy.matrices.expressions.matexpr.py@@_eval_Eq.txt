[THOUGHT]
We call MatrixExpr._eval_Eq(self, other) with both `self` and `other` as plain dicts ({}), not MatrixExpr instances.

1. The first line checks `isinstance(other, MatrixExpr)`. Here `other` is `{}`, so this is False.
2. Because that check fails, the method immediately returns False.

No further code is executed.
