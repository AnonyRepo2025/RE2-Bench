[THOUGHT]
We call `_BaseVoting.fit(self, X, y, sample_weight=None)` with
  self.estimators = None,
  self.weights = None,
  self.n_jobs   = None.

Step by step:

1. The method starts:
   names, clfs = self._validate_estimators()

2. In the sklearn implementation, `_validate_estimators` does something like:
     names, estimators = zip(*self.estimators)
   It expects `self.estimators` to be an iterable of (name, estimator) pairs.

3. Here `self.estimators` is `None`, so attempting to unpack it:
     zip(*self.estimators)
   actually is equivalent to:
     zip(*None)
   which immediately raises
     TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

No code in `fit` catches this error, so the call fails right there.

Therefore the output of `fit` is an exception.
