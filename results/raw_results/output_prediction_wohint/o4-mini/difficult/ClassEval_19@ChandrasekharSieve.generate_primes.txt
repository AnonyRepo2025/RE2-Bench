[THOUGHT]
1. The method sees that self.n = 15, which is ≥ 2, so it proceeds.
2. It initializes a list `sieve` of length 16 (indexes 0 through 15) all set to True, then sets sieve[0] and sieve[1] to False.
3. It starts with p = 2. Since 2*2 = 4 ≤ 15 and sieve[2] is True, it marks multiples of 2 ≥ 4 as False: indexes 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.
4. Increments p to 3. Since 3*3 = 9 ≤ 15 and sieve[3] is True, it marks multiples of 3 ≥ 9 as False: indexes 9, 12 (already False), 15.
5. Increments p to 4. Now 4*4 = 16 > 15, so the marking loop ends.
6. It collects all indexes i from 2 to 15 where sieve[i] is still True. These are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.
7. Returns the list [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13].
