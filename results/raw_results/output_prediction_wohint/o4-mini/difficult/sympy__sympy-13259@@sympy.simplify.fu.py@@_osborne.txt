[THOUGHT]
The function `_osborne` does a bottom-up traversal of the expression `e` and, whenever it sees a Sympy HyperbolicFunction, replaces it according to these rules (for `sinh` it returns `I*sin(a)`).

We call `_osborne` on the expression 2*sinh(2) with a multiplier `d`. Although the signature requires both `e` and `d`, the test input only gives `e = 2*sinh(2)`.  By convention in this transformation `d` is the real multiplier applied to the argument; if not specified we take `d = 1`.

So:
- Walk the tree: the top node is `Mul(2, sinh(2))`.
- Recurse into the `sinh(2)` node, which is a HyperbolicFunction.
- For `sinh`, the code does `return I * sin(a)` with `a = 2 * d = 2*1 = 2`.
- So `sinh(2)` becomes `I*sin(2)`.
- Reassemble the multiplication: `2 * (I*sin(2))` â†’ `2*I*sin(2)`.

Hence the returned Sympy expression is `2*I*sin(2)`.
