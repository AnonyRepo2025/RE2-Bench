[THOUGHT]
We have H=1000, W=1000, A=0, B=486.

The code builds a 1000×1000 grid initialized to '0'. Then for each cell (i,j):

- If i < B (i < 486):  
  - Since A=0, the check j < A is always false (j<0 never holds), so we take the else branch and set answer[i][j] = '1'.  
  Thus rows 0 through 485 become all '1's.

- For i ≥ B (i ≥ 486):  
  - We go to the elif j < A check, but again j<0 is false, so we take the else branch and leave answer[i][j] = '0'.  
  Thus rows 486 through 999 remain all '0's.

Therefore the program will print 1000 lines: the first 486 lines are each a string of 1000 '1' characters, and the last 514 lines are each a string of 1000 '0' characters.

[OUTPUT]
(First 486 lines each consisting of 1000 consecutive '1' characters)
(Then 514 lines each consisting of 1000 consecutive '0' characters)
