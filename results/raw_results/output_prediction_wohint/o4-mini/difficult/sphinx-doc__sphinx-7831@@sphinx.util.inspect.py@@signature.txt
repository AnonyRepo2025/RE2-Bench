[THOUGHT]
We call signature(subject) where subject.__signature__ is the string "(arg, kwarg=None)".

1. Inside signature(), `_should_unwrap(subject)` is False (no `__globals__`), so we do:
       signature = inspect.signature(subject, follow_wrapped=False)
2. `inspect.signature` sees a `__signature__` attribute. Normally it only accepts it if it is already an `inspect.Signature` object; a bare string would be rejected and fall back to deriving a signature. But since `subject` is not callable, deriving a signature fails with a ValueError.
3. That ValueError is caught by our `except ValueError` clause, which then retries
       signature = inspect.signature(subject)
   again. The same logic applies â€” nothing is callable, so inspect.signature again raises ValueError.
4. That second ValueError is _not_ caught, so it propagates out of our `signature()` function.

Thus the call to `signature(subject)` does not return a value but raises a ValueError indicating no signature could be found for the (non-callable) object.

We therefore expect a ValueError to be raised.
