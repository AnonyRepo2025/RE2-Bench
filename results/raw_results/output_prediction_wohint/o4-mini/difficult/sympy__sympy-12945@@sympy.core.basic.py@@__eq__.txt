[THOUGHT]
We are calling Basic.__eq__(self, other) with
- self: an object of type Basic (represented here by `{}` in the input, but we treat it as a Basic instance)
- other: the string `"I*x"`

Step by step through __eq__:

1. `if self is other:`  
   - self (Basic) is not the same object as other (a string) → False.

2. `if type(self) is not type(other):`  
   - type(self) is Basic, type(other) is str → they differ.
   - Next special-cases for Pow with exp==1 don’t apply (self is not a Pow; other is not a Pow).

3. Try to sympify `other`:
   - `_sympify("I*x")` → parses the string and returns the Sympy expression I*x.

4. Now `other` is a Sympy Mul object (type `sympy.Mul`), while `self` is still Basic → types still differ.

5. Because types differ after sympification, the method returns False.

Therefore, the result of `__eq__` is False.
