We are running `_nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop` in mode='B' with the given X (4×3) and Y (4×2).  

1. Initialize  
   y_score = first column of Y =  
     [−2.22e-16, 3.33e-16, −3.33e-16, 4.44e-16]ᵀ  
   x_weights_old = 0, ite = 1, X_pinv = Y_pinv = None,  
   eps ≃ 2.22e-16.

2. First loop iteration:  
   – Compute X_pinv = pinv(X).  
   – x_weights = X_pinv @ y_score → a vector ≃ 0 (on the order of 1e-16).  
   – Its norm² < eps, so we do  
       x_weights += eps  → each entry ≃ eps  
       x_weights /= (√(3·eps²) + eps) = eps·(√3+1)  
       → each entry = 1/(√3+1) ≃ 0.3660254038  
   – x_score = X @ x_weights ≃ [0.0525325, –0.0339444, –0.0431787, 0.0246370]ᵀ  
   – Compute Y_pinv = pinv(Y) (via (YᵀY)⁻¹Yᵀ).  
   – y_weights = Y_pinv @ x_score ≃ [3.99e13, –7.94e-2]ᵀ  
   – norm_y_weights=True, so normalize:  
       norm ≃ 3.99e13,  
       y_weights ≃ [1.0, –2e-15]ᵀ  
   – Update y_score = Y @ y_weights/(‖y_weights‖²+eps) ≃ original first column.  
   – Compute x_weights_diff = x_weights – x_weights_old = x_weights – 0  
     ⇒ norm² ≃ 0.402 > tol → continue.  
   – Set x_weights_old = x_weights, ite=2.

3. Second iteration:  
   – x_weights = X_pinv @ y_score → same tiny vector → adjusted to [0.3660254,…]  
   – Difference from x_weights_old is ≃0 → norm² < tol → break.

Return `(x_weights, y_weights, ite)` with  
x_weights ≃ [0.3660254, 0.3660254, 0.3660254]ᵀ  
y_weights ≃ [1.0, –2e-15]ᵀ  
ite = 2
