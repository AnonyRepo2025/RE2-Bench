[THOUGHT]
We call `_mapping_repr(mapping, title, summarizer, expand_option_name)` with:
  mapping = {"foo": "bar"}
  title = "Attributes"
  summarizer = {}   ← a plain dict, not a callable
  expand_option_name = "display_expand_attrs"

1. `_mapping_repr` first sets `col_width = _calculate_col_width(mapping)`.
   - `mapping` is a dict, so iterating its keys gives ["foo"].
   - max_name_length = len("foo") = 3.
   - col_width = max(3, 7) + 6 = 13.
2. `max_rows = OPTIONS['display_max_rows']` (but mapping has length 1, which is ≤ any reasonable default).
3. It checks `_get_boolean_with_default("display_expand_attrs", True)`:
   - OPTIONS["display_expand_attrs"] is presumably "default", so this returns True.
4. Since `mapping` is non‐empty and length ≤ max_rows, it proceeds to build:
     summary = ["Attributes:"] 
     then tries to append `summarizer(k, v, col_width)` for each (k,v) in mapping.
5. But `summarizer` is the dict `{}`, not a function. Attempting `summarizer("foo", "bar", 13)` raises:
     TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable

Hence the call fails with a TypeError before any string can be returned.
