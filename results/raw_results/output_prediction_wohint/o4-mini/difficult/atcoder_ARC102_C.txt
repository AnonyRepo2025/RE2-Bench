We have K=1, N=200000, mod=998244353.

1. X is initialized as a list of length 2*K-1 = 1: X = [0].

2. Compute factorials frac[0..N+K] = frac[0..200001] and their modular inverses invf[0..200001].

3. The main loop is for k in range(2, K+2) = range(2,3), so only k=2.
   - S = 0, sign = 1, l = k//2 = 1.
   - The inner loop is for m in range(min(l+1, N//2+1)) = range(min(2,100001)) = m=0,1.

   For m=0:
   - term = sign * frac[l] * frac[N+K-2*m-1]
          =  1 * frac[1] * frac[200000]
          = frac[200000].
   - multiply by invf[m]*invf[l-m] = invf[0]*invf[1] = 1*1 =1 → term still frac[200000].
   - multiply by invf[N-2*m]*invf[K-1] = invf[200000]*invf[0] = invf[200000]*1.
   - frac[200000]*invf[200000] ≡ 1 mod → term = 1.
   - S = 1, sign = -1.

   For m=1:
   - term = sign * frac[1] * frac[199998]
          = -1 * frac[199998].
   - multiply by invf[1]*invf[0] =1 → term = -frac[199998].
   - mod this → term ≡ 998244353 − frac[199998].
   - multiply by invf[199998]*invf[0]: (998244353 − frac[199998]) * invf[199998]
     ≡ −(frac[199998]*invf[199998]) ≡ −1 ≡ 998244352 mod.
   - S = 1 + 998244352 ≡ 0, sign = 1.

   After the loop, S = 0. Then X[k-2] and X[2*K-k] are both X[0] = S = 0.

4. Finally the code prints each element of X on its own line. There is only X[0] = 0.

Hence the program outputs a single line with “0”.
