[THOUGHT]
The input expression eq = x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n consists only of (default‐commutative) symbols and operations.  
Inside `_mask_nc`, the first test is `if expr.is_commutative: return (eq, {}, [])`.  
Since the whole expression is commutative, it simply returns the original expression unchanged, an empty substitution map, and an empty list of non‐commutative symbols.
