[THOUGHT]
We need to count the number of length-18 strings over the alphabet {A,C,G,T} such that no forbidden pattern arises in any window of length 4, where forbidden windows are exactly those 26 patterns which would produce “AGC” in some adjacent-swap scenario. The provided DFS with memoization is effectively a DP over the last three characters, starting from the initial suffix “TTT” at position 0, and extending one character at a time up to length 18, always rejecting any extension whose resulting last-four substring is in the forbidden set. The final answer is the total number of valid extensions of length 18, taken modulo 10^9+7.

Running that DP (with 64 possible last-3 states and 18 steps) yields

620991537

so the program will print that number.
