[THOUGHT]
We call Function._eval_evalf(self, prec=2).

1. Enter the first try block:
   - It checks `isinstance(self, AppliedUndef)`. We have no indication `self` is an AppliedUndef, so this is False.
   - Next it tries to read `self.func.__name__`. But our `self` has no `func` attribute (only `nargs` is given). Accessing `self.func` raises AttributeError.
2. This AttributeError is caught by the first `except (AttributeError, KeyError)` clause.
3. In that except block it tries:
       return Float(self._imp_(*[i.evalf(prec) for i in self.args]), prec)
   - To build the argument list it does `self.args`. But `self` has no `_args` attribute, and `.args` is a method, so trying to iterate `for i in self.args` will fail (AttributeError or TypeError).
   - Even if that worked, it would then try `self._imp_`, which also doesn’t exist.
   Any of these missing‐attribute or type errors get caught by the inner
   `except (AttributeError, TypeError, ValueError)`, which does a bare `return`.
4. A bare `return` in Python means returning `None`.

Thus the method returns `None`.
