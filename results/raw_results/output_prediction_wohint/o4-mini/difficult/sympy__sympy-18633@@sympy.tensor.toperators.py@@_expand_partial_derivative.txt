[THOUGHT]
We are calling `_expand_partial_derivative(self)` with a `self` that has no `.args` (i.e. `self.args` is the empty tuple).

1. The first line of `_expand_partial_derivative` is:
       args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)
2. It tries to evaluate `self.expr`, which is defined as `self.args[0]`.
3. Since `self.args` is empty, accessing `self.args[0]` raises an IndexError: “tuple index out of range”.
4. Therefore the method never proceeds past that point and immediately errors out.

No other code in the method is reached.
