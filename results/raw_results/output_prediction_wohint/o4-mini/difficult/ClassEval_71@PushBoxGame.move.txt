[THOUGHT]
We start at player_row=1, player_col=2, boxes=[(3,2)], targets=[(3,3)].

Call move('s'):
- new_player_row = 1+1 = 2, new_player_col = 2.
- map[2][2] is 'X' (not a wall), so we can move into it.
- Check if (2,2) is in boxes: boxes contains only (3,2), so no.
- Therefore we just update the player position to (2,2).
- Now call check_win():
  - boxes = [(3,2)], targets = [(3,3)].
  - No box is on the target, so box_on_target_count = 0.
  - target_count = 1, so 0 != 1 â‡’ is_game_over stays False.
  - Return False.
