We need to simulate MatMul.args_cnc(self, **kwargs) with no kwargs. By definition:

  def args_cnc(self, **kwargs):
      coeff, matrices = self.as_coeff_matrices()
      coeff_c, coeff_nc = coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)
      if coeff_c == [1]:
          coeff_c = []
      elif coeff_c == set([1]):
          coeff_c = set()
      return (coeff_c, coeff_nc + matrices)

Since no further information about self is given, the only reasonable “empty” MatMul‐like object would behave as if it had no scalar or matrix factors. In that case:

1. as_coeff_matrices() would return a “scalar” of 1 (the multiplicative identity) and an empty list of matrices.
2. Calling coeff.args_cnc on 1 treats 1 as a purely commutative factor, so it would return coeff_c = [1], coeff_nc = [].
3. The code then notices coeff_c == [1] and replaces it with the empty list [].
4. Finally it returns (coeff_c, coeff_nc + matrices) == ([], [] + []) == ([], []).

Thus the method returns the two‐element tuple ([], []).
