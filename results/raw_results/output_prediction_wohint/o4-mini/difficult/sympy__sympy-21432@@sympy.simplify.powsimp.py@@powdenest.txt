[THOUGHT]
We call powdenest(eq="_x", force=False, polar=False).

1. Since force=False, we skip the first (force) branch.
2. Since polar=False, we skip the polar branch.
3. We reach:
     new = powsimp(sympify(eq))
   – sympify("_x") produces the symbol _x.
   – powsimp applied to a lone symbol returns it unchanged.
4. Next we do:
     return new.xreplace(Transform(_denest_pow, filter=…))
   – new is just the symbol _x, which has no sub‐expressions to replace.
   – xreplace thus leaves it unchanged.
5. The final return value is the Sympy Symbol(_x), which when printed is _x.

Therefore, powdenest("_x") returns _x.
