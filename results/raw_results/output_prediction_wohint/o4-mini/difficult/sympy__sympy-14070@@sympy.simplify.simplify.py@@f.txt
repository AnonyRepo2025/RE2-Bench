We have rv = -log(2) + log(3). Calling logcombine(rv):

1. Split into terms: a₁ = -log(2) (a Mul of −1 and log(2)), a₂ = log(3).

2. For a₁ = −1·log(2):
   - ai = −1 is a negative Rational → we record an “other‐term” factor of −1 and a coefficient +1.
   - ai = log(2) → we collect it as a log term.
   So we record one entry in log1 under key (−1,): (coefs=[1], log=log(2)).

3. For a₂ = log(3):
   - It’s a single log, so we record log1[()] = [ (coefs=[], log=log(3)) ].

4. No higher‐nesting logs to pull out. We then rebuild log1 to map Mul(*key)→combined log:
   - key=(): Mul()=1 → exponent combination gives 3 → log(3, evaluate=False).
   - key=(−1,): Mul(−1)=−1 → exponent combination gives 2 → log(2, evaluate=False).

5. Now log1 = {−1: log(2), 1: log(3)}. We see both k and −k present (k=−1, −k=1), so we combine:
   - num = k = −1, den = −k = 1
   - pop log1[−1]=log(2) and log1[1]=log(3)
   - form num * log( log(2)/log(3) , evaluate=False ) = −1 * log(2/3, evaluate=False)
   - That is −log(2/3).

6. The final result is the single term −log(2/3).

Thus logcombine(-log(2) + log(3)) returns -log(2/3).
