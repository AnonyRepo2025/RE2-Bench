[THOUGHT]
We have two independent calls to predict.

1. mktemp call:
- self._given_basetemp is the string "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0", converted to a Path already by attr converter.
- self._basetemp is None, so getbasetemp() returns the given basetemp path without changing it.
- mktemp with numbered=True calls make_numbered_dir(root=basetemp, prefix="world").
- Inside make_numbered_dir: find existing suffixes under the root with prefix "world" yields no matches, so parse_num yields empty → max_existing = -1 → new_number = 0.
- new_path = root / "world0" = "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world0", directory is created, symlink updated, and new_path returned.
- mktemp returns that Path.

So mktemp output is the Path to ".../world0".

2. RFECV.fit call:
- check_X_y is called with force_all_finite=False, so X containing nan and inf is accepted.
- cv becomes KFold(5), no problems.
- scoring is None, so check_scoring(self.estimator, None) checks if estimator has a .score method. Here estimator is just the dict {"foo_param":0}, which has no .score → check_scoring raises TypeError:
    "If no scoring is specified, the estimator passed should have a 'score' method. The estimator {'foo_param': 0} does not."
- Therefore fit(...) does not return normally but raises that TypeError.
