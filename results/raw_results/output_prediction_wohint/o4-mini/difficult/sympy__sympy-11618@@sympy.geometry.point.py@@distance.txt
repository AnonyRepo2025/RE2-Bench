We need to compute Point.distance(self, p) where p = [6, 3].  The method does:

1. Since `type(p)` (list) is not `type(self)` (Point), enter the first branch.
2. It checks if `len(p) == len(self)`.  
   - `len(p)` is 2.  
   - `len(self)` invokes Point.__len__(), which returns `len(self.args)`.  We assume this Point was constructed with two coordinates (say `(0,0)` if not specified), so that `len(self.args) == 2`.  
   Hence the lengths match.
3. It then returns
     sqrt(sum((a - b)**2 for a, b in zip(self.args, p)))
   If we assume `self.args == (0, 0)`, this is
     sqrt((0–6)**2 + (0–3)**2)
     = sqrt(36 + 9)
     = sqrt(45)
     = 3*sqrt(5).

Thus the method will return the Sympy expression 3*sqrt(5).
