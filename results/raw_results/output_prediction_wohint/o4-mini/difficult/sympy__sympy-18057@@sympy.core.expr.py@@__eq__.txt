[THOUGHT]
First, mktemp:

1. mktemp is called with numbered=True (default) and basename="world".
2. _basetemp is None, but _given_basetemp is set to the Path "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0".  
3. getbasetemp sees _given_basetemp present, so it uses that directory (ensuring it exists/reset), resolves it, stores it in _basetemp, and returns it.
4. make_numbered_dir(root=that directory, prefix="world") runs:
   - find any existing entries named world0, world1, etc.  There are none, so parse_num yields no numbers and max_existing = -1.
   - new_number = max_existing + 1 = 0.
   - new_path = root / "world0" = "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world0".
   - new_path.mkdir() succeeds; a "world0" directory is created.
   - A symlink "worldcurrent" â†’ new_path is updated (but does not affect return value).
   - make_numbered_dir returns the Path for ".../world0".
5. mktemp returns that Path.

So the return value is the Path object pointing to "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_mktemp0/world0".

Second, Expr.__eq__:

1. __eq__ is invoked with self = {} (a plain dict) and other = "picoweber".
2. It first tries `other = _sympify("picoweber")`.  sympify of the string "picoweber" parses it as a Symbol('picoweber'), which is an Expr subclass.
3. It checks `if not isinstance(other, Expr)`: that is False since other is a Symbol.
4. Next it evaluates `if not (self.is_Number and other.is_Number) and type(self) != type(other)`.  
   - It must first read `self.is_Number`.  But self is a dict, which has no attribute is_Number.
   - That lookup raises AttributeError.
5. The method does not catch AttributeError, so the call results in an AttributeError being raised.

Therefore the mktemp call returns the new directory Path, and the __eq__ call raises an AttributeError.
