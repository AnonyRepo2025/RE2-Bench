[THOUGHT]
We call besselsimp on the SymPy expression

    exp(-I*pi*a/2)*besseli(a, 2*sqrt(x))*exp_polar(I*pi/2)

Step through the replacers:

1. The first `.replace(besselj, …)` does nothing (there is no besselj in the expression).

2. The second `.replace(besseli, replacer(besseli, torewrite(besseli, besselj), ifactors))` looks at each `besseli(nu,z)`. Here z = 2*sqrt(x) has no factor of I or exp_polar(±Iπ/2), so the replacer returns the original `besseli(a,2*sqrt(x))` unchanged.

3. The “minusfactors” replacers for besselj and besseli likewise see no match and do nothing.

4. The “expander” replacers only act on arguments when nu is a half‐integer or integer >1 – here nu = a is a general symbol, so no expansion.

No transformation has occurred, so `expr == orig_expr` and the final `if expr!=orig_expr: expr = expr.factor()` is skipped. The return value is exactly the original expression.
