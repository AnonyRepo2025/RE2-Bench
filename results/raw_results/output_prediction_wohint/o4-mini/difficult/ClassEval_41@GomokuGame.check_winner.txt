[THOUGHT]
We scan each cell in row-major order looking for five in a row in any of the four directions.

At row 0, col 0 the cell contains 'O'. We try direction (0,1) (horizontal to the right):

Check positions:
- i=1 → (0,1) is 'O'
- i=2 → (0,2) is 'O'
- i=3 → (0,3) is 'O'
- i=4 → (0,4) is 'O'

We found 5 'O' in a row, so _check_five_in_a_row returns True and check_winner immediately returns 'O'. We never even examine the X five-in-a-row on row 5, since the first winning line found is the O line on row 0.
