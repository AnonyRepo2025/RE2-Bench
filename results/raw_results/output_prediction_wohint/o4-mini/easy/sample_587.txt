[THOUGHT]
We call f(nums, fill) with nums = [0,1,1,2] and fill = "abcca".

The code uses dict.fromkeys(nums, fill), which:
- Iterates over nums in order: 0, then 1, then 1 again, then 2.
- Creates a key for 0 with value "abcca".
- Creates a key for 1 with value "abcca".
- Encounters 1 again, but it already exists, so nothing new.
- Creates a key for 2 with value "abcca".

The resulting dictionary is {0: "abcca", 1: "abcca", 2: "abcca"}.

That dictionary is returned by f, so the output JSON will wrap it under the "output" key.
