[THOUGHT]
We call f(text, chars) with:
- text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"
- chars = "0123456789-"

Step 1: chars is non‐empty, so we execute text = text.rstrip(chars). rstrip(chars) will remove any trailing characters that are in the set { '0','1',…,'9','-' }.

Original text ends "...2.2"
- The last character is '2', which is in chars, so it's stripped.
- Now the new last character is '.', which is not in chars, so stripping stops.

After rstrip, text becomes:
"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."

Step 2: text is not empty (it’s length > 0), so we skip the if text == '' check.

Step 3: return the resulting text.

Final returned value: "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."
