[THOUGHT]
We call f(text) with text = "jcle oq wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds".

1. Initialize ws = 0.
2. Iterate over each character in the string:
   - Count every character where s.isspace() is True.
3. The string has two spaces:
   - One between "jcle" and "oq"
   - One between "oq" and "wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds"
   Thus ws = 2.
4. len(text) counts all characters including spaces:
   - "jcle" = 4
   - first space = 1
   - "oq" = 2
   - second space = 1
   - "wsnibktxpiozyxmopqkfnrfjds" = 26
   Total length = 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 26 = 34.
5. The function returns the tuple (ws, len(text)) = (2, 34).
