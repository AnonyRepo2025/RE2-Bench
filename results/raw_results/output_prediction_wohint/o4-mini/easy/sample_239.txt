[THOUGHT]
We have text = "0 t 1cos " and froms = "st 0\t\n  ".
froms defines the set of characters to strip: {'s','t',' ','0','\t','\n'}.

1. text.lstrip(froms):
   - Original text characters: ['0',' ','t',' ','1','c','o','s',' ']
   - Remove from the left while char ∈ froms:
     index 0: '0' ∈ froms → strip
     index 1: ' ' ∈ froms → strip
     index 2: 't' ∈ froms → strip
     index 3: ' ' ∈ froms → strip
     index 4: '1' ∉ froms → stop
   - Result after lstrip: "1cos "

2. text.rstrip(froms):
   - Current text characters: ['1','c','o','s',' ']
   - Remove from the right while char ∈ froms:
     last index 4: ' ' ∈ froms → strip
     new last index 3: 's' ∈ froms → strip
     new last index 2: 'o' ∉ froms → stop
   - Result after rstrip: "1co"

Return value is "1co".
