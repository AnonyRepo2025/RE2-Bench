[THOUGHT]
We call f(a) with a = [5,5,5,6,4,9].

1. b = a.copy() → b = [5,5,5,6,4,9].
2. Loop for k in range(0, len(a)-1, 2) → range(0,5,2) gives k = 0, 2, 4.

- k = 0:
  b.insert(1, b[0]) → b[0] is 5, insert at index 1:
  b becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9].

- k = 2:
  b.insert(3, b[2]) → current b[2] is 5, insert at index 3:
  b becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9].

- k = 4:
  b.insert(5, b[4]) → current b[4] is 5, insert at index 5:
  b becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9].

3. After the loop, b.append(b[0]) → b[0] is 5, so append 5:
   b becomes [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9, 5].

The function returns this final list.
