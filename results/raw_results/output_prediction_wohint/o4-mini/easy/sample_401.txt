[THOUGHT]
1. The function `f` checks if `suffix` is non-empty and if `text` ends with `suffix`.
2. Here, `suffix` is "example", which is non-empty (truthy).
3. Check `"mathematics".endswith("example")` â†’ False, since "mathematics" does not end with "example".
4. Because the condition fails, the function returns `text` unchanged.
5. The result is "mathematics".
