[THOUGHT]
The method `_eval_is_real` does:
```
if self.args[0].is_real:
    return True
```
We are given a `self` object that has a `nargs` attribute (telling us it expects 1 argument) but no `args` attribute is provided. Accessing `self.args` therefore fails at lookup time. There is no fallback or default, so Python will raise an AttributeError the moment it tries to evaluate `self.args[0]`. No return value is produced because the exception is raised before any `return` is reached.
