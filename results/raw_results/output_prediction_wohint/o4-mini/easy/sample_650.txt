[THOUGHT]
1. The initial `string` is `""` (empty string), and `substring` is `"A"`.
2. The `while` loop condition checks `string.startswith(substring)`.
3. Since `string` is empty, `string.startswith("A")` is `False`.
4. The loop body does not execute even once.
5. The function returns the original `string`, which is still `""`.
