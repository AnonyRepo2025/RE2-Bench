[THOUGHT]
We need to count non‐overlapping occurrences of "hr" in "hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy" by repeatedly finding "hr", chopping the string after it, and counting.

1. length = len("hr") = 2  
2. full = "hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy", count = 0  
3. Find "hr": full.find("hr") → index = 0 (at the very start).  
   - Chop full → full = full[0+2:] = full[2:] = "siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy"  
   - count = 1  
4. Find "hr" in "siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy" → index = 10 (the "hr" at original positions 12–13).  
   - Chop full → full = full[10+2:] = full[12:] = "uejfhbrisvlmmy"  
   - count = 2  
5. Find "hr" in "uejfhbrisvlmmy" → index = -1 (no "hr" remains).  
6. Loop ends, return count = 2.
