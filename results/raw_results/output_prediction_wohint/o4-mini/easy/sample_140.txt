[THOUGHT]
1. The input string is st = "Hi there".
2. Compute st.lower(), which is "hi there".
3. Find the last index of 'i' in "hi there" via rindex('i'):
   - The only 'i' is at position 1, so rindex('i') = 1.
4. Next, compute st.lower().rindex('h', start=1):
   - We look for 'h' in the substring from index 1 to the end.
   - In "hi there", 'h' occurs at indices 0 and 4; only index 4 is â‰¥ 1.
   - Thus rindex('h', 1) = 4.
5. Compare: 4 >= 1 is True.
6. Since the condition is True, the function returns "Hey".
