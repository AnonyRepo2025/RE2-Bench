[THOUGHT]
1. We call f("happy", 0, 3).
2. Compute sublist = text[0:3] = characters at indices 0,1,2 of "happy" â†’ ['h','a','p'] (or string "hap").
3. Check if sublist is empty: it's not, so we proceed.
4. Compute min(sublist): lexicographically smallest character among 'h','a','p' is 'a'.
5. Find sublist.index('a'): in ['h','a','p'], 'a' occurs at index 1.
6. Return 1.
