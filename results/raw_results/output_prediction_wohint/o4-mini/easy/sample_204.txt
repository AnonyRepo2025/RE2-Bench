[THOUGHT]
The function f(name) does the following:
1. name[0] picks the first character of the string `name`.
2. name[1] picks the second character of the string.
   - Then name[1][::-1] reverses that one-character string (no effect).
   - Taking [0] of that still gives the same character.
Given name = "master. ":
- name[0] is 'm'
- name[1] is 'a', reversed is 'a', and [0] is 'a'
So the function returns ['m', 'a'].
