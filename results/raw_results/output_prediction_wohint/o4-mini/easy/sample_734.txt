[THOUGHT]
We start with nums = [5, 3, 3, 7].
The loop is `for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1)`, with len(nums)=4 so range(2, -1, -1) gives i = 2, 1, 0.

1. i = 2 → nums[2] is 3. 3 % 2 != 0, so we do nothing.
   nums remains [5, 3, 3, 7].

2. i = 1 → nums[1] is 3. 3 % 2 != 0, so we do nothing.
   nums remains [5, 3, 3, 7].

3. i = 0 → nums[0] is 5. 5 % 2 != 0, so we do nothing.
   nums remains [5, 3, 3, 7].

No even numbers were found, so no removals occur. The function returns the original list unchanged.
