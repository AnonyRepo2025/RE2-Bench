[THOUGHT]
We check `if employee_id in self.employees`. Currently `self.employees` has only the key "1" (a string). The passed `employee_id` is the integer 1, which is not equal to the string "1", so the key is considered absent. Therefore the code goes into the `else` branch, adds the new entry under key `1`, and returns True.
