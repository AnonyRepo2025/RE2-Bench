[THOUGHT]
We start with txt = "i like you", sep = " ", sep_count = -1, and o = "".

The while loop condition is `sep_count > 0 and txt.count(sep) > 0`. Here sep_count > 0 is `-1 > 0`, which is False. Because the first part of the `and` is False, the loop body never executes.

After skipping the loop, we simply return `o + txt`, which is "" + "i like you" = "i like you".
