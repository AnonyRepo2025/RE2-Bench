[THOUGHT]
1. The input text is "the cow goes moo".  
2. len(text) = 16.  
3. We call text.ljust(len(text) + 1, '#') â†’ text.ljust(17, '#').  
4. ljust pads the string on the right with '#' until its length is 17. Since the original is 16 characters, one '#' is appended.  
5. The result is "the cow goes moo#".

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": "the cow goes moo#"
