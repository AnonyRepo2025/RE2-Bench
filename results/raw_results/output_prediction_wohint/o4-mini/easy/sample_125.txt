[THOUGHT]
1. Initial values:
   - text = `"Leap and the net will appear` (a leading double-quote character followed by the phrase)
   - res = 123

2. The for-loop iterates over c in ['*', '\n', '"']:
   - For c = '*' : no '*' in text → text remains `"Leap and the net will appear`
   - For c = '\n': no newline in text → unchanged
   - For c = '"' : we replace every `"` with `!` + str(res) → `!123`
     Applying this to the leading `"` gives:
     text = `!123Leap and the net will appear`

3. After the loop, we check if text.startswith('!'):
   - It does (`!123…`)
   - Compute len(str(res)) = len("123") = 3
   - Slice off the first 3 characters: text = text[3:]
     - Original text characters by index:
       0:'!' 1:'1' 2:'2' 3:'3' 4:'L'...
     - text[3:] starts at index 3 ('3'): 
       result = `3Leap and the net will appear`

4. Return value is `3Leap and the net will appear`.
