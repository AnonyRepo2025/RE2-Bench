[THOUGHT]
The `read_file_as_json` method will attempt to open the file at path `"test_2.txt"` and parse its contents as JSON. No file contents have been provided, and unless such a file exists in the environment with valid JSON, attempting to open it will raise a FileNotFoundError. There is no exception handling in the method, so the error propagates out of the call.

[OUTPUT]
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'test_2.txt'
