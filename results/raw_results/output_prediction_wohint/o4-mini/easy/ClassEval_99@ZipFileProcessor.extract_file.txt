[THOUGHT]
The method tries:
with ZipFile("example.zip", 'r') as zip_file:
    zip_file.extract("example5.txt", "output_directory")
If "example5.txt" is not in the archive, extract() will raise a KeyError, which is caught by the bare except, and the method returns False. Since we have no indication that example5.txt actually exists in example.zip, we must assume the extraction fails and the method returns False.
