[THOUGHT]
We call __delitem__ with key="first_name" on an empty CamelCaseMap instance.

1. __delitem__ invokes self._convert_key("first_name").
2. _convert_key sees a str and tries to call self._to_camel_case("first_name").
3. But no method named _to_camel_case is defined on CamelCaseMap.
4. This lookup raises an AttributeError before any deletion occurs.

So the operation does not return normally; it raises an AttributeError.

```
{
    "error": "AttributeError: 'CamelCaseMap' object has no attribute '_to_camel_case'"
}
