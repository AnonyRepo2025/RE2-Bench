[THOUGHT]
1. Start with chemicals = ["lsi", "s", "t", "t", "d"], num = 0  
2. fish = chemicals[1:] → fish = ["s", "t", "t", "d"]  
3. chemicals.reverse() → chemicals becomes ["d", "t", "t", "s", "lsi"]  
4. The for loop runs range(0), so no iterations, fish remains unchanged.  
5. chemicals.reverse() again → chemicals returns to ["lsi", "s", "t", "t", "d"]  
6. Return chemicals, which is the original list.
