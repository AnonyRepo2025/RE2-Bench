[THOUGHT]
We call f(num="1", l=3).

1. Initialize t = "".
2. Check while l > len(num): len(num) = 1.
   - Iteration 1: l=3 > 1 is True.
     * t becomes "0".
     * Decrement l to 2.
   - Iteration 2: l=2 > 1 is True.
     * t becomes "00".
     * Decrement l to 1.
   - Iteration 3: l=1 > 1 is False. Exit loop.
3. Return t + num = "00" + "1" = "001".
