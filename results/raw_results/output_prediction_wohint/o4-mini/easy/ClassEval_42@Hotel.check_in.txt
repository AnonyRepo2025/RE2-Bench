[THOUGHT]
1. The method first checks if room_type ("single") is in self.booked_rooms. It is (the key exists), so we do not return False here.
2. Next it checks if name ("guest 1") is in self.booked_rooms["single"]. Currently booked_rooms["single"] is an empty dict, so the name is not present. Therefore the entire inner if block is skipped.
3. There are no further statements or return values at the end of the method, so Python will return None by default.
