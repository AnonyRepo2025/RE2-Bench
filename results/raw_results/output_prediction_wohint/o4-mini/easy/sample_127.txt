[THOUGHT]
The function `f` does the following:
1. Calls `text.splitlines()`, which splits the string at line boundaries (`\n`) and returns a list of the resulting lines, without the newline characters.
2. Returns the length of that list.

Given text = "145\n\n12fjkjg":
- The first `\n` splits "145" and the next empty segment.
- The second `\n` creates a blank line between the two newline characters.
- After that comes "12fjkjg" with no trailing newline.

So `text.splitlines()` returns ["145", "", "12fjkjg"], which has length 3.
