[THOUGHT]
1. Call f with text = "00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110".
2. field = text.replace(' ', '') removes all spaces:
   field = "0000000000000000011011000110010101101110"
3. g = text.replace('0', ' ') replaces every '0' in the original text with a space, producing a string of spaces and the original spaces (unused in return).
4. text = text.replace('1', 'i') replaces every '1' with 'i', leaving '0's and spaces intact:
   - "00000000" -> "00000000"
   - "01101100" -> "0ii0ii00"
   - "01100101" -> "0ii00i0i"
   - "01101110" -> "0ii0iii0"
   Reassembling with spaces:
   text = "00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0i 0ii0iii0"
5. Return that transformed text.
