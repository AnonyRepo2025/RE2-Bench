[THOUGHT]
1. An `ExcelProcessor` instance is created; `__init__` does nothing, so `self` has no relevant state.
2. `write_excel` is called with `data` (a list of 4 rows) and `file_name` `"test_data_process.xlsx"`.
3. Inside `write_excel`:
   - A new workbook is created.
   - We get the active sheet.
   - We loop over each row in `data` and call `sheet.append(row)`. All rows (including headers and numeric values) are appended without issue.
   - `workbook.save(file_name)` writes the file to disk.
   - `workbook.close()` closes the file.
   - No exceptions are raised, so the method returns 1.
4. Therefore, the output is 1.
