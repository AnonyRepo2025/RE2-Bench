[THOUGHT]
We simulate f(s1, s2) with s1="xinyyexyxx", s2="xx":

1. Initialize position = 1, count = 0.
2. Loop condition: position > 0 (1 > 0) is True.
   - position = s1.find("xx", 1). Scanning from index 1, the substring "xx" is found at index 8.
   - Update count: count = 1.
   - Increment position: position = 8 + 1 = 9.
3. Loop condition: position > 0 (9 > 0) is True.
   - position = s1.find("xx", 9). Scanning from index 9, there is no room for "xx", so find returns -1.
   - Update count: count = 2.
   - Increment position: position = -1 + 1 = 0.
4. Loop condition: position > 0 (0 > 0) is False. Exit loop.
5. Return count, which is 2.

Thus, the function returns 2.
