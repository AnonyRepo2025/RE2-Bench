[THOUGHT]
We are calling sinh._eval_is_finite(self) with a `self` object that only has an attribute `nargs` and no `args` attribute.  

1. The method does:
      arg = self.args[0]
2. On the instance, `self.args` does not exist, so accessing `self.args` raises an AttributeError before even indexing.
3. Therefore the call fails with an AttributeError indicating that the 'sinh' object has no attribute 'args'.
