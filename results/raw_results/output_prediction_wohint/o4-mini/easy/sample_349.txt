[THOUGHT]
1. The input dictionary is `{"noeohqhk": 623, "1049": 55}`, with both keys as strings.
2. In `f`, we do `dictionary[1049] = 55`. Here `1049` is an integer, so this adds a new key `1049` (int) with value `55`. Now the dict has three entries, in insertion order:
   1. `"noeohqhk": 623`
   2. `"1049": 55`   (string key)
   3. `1049: 55`     (int key)
3. Next, `key, value = dictionary.popitem()` removes and returns the *last* inserted item, i.e. `(1049, 55)` where the key is the integer `1049`.
4. Then `dictionary[key] = value` re-inserts that same `(1049, 55)` pair at the end. The dictionary ends up exactly as it was after step 2.
5. The final dictionary returned is:
   {
     "noeohqhk": 623,
     "1049": 55,   (string key)
     1049: 55      (int key)
   }
