[THOUGHT]
We call sign_in on a SignInSystem instance whose users dict is {"user1": True}.

1. The method checks: if "user1" not in self.users. Since "user1" is a key in the dict, this is False.
2. It goes to the else branch:
   a. It sets self.users["user1"] = True (it was already True).
   b. Returns True.
So the output of sign_in("user1") is True.
