[THOUGHT]
We call f("-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-").

1. Compute text.split(): splits on whitespace into two items:
   ["-stew---corn-and-beans-in", "soup-.-"]

2. Loop over items:

   a) item = "-stew---corn-and-beans-in"
      - We do text.replace("--stew---corn-and-beans-in", " "). The current text starts with only one hyphen, not two, so no match.
      - Then .replace("-stew---corn-and-beans-in-", " "). Our text has "-stew---corn-and-beans-in " (followed by space), not with a trailing hyphen, so no match.
      => text remains "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"

   b) item = "soup-.-"
      - Replace "-soup-.-" → no such substring (there’s a space before "soup-.-", not a hyphen).
      - Replace "soup-.--" → no such substring (would require two hyphens at end).
      => text still "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"

3. Return text.strip('-'):
   - Strips hyphens from both ends. Leading '-' removed, trailing '-' removed, but interior hyphens preserved.
   - Result is "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."

Thus the function returns "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."
