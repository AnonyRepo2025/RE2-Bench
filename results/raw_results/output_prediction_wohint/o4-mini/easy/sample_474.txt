[THOUGHT]
1. The function splits `txt` on `'\n'`, yielding two lines: `['#[)[]>[^e>', ' 8']`.
2. It then calls `line.center(marker)` with `marker = -5` on each line.
3. According to Pythonâ€™s `str.center(width)`, if `width <= len(line)`, the original `line` is returned unchanged. Here, `-5` is less than both line lengths, so each `center` call returns the line itself.
4. Joining the list with `'\n'` reconstructs the original `txt`: `#[)[]>[^e>\n 8`.
