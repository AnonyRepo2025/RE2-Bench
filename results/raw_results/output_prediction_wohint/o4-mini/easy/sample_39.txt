[THOUGHT]
1. The function `f` receives `array = [6, 2, 7, 1]` and `elem = 6`.
2. It checks `if elem in array:`. Since `6` is indeed in the list, the condition is True.
3. It then returns `array.index(elem)`, which finds the first occurrence of `6` in the list.
4. In `[6, 2, 7, 1]`, the element `6` is at index `0`.
5. Therefore, the function returns `0`.
