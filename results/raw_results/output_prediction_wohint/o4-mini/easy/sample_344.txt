[THOUGHT]
1. f is called with list = [6, 4, 2, 8, 15] and some lambda as operation.
2. Inside f, new_list = list[:] makes a shallow copy: new_list = [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].
3. new_list.sort() sorts the copy in place, so new_list becomes [2, 4, 6, 8, 15].
4. operation(new_list) is called, potentially mutating new_list further, but this does not affect the original list.
5. f returns the original list variable `list`, which was never modified and remains [6, 4, 2, 8, 15].
