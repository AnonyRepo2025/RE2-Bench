[THOUGHT]
The `__call__` method does:

    return groupby.apply(data.dropna(subset=['x', 'y']), self._fit_predict)

In the provided input:
- `data` is a plain Python dict (with keys `_mgr`, `_item_cache`, etc.), not a pandas DataFrame.
- Dicts do not have a `.dropna` method.

Thus the first operation attempted is `data.dropna(...)`, which immediately raises:

    AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'dropna'

No further code is executed.
