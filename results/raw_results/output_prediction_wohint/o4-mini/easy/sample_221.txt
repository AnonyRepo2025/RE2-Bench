[THOUGHT]
1. The function is called with text = "bpxa24fc5." and delim = "."  
2. text.split(delim) splits the string at each ".". Since the string ends with ".", the result is ["bpxa24fc5", ""]  
3. first = "bpxa24fc5", second = ""  
4. The function returns second + delim + first = "" + "." + "bpxa24fc5" = ".bpxa24fc5"
