[THOUGHT]
The helper `_parallel_fit_estimator` simply calls `estimator.fit(X, y)` (no `sample_weight`) and then returns the very same estimator instance, now fitted. In this case, `estimator` is a `LogisticRegression` initialized with
- penalty='l2'
- dual=False
- tol=0.0001
- C=1.0
- fit_intercept=True
- intercept_scaling=1
- class_weight=None
- random_state=123
- solver='warn'  (which becomes 'liblinear' with a warning)
- max_iter=100
- multi_class='warn' (which becomes 'ovr' given solver='liblinear')
- verbose=0
- warm_start=False
- n_jobs=None
- l1_ratio=None

After fitting on the classic 150‐sample Iris data with 3 classes, the estimator will have attributes:
- `classes_ = array([0, 1, 2])`
- `coef_` shaped (3, 2)
- `intercept_` length 3
- `n_iter_` length 3

Since we cannot feasibly hand‐compute the exact coefficient values, the important point is: the function returns the fitted estimator instance.
