[THOUGHT]
1. The function is called with s="@@@ff" and ch="@".
2. Initialize sl = s, so sl = "@@@ff".
3. Check if ch ("@") is in s: True (s contains "@").
4. Execute sl = s.lstrip(ch): removes all leading "@" characters from "@@@ff", resulting in "ff".
5. Check if len(sl) == 0: len("ff") is 2, so this is False. We do not append "!?".
6. The function returns sl, which is "ff".
