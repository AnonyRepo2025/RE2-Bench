[THOUGHT]
1. The function is called with array = [2, 15, 15, 1] and list = [15, 1].
2. array.extend(list) mutates array in place, so array becomes [2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1].
3. The next line builds [e for e in array if e % 2 == 0], which evaluates to [2], but it isn’t assigned or used, so it has no effect.
4. The return statement is [e for e in array if e >= 10]. Scanning array [2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1], the elements ≥ 10 are 15, 15, and 15.
5. Therefore the function returns [15, 15, 15].
