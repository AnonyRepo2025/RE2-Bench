[THOUGHT]
1. The function f is called with n = "first-second-third".
2. Convert n to string: str(n) is still "first-second-third".
3. n[0] is the first character, "f".
4. n[1:] is the substring from index 1 to the end: "irst-second-third".
5. Replace all '-' in "irst-second-third" with '_', yielding "irst_second_third".
6. Concatenate n[0], a dot '.', and the replaced substring: "f" + "." + "irst_second_third" = "f.irst_second_third".
