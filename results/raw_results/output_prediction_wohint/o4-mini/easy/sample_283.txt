[THOUGHT]
We call f(dictionary, key) with key = "Iron Man".

1. The function attempts `del dictionary[key]`.
2. Since "Iron Man" is not a key in the dictionary, Python raises a KeyError at that line.
3. No further code in the function executes and nothing is returned.

So the result is a KeyError exception.

  "error": "KeyError: 'Iron Man'"
