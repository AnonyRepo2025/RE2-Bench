[THOUGHT]
We have self.employees = {"1": {...}} (the key is the string "1").
remove_employee is called with employee_id = 2 (an integer).
The method checks `if employee_id in self.employees:` which is `2 in {"1":...}`.
Since the key "1" != 2, the check fails.
Therefore it goes to the else branch and returns False.
