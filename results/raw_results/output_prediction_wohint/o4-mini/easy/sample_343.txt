[THOUGHT]
The function f calls array.extend(elem), which appends each element of elem to the end of array.

- Initial array has 6 elements:
  1. [1, 2, 3]
  2. [1, 2]
  3. 1
  4. [1, 2, 3]
  5. 3
  6. [2, 1]

- elem has 3 elements:
  a. [1, 2, 3]
  b. 3
  c. [2, 1]

After extend, those three are added in order, giving 9 elements total:

[
 [1,2,3],
 [1,2],
 1,
 [1,2,3],
 3,
 [2,1],
 [1,2,3],
 3,
 [2,1]
]

This list is returned.
