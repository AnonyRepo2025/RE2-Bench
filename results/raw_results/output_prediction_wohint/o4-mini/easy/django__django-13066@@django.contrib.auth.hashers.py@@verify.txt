[THOUGHT]
1. Call to self._load_library() will import the “argon2” module.
2. The encoded string is split on the first “$”:
   algorithm = "argon2"
   rest = "argon2id$v=19$m=102400,t=2,p=8$Y041dExhNkljRUUy$TMa6A8fPJhCAUXRhJXCXdw"
3. The assertion “algorithm == self.algorithm” passes (“argon2” == “argon2”).
4. We call argon2.PasswordHasher().verify("$" + rest, "secret"), i.e.
   verify("$argon2id$v=19$m=102400,t=2,p=8$…", "secret").
5. Assuming the hash was generated from “secret” with those parameters, the verify call succeeds and returns True.
