[THOUGHT]
1. The function f is called with text = "a loved".
2. `text.split()` splits the string on whitespace into the list ["a", "loved"].
3. `my_list.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list in descending (reverse lexicographical) order. Since "loved" > "a" lexicographically, the list becomes ["loved", "a"].
4. `' '.join(my_list)` joins the list with a space, producing the string "loved a".
