[THOUGHT]
We have an instance `self` of Thermostat with attributes:
- current_temperature = 25
- target_temperature = 25
- mode = "heat"

We call `set_target_temperature(10)`:
1. The method body executes `self.target_temperature = temperature`, so `self.target_temperature` becomes 10.
2. There is no return statement, so the method returns `None` by default in Python.

Therefore, the output (return value) of `set_target_temperature` is `None`.
