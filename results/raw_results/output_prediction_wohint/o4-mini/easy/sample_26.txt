[THOUGHT]
1. Split `items` by whitespace: ["qy.", "dg.", "rnvprt", "rse..", "irtwv", "tx.."].
2. Iterate over each token `i`:
   - First `i = "qy."`.
   - Check `if i in target`:  
     - `"qy."` is not a substring of `"wtwdoacb"`, so this is False.
   - Next check `if i.index('.') == len(i) - 1 or i.index('.') == 0`:
     - `i.index('.')` is 2 (the dot is at position 2 in "qy.").
     - `len(i) - 1` is also 2.
     - Since 2 == 2, the condition is True.
   - Therefore the function returns "error" immediately.
3. No further tokens are examined.
