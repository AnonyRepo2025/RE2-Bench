[THOUGHT]
We call f with array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

1. result = array.copy()  
   result is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

2. result.reverse()  
   This reverses in place, so result becomes [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

3. result[:] = [item * 2 for item in result]  
   We build a new list by doubling each element of the current result:
   - 5 * 2 = 10
   - 4 * 2 = 8
   - 3 * 2 = 6
   - 2 * 2 = 4
   - 1 * 2 = 2  
   So the new list is [10, 8, 6, 4, 2], and assigning to result[:] updates result in place to [10, 8, 6, 4, 2].

4. return result  
   The function returns [10, 8, 6, 4, 2].
