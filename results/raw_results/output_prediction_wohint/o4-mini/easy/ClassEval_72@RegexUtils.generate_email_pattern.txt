[THOUGHT]
The method `generate_email_pattern` simply returns the local variable `pattern`, which was assigned the literal string  
  '\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'  
Because this is a Python string literal with double backslashes, at runtime each '\\' becomes a single '\' in the returned string.  
There are no inputs affecting the result, so the output is that exact regex string:  
  \b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b  
When representing this in JSON, backslashes must be escaped, yielding "\\b...\\b".

[OUTPUT]
{
    "output": "\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b"
}
