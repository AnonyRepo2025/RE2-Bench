[THOUGHT]
The function f(a, b) returns a new dict by unpacking all key–value pairs from a, then from b, with b’s entries overriding any duplicate keys from a.

Given:
a = {"w": 5, "wi": 10}
b = {"w": 3}

1. Unpack a: result starts as {"w": 5, "wi": 10}
2. Unpack b: the key "w" exists, so its value is replaced by 3

Final result: {"w": 3, "wi": 10}

{
    "output": {
        "w": 3,
        "wi": 10
