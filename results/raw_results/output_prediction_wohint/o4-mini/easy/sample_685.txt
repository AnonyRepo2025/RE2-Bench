[THOUGHT]
1. The function f takes `array` and `elem`.
2. It computes `array.count(elem)`, which counts how many times `elem` appears in `array`.
3. Here, `array = [1, 1, 1]` and `elem = -2`.
4. `array.count(-2)` is 0 because -2 does not appear in the list.
5. The function returns `0 + (-2)`, which is -2.
