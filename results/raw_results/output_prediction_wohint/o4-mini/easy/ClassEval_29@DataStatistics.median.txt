[THOUGHT]
We call median on data = [2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8].
1. Sort the data: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
2. n = 7, which is odd.
3. middle index = n // 2 = 7 // 2 = 3 (0-based indexing).
4. The element at index 3 of the sorted list is 5.
5. Since n is odd, the method returns this element directly.
Therefore, the result is 5.
