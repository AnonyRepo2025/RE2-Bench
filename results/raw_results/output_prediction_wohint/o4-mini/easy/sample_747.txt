[THOUGHT]
1. The input text is "123E-10".
2. The function first checks if text == '42.42'. It does not, so we proceed.
3. Compute len(text) = 7, so the loop iterates i over range(3, 7-3) = range(3,4), i.e. only i = 3.
4. At i = 3, text[3] is 'E', which is not '.', so the if condition fails.
5. The loop completes without finding a match, so the function returns False.
