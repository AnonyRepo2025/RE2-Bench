[THOUGHT]
We start with text = "pxcznyf", so rtext = ['p','x','c','z','n','y','f'] (length 7).  
The loop is for i in range(1, len(rtext)-1) → range(1,6) → i = 1,2,3,4,5. Note the range is fixed before we mutate rtext.  
Each iteration does rtext.insert(i+1, '|'). But as we insert, the original 'c' (initially at index 2) keeps getting pushed right, and each insertion position i+1 always equals the current index of 'c'. So every pipe ends up immediately before the 'c'.  

Step by step:
- i=1: insert at index 2 → rtext = ['p','x','|','c','z','n','y','f']
- i=2: insert at index 3 → ['p','x','|','|','c','z','n','y','f']
- i=3: insert at index 4 → ['p','x','|','|','|','c','z','n','y','f']
- i=4: insert at index 5 → ['p','x','|','|','|','|','c','z','n','y','f']
- i=5: insert at index 6 → ['p','x','|','|','|','|','|','c','z','n','y','f']

Finally, we join to get "px|||||cznyf".
