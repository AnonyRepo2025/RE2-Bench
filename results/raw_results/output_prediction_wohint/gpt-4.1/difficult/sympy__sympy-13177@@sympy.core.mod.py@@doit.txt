[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `doit(p, q)` inside the `Mod` class, given the input `p = zoo`, `q = 0`.

First, recall that in SymPy, `zoo` is the symbol for the complex infinity (the "point at infinity" on the Riemann sphere).

Let's step through the function:

1. The first check is:
   ```python
   if p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or (q is nan):
       return nan
   ```
   - `p` is `zoo`, which is infinite, so `p.is_infinite` is True.
   - Therefore, this condition is satisfied, and the function immediately returns `nan`.

No further code is executed.

So, the output is `nan`.
