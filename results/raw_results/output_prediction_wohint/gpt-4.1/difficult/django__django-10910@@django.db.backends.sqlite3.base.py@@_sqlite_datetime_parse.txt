Let's step through the function `_sqlite_datetime_parse(dt, tzname, conn_tzname)` with the given input:

- dt = "2016-06-13 00:00:00"
- tzname = "UTC"
- conn_tzname = "UTC"

1. The function first checks if `dt` is None. It is not, so continue.
2. It tries to parse `dt` using `backend_utils.typecast_timestamp(dt)`.
   - `typecast_timestamp("2016-06-13 00:00:00")`:
     - ' ' is in the string, so it splits into d = "2016-06-13", t = "00:00:00"
     - No '-' or '+' in t, so t remains "00:00:00"
     - dates = ["2016", "06", "13"]
     - times = ["00", "00", "00"]
     - seconds = "00"
     - No '.' in seconds, so microseconds = "0"
     - tzinfo = utc if settings.USE_TZ else None (let's assume USE_TZ is True, so tzinfo = utc)
     - Returns datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)
   - So, dt is now a timezone-aware datetime in UTC: 2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00

3. Next, if conn_tzname is set, it does: dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.timezone(conn_tzname))
   - conn_tzname is "UTC", so dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.timezone("UTC"))
   - dt is already in UTC, but this forcibly sets tzinfo to pytz.UTC (which is fine).

4. Now, if tzname is not None and tzname != conn_tzname:
   - tzname == conn_tzname == "UTC", so this block is skipped.

5. Returns dt.

So the output is a datetime object: 2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00 (with tzinfo=pytz.UTC).

In JSON, this is usually represented as an ISO string: "2016-06-13T00:00:00+00:00"
