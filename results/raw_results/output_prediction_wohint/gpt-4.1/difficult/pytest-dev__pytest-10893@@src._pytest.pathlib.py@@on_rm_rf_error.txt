[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `on_rm_rf_error` with the given input.

Inputs:
- func: "<function unlink>" (but in reality, this would be the actual function object, e.g., os.unlink)
- path: "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_on_rm_rf_error0/dir/foo.txt"
- excinfo: {} (empty dict, but in real use, this would be an exception or a tuple)
- start_path: "/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_on_rm_rf_error0"

Step 1: The function checks if excinfo is a BaseException. It's an empty dict, so it's not.
Step 2: It tries to get exc = excinfo[1]. But excinfo is an empty dict, so excinfo[1] will raise a KeyError.

So, the function will raise a KeyError at this line:
    exc = excinfo[1]

Therefore, the output will be an exception: KeyError: 1
