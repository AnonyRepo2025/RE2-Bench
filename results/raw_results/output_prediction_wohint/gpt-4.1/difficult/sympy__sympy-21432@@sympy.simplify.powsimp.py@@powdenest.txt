[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `powdenest` with the given input.

Input:
- eq: "_x" (likely a symbol, as per SymPy convention)
- force: False
- polar: False

Step 1: The function checks if `force` is True. It is not, so we skip the first block.

Step 2: The function checks if `polar` is True. It is not, so we skip the second block.

Step 3: The function does:
```python
new = powsimp(sympify(eq))
return new.xreplace(Transform(_denest_pow, filter=lambda m: m.is_Pow or isinstance(m, exp)))
```
- `sympify(eq)` will convert the string "_x" to a SymPy symbol `_x`.
- `powsimp(_x)` will attempt to simplify powers in the expression `_x`. Since `_x` is just a symbol, it remains `_x`.
- `new.xreplace(Transform(_denest_pow, ...))` will attempt to apply `_denest_pow` to any Pow or exp in the expression. Since `_x` is just a symbol (not a power or exp), nothing will be replaced.

So the output is just the symbol `_x`.
