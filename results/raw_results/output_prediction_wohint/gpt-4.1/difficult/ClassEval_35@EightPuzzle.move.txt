[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step:

1. The method called is `move` with:
   - state = [
       [1, 6, 2],
       [7, 8, 0],
       [4, 5, 3]
     ]
   - direction = "left"

2. The first step in `move` is to find the blank (0) position using `find_blank`.

3. `find_blank` iterates over the state:
   - i=0: [1, 6, 2] → no 0
   - i=1: [7, 8, 0] → j=2 is 0, so returns (1, 2)

4. Now, in `move`, i=1, j=2 (blank at row 1, col 2).

5. Make a deep copy of the state: new_state = [
       [1, 6, 2],
       [7, 8, 0],
       [4, 5, 3]
     ]

6. Direction is "left":
   - The code: new_state[i][j], new_state[i][j - 1] = (new_state[i][j - 1], new_state[i][j])
   - i=1, j=2 → swap new_state[1][2] and new_state[1][1]
   - new_state[1][2] = 0, new_state[1][1] = 8
   - After swap: new_state[1][2] = 8, new_state[1][1] = 0

7. The resulting new_state is:
   - Row 0: [1, 6, 2]
   - Row 1: [7, 0, 8]
   - Row 2: [4, 5, 3]

So the output is:
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [7, 0, 8],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
