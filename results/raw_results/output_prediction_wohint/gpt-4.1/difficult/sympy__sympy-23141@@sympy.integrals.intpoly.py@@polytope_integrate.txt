[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `polytope_integrate` with the given input.

Input:
- poly: {} (an empty dict)
- expr: "x**2 + x*y + y**2" (a string)

Step 1: The function starts by checking `clockwise`, which is False by default, so nothing happens in the first if.

Step 2: Next, it checks if `poly` is a Polygon. It is not (it's an empty dict).

Step 3: Then, it checks if `len(poly[0]) == 2`. But `poly` is an empty dict, so `poly[0]` will raise a KeyError.

Step 4: The next else block is for the case where `poly` is a tuple/list of (vertices, facets), but again, since `poly` is an empty dict, `vertices = poly[0]` will raise a KeyError.

So, at the first attempt to access `poly[0]`, a KeyError will be raised.

Therefore, the function will not proceed further and will raise an exception.

Expected output: an error indicating KeyError: 0.
