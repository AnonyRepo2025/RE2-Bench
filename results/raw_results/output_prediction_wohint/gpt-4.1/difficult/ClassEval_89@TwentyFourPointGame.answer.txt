[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:

1. self.nums = [1, 1, 1, 1]
2. answer("1+1+1+2") is called.

First, expression != 'pass', so we proceed.

statistic = {}
For each character in "1+1+1+2":
- '1': isdigit() and int('1') in self.nums → True. statistic['1'] = 1
- '+': not digit, skip
- '1': isdigit() and int('1') in self.nums → True. statistic['1'] = 2
- '+': skip
- '1': isdigit() and int('1') in self.nums → True. statistic['1'] = 3
- '+': skip
- '2': isdigit() and int('2') in self.nums → False (2 not in [1,1,1,1]), so skip

So statistic = {'1': 3}

nums_used = {'1': 3}

Now, for num in self.nums:
- num=1: nums_used.get('1', -100) = 3 > 0 → nums_used['1'] -= 1 → now 2
- num=1: nums_used.get('1', -100) = 2 > 0 → nums_used['1'] -= 1 → now 1
- num=1: nums_used.get('1', -100) = 1 > 0 → nums_used['1'] -= 1 → now 0
- num=1: nums_used.get('1', -100) = 0 (not > 0), so else: return False

So the function returns False at this point, because there are not enough '1's in the expression to match the number of '1's in self.nums (actually, there are, but the code expects the number of times each number is used in the expression to match the number of times it appears in self.nums, and also that no extra numbers are used).

But let's check: the expression is "1+1+1+2", so the digits used are three '1's and one '2'. But '2' is not in self.nums, so the code never adds '2' to statistic, so nums_used only has '1':3.

But in the for num in self.nums loop, it expects to find four '1's, but nums_used only has three. So on the fourth iteration, nums_used.get('1', -100) = 0, which is not > 0, so it returns False.

Therefore, the output is False.
