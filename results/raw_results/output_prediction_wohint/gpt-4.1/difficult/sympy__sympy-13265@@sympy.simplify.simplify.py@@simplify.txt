[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the execution of `simplify(expr="50")` step by step:

1. The input is the string "50".
2. The first line in `simplify` is `expr = sympify(expr)`. This will convert the string "50" into a SymPy Integer object with value 50.
3. The next block is a try/except for `expr._eval_simplify`, but Integer does not have this method, so it passes.
4. Then, `original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)` is called. For an Integer, `signsimp` will just return the Integer itself, so `expr` is still 50.
5. The next block checks if `expr` is not a Basic or has no args. Integer(50) is a Basic, but it has no args, so this block triggers and returns `expr` immediately.
6. Therefore, the output is the SymPy Integer 50.

Since the output is expected in JSON, and the input was "50", the output should be the string "50" (or the integer 50, depending on the expected format).
