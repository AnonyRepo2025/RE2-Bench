[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The initial state is already the goal state:
   [
       [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 0]
   ]
   The goal state is the same.

2. The solve() method starts with open_list containing the initial state and an empty path: open_list = [([initial_state], [])]

3. The while loop pops the first element: current_state = initial_state, path = []

4. It appends current_state to closed_list.

5. It checks if current_state == goal_state. This is True.

6. It returns path, which is [].

So, the output will be an empty list, meaning no moves are needed.
