Let's analyze what the `args_cnc` method does in the `MatMul` class.

- The method signature is: `def args_cnc(self, **kwargs):`
- It calls `self.as_coeff_matrices()`, which returns a tuple `(coeff, matrices)`, where:
    - `coeff` is the product of all scalar (non-matrix) arguments in `self.args`
    - `matrices` is a list of all matrix arguments in `self.args`
- Then, it calls `coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)`. This is a method from SymPy's `Mul` class, which splits the arguments of a multiplication into commutative (`c`) and non-commutative (`nc`) parts.
- It then checks if `coeff_c == [1]` or `coeff_c == set([1])` and replaces with empty list/set.
- Finally, it returns `(coeff_c, coeff_nc + matrices)`

Given the input:
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {},
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
This is a bit ambiguous, but since there are no explicit arguments, we can assume that `self.args` is empty.

Let's step through the logic:

1. `self.as_coeff_matrices()`:
    - `scalars = [x for x in self.args if not x.is_Matrix]` → empty list
    - `matrices = [x for x in self.args if x.is_Matrix]` → empty list
    - `coeff = Mul(*scalars)` → Mul() of empty list, which is 1
    - So, returns `(1, [])`

2. `coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)`:
    - `coeff` is 1 (the integer 1 in SymPy)
    - For 1, `args_cnc()` returns `([1], [])` (commutative part is [1], non-commutative is empty)

3. The code then checks:
    - `if coeff_c == [1]: coeff_c = []`
    - So, `coeff_c` becomes `[]`

4. Returns `(coeff_c, coeff_nc + matrices)`:
    - `coeff_c` is `[]`
    - `coeff_nc` is `[]`
    - `matrices` is `[]`
    - So, returns `([], [])`

Therefore, the output is:
```
{
    "result": [[], []]
}
```
