[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the input and the function step by step.

1. The function is `unparse(node)`.
2. The input `node` is a dictionary with keys: "elts": null, "ctx": {}, "lineno": 1, "col_offset": 0, "end_lineno": 1, "end_col_offset": 9.

3. The function expects an `ast.AST` node, but the input is a dict. However, let's assume the dict represents an AST node, and the relevant field is "elts": null.

4. In the function, the first check is if node is None: return None. Here, node is not None.

5. Next, it checks if node is a string: not the case.

6. Next, it checks if node.__class__ in OPERATORS: not the case (dict).

7. Then, it checks for various ast types using isinstance. Since the input is a dict, none of these isinstance checks will pass.

8. At the end, if sys.version_info > (3, 6) and isinstance(node, ast.Constant): not the case.

9. Otherwise, it raises NotImplementedError('Unable to parse %s object' % type(node).__name__).

So, since the input is a dict, not an ast.AST node, the function will reach the final else and raise NotImplementedError('Unable to parse dict object').

Therefore, the output will be an exception: NotImplementedError with the message "Unable to parse dict object".
