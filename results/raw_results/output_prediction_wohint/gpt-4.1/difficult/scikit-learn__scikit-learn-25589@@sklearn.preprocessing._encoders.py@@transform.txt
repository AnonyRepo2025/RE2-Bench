[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the execution of `OneHotEncoder.transform` with the given input.

1. **Input structure**:
   - `self` is a OneHotEncoder instance with:
     - `categories_`: null (i.e., not fitted)
     - `n_features_in_`: 1
     - `handle_unknown`: "infrequent_if_exist"
     - `_infrequent_enabled`: false
     - `drop`: null
     - `sparse_output`: true
   - `X` is a 2x1 array: `[['55555'], ['22']]`

2. **First step in `transform`**:
   - `check_is_fitted(self)` is called.
   - This will check that the estimator is fitted by looking for attributes ending with `_`. The most important is `categories_`.
   - In our input, `categories_` is null (i.e., not set). This means the encoder has not been fitted.

3. **What happens if not fitted?**
   - `check_is_fitted` will raise a `NotFittedError` (or a ValueError) if the estimator is not fitted.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function will not proceed to transform, but will raise an error indicating that the encoder is not fitted yet.

5. **Output**:
   - The output should be an error message indicating the estimator is not fitted.

6. **Format**:
   - Since the output is expected in JSON, we should return an error message.
