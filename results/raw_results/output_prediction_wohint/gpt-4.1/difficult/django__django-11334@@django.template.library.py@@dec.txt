[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze what happens when `dec` is called with a function `func` as input.

1. The method in question is `simple_tag`, and the inner function `dec` is being called with a function object as its argument.
2. The code for `dec` does the following:
   - It uses `getfullargspec(unwrap(func))` to get the function signature. This is for introspection, not relevant for output.
   - It determines `function_name` as `name` (which is None) or the function's name. In this case, `name` is None, so it uses `getattr(func, '_decorated_function', func).__name__`. Since `func` is a plain function, this is just `func.__name__`, which is `"func"`.
   - It defines an inner function `compile_func` (which is a closure over `func`, `takes_context`, etc).
   - It calls `self.tag(function_name, compile_func)`. This would register the tag in `self.tags` (if `self` is a Library instance), but since `self` is just an empty dict in the input, this is a no-op for our output.
   - Finally, it returns `func`.

So, the output of `dec(func)` is simply the original `func` object.

Given the input, the output should be the same function object as passed in.

In JSON, we can't serialize a function, but in the input, the function is represented as a dict with its attributes. So the output should be the same dict as the input's `"func"`.
