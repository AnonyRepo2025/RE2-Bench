[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:

1. The input is an empty list: data = []
2. The function first checks if type(data) != list and type(data) != tuple. In this case, type(data) == list, so it passes.
3. Next, it checks if len(data) == 0. Since data is an empty list, len(data) == 0 is True.
4. In this case, it returns (0.0, [0.0]).

So the output will be (0.0, [0.0]).
