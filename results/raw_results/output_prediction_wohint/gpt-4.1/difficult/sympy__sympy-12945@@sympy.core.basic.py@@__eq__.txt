Let's walk through the `__eq__` method of the `Basic` class with the given input.

- `self` is an instance of `Basic` (details not given, but let's proceed generically).
- `other` is the string `"I*x"`.

Step-by-step:

1. The first check is `if self is other:`. This is False, since `other` is a string.

2. Next: `if type(self) is not type(other):`
   - `type(self)` is `Basic` (or a subclass).
   - `type(other)` is `str`.
   - So, this is True.

3. Now, it checks for special cases with `Pow`, but since `self` is not a `Pow` and `other` is a string, these are skipped.

4. Then, it tries to `_sympify(other)`. This calls `sympify("I*x", strict=True)`.
   - `sympify` will parse the string `"I*x"` into a SymPy expression, which is `I*x` (where `I` is the imaginary unit and `x` is a symbol).

5. Now, `other` is a SymPy expression representing `I*x`.

6. The next check: `if type(self) != type(other):`
   - If `self` is a bare `Basic` instance, and `other` is a `Mul` (the type of `I*x`), this is True.
   - So, it returns `False`.

Therefore, the output is `False`.
