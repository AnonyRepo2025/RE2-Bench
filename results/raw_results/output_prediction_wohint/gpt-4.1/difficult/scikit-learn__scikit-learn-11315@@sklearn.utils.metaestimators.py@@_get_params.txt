Let's step through the execution of `_get_params` with the given input.

1. The method signature is: `_get_params(self, attr, deep=True)`.
   - self: an object with attributes: transformers, remainder, n_jobs, transformer_weights.
   - args: attr = "_transformers"
   - kwargs: deep = True

2. The first line is:
   ```
   out = super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)
   ```
   - This calls `BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=True)`.
   - The implementation of `get_params`:
     - It loops over `self._get_param_names()`.
     - For each param name, gets the value from self.
     - If deep and value has get_params, it recursively adds sub-parameters with key prefix.
     - Otherwise, just adds the value.

3. What are the param names? This is determined by `self._get_param_names()`.
   - This is a class method that inspects the signature of `__init__`.
   - Since we don't have the actual class definition, but from the attributes, likely param names are: 'transformers', 'remainder', 'n_jobs', 'transformer_weights'.

4. For each param:
   - transformers: value is null (None).
   - remainder: value is a dict: {"with_mean": true, "with_std": false, "copy": true}
     - It is a dict, so does not have get_params.
   - n_jobs: 1
   - transformer_weights: null

   So, the output of `get_params` is:
   ```
   {
     "transformers": None,
     "remainder": {"with_mean": true, "with_std": false, "copy": true},
     "n_jobs": 1,
     "transformer_weights": None
   }
   ```

5. Next, in `_get_params`:
   ```
   if not deep:
       return out
   ```
   - deep is True, so continue.

6. Next:
   ```
   estimators = getattr(self, attr)
   out.update(estimators)
   ```
   - attr = "_transformers"
   - getattr(self, "_transformers")
   - In sklearn, _transformers is a property that returns a list of (name, trans) for each transformer in self.transformers.
   - But in our input, self.transformers is null (None).
   - So, _transformers would return an empty list.

7. So, estimators = []
   - out.update(estimators) does nothing.

8. Next:
   ```
   for name, estimator in estimators:
       if hasattr(estimator, 'get_params'):
           for key, value in six.iteritems(estimator.get_params(deep=True)):
               out['%s__%s' % (name, key)] = value
   ```
   - Since estimators is empty, this loop does nothing.

9. Finally, return out.

So, the output is:
{
  "transformers": null,
  "remainder": {"with_mean": true, "with_std": false, "copy": true},
  "n_jobs": 1,
  "transformer_weights": null
}
