[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `restify` with the given input.

1. The input is a dictionary with key "cls", which is itself a dictionary with key "__module__" set to "tests.test_util_typing".
2. The function starts by checking if `cls` is None or NoneType. It is not.
3. Next, it checks if `cls` is Ellipsis. It is not.
4. Then, it checks if `cls` is in INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES. It is not.
5. Then, it checks if `inspect.isNewType(cls)` is True. Let's see what happens here:
   - `isNewType` tries to get `__module__` and `__qualname__` from `cls` using `safe_getattr`.
   - `safe_getattr` will try to do `getattr(cls, '__module__', None)`. But `cls` is a dict, not a type, so this will raise an Exception.
   - The exception is caught, and it tries to get `cls['__module__']`, which is "tests.test_util_typing".
   - Similarly, it tries to get `__qualname__`, which is not present, so it returns None.
   - So, `__module__` is "tests.test_util_typing", `__qualname__` is None.
   - The check `if __module__ == 'typing' and __qualname__ == 'NewType.<locals>.new_type'` is False.
   - So, `isNewType` returns False.
6. Next, it checks if `types_Union` and isinstance(cls, types_Union) -- but `types_Union` is `types.Union`, and `cls` is a dict, so this is False.
7. Next, it checks if `cls.__module__ in ('__builtin__', 'builtins')`. But `cls` is a dict, so accessing `cls.__module__` will raise an AttributeError.
8. This is not caught, so the function will raise an AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute '__module__'.

Therefore, the output will be an exception: AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute '__module__'.
