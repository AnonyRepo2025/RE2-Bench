[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the function step by step with the input:

Input expr: "(1 + \"exp(2)\")/(y*(-1 + \"exp(2)\"))"

First, note that the input is a string, and the "exp(2)" is in quotes, so when sympify is called, it will parse this as a mathematical expression with exp(2) as the exponential function.

So, sympify("(1 + exp(2))/(y*(-1 + exp(2)))") will produce the SymPy expression:
(1 + exp(2)) / (y * (-1 + exp(2)))

Now, let's look at the function exptrigsimp:

1. It defines exp_trig(e):
   - choices = [e]
   - if e.has(*_trigs): choices.append(e.rewrite(exp))
   - choices.append(e.rewrite(cos))
   - return min(*choices, key=count_ops)

2. newexpr = bottom_up(expr, exp_trig)
   - This will traverse the expression tree and try to rewrite trigonometric/hyperbolic functions as exponentials or cosines, but our expression only has exp(2), so nothing will change.

3. Then, it defines f(rv):
   - If not rv.is_Mul: return rv
   - So, only acts on Mul objects.

   - rvd = rv.as_powers_dict()
   - newd = rvd.copy()
   - Then, it tries to find terms involving S.Exp1, and do some manipulations, but in our case, the expression is a fraction, not a Mul.

   - So, bottom_up(newexpr, f) will not change the expression.

4. If newexpr.has(HyperbolicFunction): ... (not the case)
5. If newexpr.has(TrigonometricFunction): ... (not the case)
6. If not (newexpr.has(I) and (not expr.has(I))): expr = newexpr

So, the function will return the original expression, possibly simplified.

But let's check if SymPy will simplify (1 + exp(2)) / (y * (-1 + exp(2))) further.

Let E = exp(2). Then, the expression is (1 + E) / (y * (E - 1))

This is already in a simple form. SymPy will not further simplify unless asked.

So, the output will be the same as the input, but with exp(2) instead of "exp(2)", and the denominator written as (exp(2) - 1) instead of (-1 + exp(2)).

So, the output will be:

(1 + exp(2)) / (y * (exp(2) - 1))

In SymPy, this will be represented as:

(1 + exp(2)) / (y*(exp(2) - 1))

So, the output is:

"(1 + exp(2))/(y*(exp(2) - 1))"
