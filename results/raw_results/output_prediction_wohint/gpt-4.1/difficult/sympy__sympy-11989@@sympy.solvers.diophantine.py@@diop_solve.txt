[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the execution of `diop_solve(eq)` with `eq = 2*x - 3*y - 5`.

1. The function `diop_solve` is called with `eq = 2*x - 3*y - 5` and the default `param=symbols('t', integer=True)`.

2. The first step is to call `classify_diop(eq, _dict=False)`.

3. Inside `classify_diop`:
   - `var = list(eq.free_symbols)` will find the free symbols in the equation, which are `x` and `y`.
   - `var.sort(key=default_sort_key)` will sort them, but for two variables, let's assume the order is `[x, y]`.
   - `eq = eq.expand(force=True)` does nothing since the equation is already expanded.
   - `coeff = eq.as_coefficients_dict()` will give a mapping from terms to coefficients:
     - `x`: 2
     - `y`: -3
     - `1`: -5
   - All coefficients are integers.
   - `total_degree = Poly(eq).total_degree()`:
     - The highest degree is 1 (since both x and y are to the first power).
   - `homogeneous = 1 not in coeff`:
     - 1 is in coeff, so `homogeneous = False`.
   - Since `total_degree == 1`, `diop_type = 'linear'`.
   - So, `classify_diop` returns: ([x, y], coeff, 'linear'), where coeff is a defaultdict or dict: {x: 2, y: -3, 1: -5}.

4. Back in `diop_solve`, since `eq_type == 'linear'`, it calls `_diop_linear(var, coeff, param)`.

5. `_diop_linear` is not shown, but for a linear equation of the form `a*x + b*y + c = 0`, the general integer solution is:
   - `a*x + b*y = -c`
   - For `2*x - 3*y = 5`
   - The general solution is:
     - Find particular solution (x0, y0) to `2*x - 3*y = 5`
     - The general solution is:
       - x = x0 + (b/d)*t
       - y = y0 - (a/d)*t
       - where d = gcd(a, b), t is integer parameter

   Let's compute:
   - a = 2, b = -3, c = -5
   - d = gcd(2, -3) = 1
   - Find particular solution to 2*x - 3*y = 5

   Let's use the extended Euclidean algorithm to solve for x and y:
   - 2*x - 3*y = 5
   - Let's solve for integer solutions.

   Let's use the method:
   - 2*x - 3*y = 5
   - 2*x = 5 + 3*y
   - x = (5 + 3*y)/2

   For integer x, (5 + 3*y) must be even.
   Let's try y = t, t integer.

   5 + 3*t even => 3*t even => t even or t odd, but 3*t is always odd/even as t is odd/even.
   Let's try t = 1:
   - 5 + 3*1 = 8, 8/2 = 4, x = 4, y = 1 is a solution.

   Let's check: 2*4 - 3*1 = 8 - 3 = 5. Yes.

   So, particular solution: x0 = 4, y0 = 1

   The general solution is:
   - x = x0 + (b/d)*t = 4 + (-3)*t
   - y = y0 - (a/d)*t = 1 - 2*t

   So, the set of solutions is:
   - x = 4 - 3*t
   - y = 1 - 2*t
   - for t in Z

   The output should be a set containing a tuple of these expressions in terms of t.

   In sympy, the output is usually:
   { (4 - 3*t, 1 - 2*t) }

   But since t is a parameter, it may be represented as a symbol.

   So, the output is:
   { (4 - 3*t, 1 - 2*t) }
