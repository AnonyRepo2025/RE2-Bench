[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the board and the check_winner logic.

- The board is 10x10.
- The first row (row 0) has: ["O", "O", "O", "O", "O", " ", ...] -- five "O"s in a row, horizontally.
- The sixth row (row 5) has: [" ", "X", "X", "X", "X", "X", " ", ...] -- five "X"s in a row, horizontally.

The check_winner function:
- Iterates over every cell.
- For each non-empty cell, checks in four directions (right, down, down-right, down-left) for five in a row.

Let's see what happens:
- At (0,0): "O"
    - Check right (0,1): (0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4) are all "O" (from the board).
    - So, five in a row horizontally for "O" at the top left.
    - The function will return "O" as soon as it finds this.

Even though there is also a five-in-a-row for "X" at (5,1)-(5,5), the function will return the first winner it finds, which is "O".

So the output is "O".
