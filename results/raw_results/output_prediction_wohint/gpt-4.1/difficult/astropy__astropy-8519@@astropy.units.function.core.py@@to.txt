[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the `to` method of `FunctionUnitBase` with the given input.

1. **Inputs**:
   - `self` is a FunctionUnitBase instance with:
     - `_physical_unit`: a unit object (meter)
     - `_function_unit`: an object with `_scale` -2.0
   - `other` is a unit object (meter)
   - `value` is "2.5" (string, but likely should be float)
   - `equivalencies` is null (so will be treated as empty list)

2. **First check**: `if other is self.physical_unit`
   - `self.physical_unit` is not shown directly, but from the code, it's likely a property returning `self._physical_unit`.
   - `other` is a unit object with the same attributes as `self._physical_unit`, but not the same object (not the same id).
   - So, this check is False.

3. **Get `other_function_unit`**:
   - `other_function_unit = getattr(other, 'function_unit', other)`
   - `other` is a unit object, which likely does not have a `function_unit` attribute, so `other_function_unit = other`.

4. **Check equivalence**: `if self.function_unit.is_equivalent(other_function_unit)`
   - `self.function_unit` is likely a property returning `self._function_unit`.
   - So, `self._function_unit.is_equivalent(other_function_unit)` is called.
   - `other_function_unit` is a unit object (meter), `self._function_unit` is a function unit object (with _scale -2.0).
   - Unless the function unit's `is_equivalent` method is overridden to return True for a plain unit, this is likely False.

5. **Else block**:
   - Try: `return self.physical_unit.to(other, self.to_physical(value), equivalencies)`
   - `self.physical_unit` is the unit object (meter).
   - `self.to_physical(value)` is called.
     - This method is not shown, but likely converts the value from the function unit to the physical unit.
     - Given that `_scale` is -2.0, it's possible that `to_physical(value)` applies the scale.
     - Let's assume `to_physical(value)` returns the value as a float, possibly multiplied by the scale.
     - So, `to_physical("2.5")` â†’ float("2.5") * -2.0 = -5.0 (if that's the logic).
   - Then, `self.physical_unit.to(other, -5.0, equivalencies)`
     - `self.physical_unit` and `other` are both the same unit (meter), so the conversion should be identity.
     - So, the result is -5.0.

6. **No exception is raised, so the result is -5.0.**

7. **Final output**: -5.0
