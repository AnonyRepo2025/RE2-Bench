[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the function step by step:

1. The input `query` is a list of pairs: `[["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]`.
2. The function first checks if `query` is a `MultiValueDict` (it's not), or if it has an `items` attribute (it doesn't, since it's a list).
3. So, it skips those conversions and proceeds to the loop: `for key, value in query:`
   - First iteration: key="a", value=1
     - value is not None, and `doseq` is False (default), and value is not a string or bytes, but since `doseq` is False, it just sets `query_val = value` (so query_val=1).
     - Appends ("a", 1) to `query_params`.
   - Second iteration: key="b", value=2
     - Same logic, appends ("b", 2).
   - Third iteration: key="c", value=3
     - Same logic, appends ("c", 3).
4. Now, `query_params = [("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)]`.
5. Calls `original_urlencode(query_params, doseq)` (which is `urllib.parse.urlencode`).
   - For a list of pairs, `urlencode` will convert numbers to strings and join as "a=1&b=2&c=3".

So, the output will be the string: "a=1&b=2&c=3".
