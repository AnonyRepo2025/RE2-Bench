[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `_mask_nc` with the input `eq = x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n`.

1. The function expects a SymPy expression, not a string. So first, we need to sympify the input string to a SymPy expression. Let's assume that is done:  
   `eq = sympify("x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n")`

2. The function checks if `expr.is_commutative`.  
   - In SymPy, if all symbols are commutative (the default), then the expression is commutative.  
   - Unless `n`, `m`, `o`, or `x` are defined as noncommutative symbols, the expression is commutative.  
   - Since the input does not specify noncommutative symbols, all are commutative by default.

3. Therefore, the function will return `(eq, {}, [])`.

4. The output will be:
   - The original expression (as a SymPy object, but for JSON output, we can use its string representation).
   - An empty dictionary.
   - An empty list.
