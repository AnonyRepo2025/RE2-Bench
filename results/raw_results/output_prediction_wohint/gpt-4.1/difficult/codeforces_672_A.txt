[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The code builds a list `li` by iterating `i` from 1 to 370 (inclusive).
2. For each `i`, it counts the number of digits (`count`).
   - If `count == 1` (i.e., 1-9), it appends `i` directly to `li`.
   - If `count == 2` or `count == 3` (i.e., 10-99 or 100-370), it splits the number into its digits and appends those digits (in order) to `li`.
3. After the loop, it pops the last two elements from `li`.
4. It reads an integer `n` from input and prints `li[n-1]`.

Let's simulate the construction of `li`:

- For i = 1 to 9: li = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
- For i = 10: temp = [1,0], li += [1,0] → li = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,0]
- For i = 11: temp = [1,1], li += [1,1] → li = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,0,1,1]
- Continue this way up to i = 99.
- For i = 100: temp = [1,0,0], li += [1,0,0]
- Continue this way up to i = 370.

So, the list `li` is the sequence of all digits of all numbers from 1 to 370, but for 1-9, the numbers themselves are appended, and for 10-370, their digits are appended.

After the loop, li.pop() and li.pop() remove the last two digits.

Now, the input is 423, so n = 423. The code prints li[422] (since list is 0-indexed).

Let's find what li[422] is.

Let's count the length of li:

- 1-9: 9 elements
- 10-99: 90 numbers, each contributes 2 digits = 180 elements
- 100-370: 271 numbers, each contributes 3 digits = 813 elements

Total before popping: 9 + 180 + 813 = 1002
After popping: 1000 elements

So li has 1000 elements, indexed 0 to 999.

Now, let's find li[422]:

- 1-9: indices 0-8
- 10-99: next 180 elements, indices 9-188
- 100-370: next 813 elements, indices 189-1001

li[422] is in the 100-370 range.

Let's find which number's digit it is.

- Indices for 100-370 start at 189.
- So, li[189] is the first digit of 100.

Each number from 100 onwards contributes 3 digits.

Let k = index in this range: k = 422 - 189 = 233

So, which number and which digit?

Each number: 3 digits
Number of numbers before: 233 // 3 = 77
Digit in number: 233 % 3 = 2 (0-based, so 0=first digit, 1=second, 2=third)

So, the 78th number in this range (since 0-based), and the 3rd digit.

First number is 100, so 100 + 77 = 177

So, number is 177, digit is 3rd digit (i.e., the last digit).

Digits of 177: '1', '7', '7' → third digit is '7'

So, the output is 7.
