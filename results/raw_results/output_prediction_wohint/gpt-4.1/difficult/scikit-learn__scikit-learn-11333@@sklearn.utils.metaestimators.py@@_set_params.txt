[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the execution of `_set_params` with the given input.

- `self` is a dictionary with keys: "transformers", "remainder", "n_jobs", "transformer_weights".
- The method is called as `_set_params(self, attr="_transformers", n_jobs=2)`.

Step-by-step:

1. The method checks if `attr` ("_transformers") is in `params` (which is `{"n_jobs": 2}`).
   - It is not, so nothing happens in the first if block.

2. `items = getattr(self, attr)`:
   - `attr` is "_transformers".
   - `self` is a dict, so `getattr(self, "_transformers")` would fail in real code, but let's assume in the real class, `self` is an object and has an attribute "_transformers".
   - In the context of the code, `_set_params` is meant to be called on a class instance, not a dict. But for this simulation, let's proceed as if `self` is an object with those attributes.

3. `names = []`
   - If `items` is not None, then `names, _ = zip(*items)`.
   - But `items` is likely None (since "transformers" is None and "_transformers" is not present), so `names` remains [].

4. The for loop: `for name in list(six.iterkeys(params))`:
   - `params` is `{"n_jobs": 2}`.
   - So, `name = "n_jobs"`.

   - The if condition: `if '__' not in name and name in names:`
     - "n_jobs" does not contain "__", but `names` is empty, so this is False.
     - So, nothing happens in this loop.

5. The method then calls `super(_BaseComposition, self).set_params(**params)`:
   - This is `BaseEstimator.set_params(self, n_jobs=2)`.

   - In `BaseEstimator.set_params`, it gets `valid_params = self.get_params(deep=True)`.
     - `self.get_params(deep=True)` will return a dict of all parameters, including "n_jobs".
     - "n_jobs" is a valid parameter.

   - For each key, value in params:
     - key = "n_jobs", value = 2
     - Since there is no "__" in the key, it sets `setattr(self, "n_jobs", 2)`.
     - So, `self.n_jobs` is now 2.

6. The method returns `self`.

So, the only change is that `self.n_jobs` is updated from 1 to 2.

Final output: the updated self object, with "n_jobs": 2.
