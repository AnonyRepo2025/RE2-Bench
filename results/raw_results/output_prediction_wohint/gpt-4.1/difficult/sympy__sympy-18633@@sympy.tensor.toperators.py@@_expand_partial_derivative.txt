[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the input and the code step by step.

1. The method being called is `_expand_partial_derivative` on an instance of `PartialDerivative`.
2. The input for `self` only provides `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` as null, and no `args` or `kwargs`. However, the method relies on `self.expr` and `self.variables`, which are properties that access `self.args[0]` and `self.args[1:]` respectively.
3. Since `self.args` is not provided, we must assume that `self.args` is empty or not set, which would mean `self.expr` would raise an IndexError. But let's check what the code would do if `self.args` is empty.

- `self.expr` is `self.args[0]`. If `self.args` is empty, this will raise an IndexError.
- If `self.args` is not empty, but contains something, then `self.expr` is that first argument.

But the input does not provide `args`, so the only possible value is that `self.args` is empty.

Therefore, when `_expand_partial_derivative` is called, the first line is:
```python
args, indices, free, dum = self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)
```
But `self.expr` is `self.args[0]`, which will raise an IndexError.

So, the output will be an exception: IndexError.

Alternatively, if the system is expected to return a value, it would be an error or None.

But based on the code, the only possible output is an exception due to missing `args`.
