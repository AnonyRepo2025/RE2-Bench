[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` method with the given input.

The method signature is:
```python
def _map_drop_idx_to_infrequent(self, feature_idx, drop_idx):
    if not self._infrequent_enabled:
        return drop_idx
    ...
```

From the input, we have:
- `self._infrequent_enabled` = False
- `feature_idx` = 2
- `drop_idx` = "1" (string)

The first line of the method checks if `self._infrequent_enabled` is False. If so, it returns `drop_idx` immediately.

So, since `_infrequent_enabled` is False, the function will return the input `drop_idx` as is, which is the string "1".

No further code is executed.
