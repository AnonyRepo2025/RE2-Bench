[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the `MatrixExpr._eval_Eq` method step by step.

1. The method signature is: `def _eval_Eq(self, other):`
2. The method first checks: `if not isinstance(other, MatrixExpr): return False`
   - The input JSON gives no details about the types of `self` and `other`, but since this method is being called, we can assume both are instances of `MatrixExpr` or its subclasses.
3. Next: `if self.shape != other.shape: return False`
   - The method expects both `self` and `other` to have a `.shape` property.
   - If their shapes are not equal, return False.
   - The input does not specify the shapes, so we must assume they are equal for the method to proceed further.
4. Next: `if (self - other).is_ZeroMatrix: return True`
   - The method computes `self - other` (which uses `__sub__`), and checks if the result is a zero matrix.
   - If so, return True.
   - If not, proceed to the next line.
   - The input does not specify the values, so we cannot know if `self - other` is a zero matrix. But if it is, the method would return True here.
5. Finally: `return Eq(self, other, evaluate=False)`
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the method returns a symbolic equality: `Eq(self, other, evaluate=False)`

Since the input does not specify any details about the shapes or values, and both are empty dicts (which is not realistic for actual `MatrixExpr` objects), but since the method is being called, let's assume:
- Both are `MatrixExpr` instances.
- Their shapes are equal.
- `self - other` is NOT a zero matrix (otherwise the method would return True).

Therefore, the method will return `Eq(self, other, evaluate=False)`.

In SymPy, this is a symbolic equality object, which, when printed, would look like `Eq(self, other, evaluate=False)`.

But since the input is JSON, and the output should be JSON, let's represent the output as a string indicating the symbolic equality.
