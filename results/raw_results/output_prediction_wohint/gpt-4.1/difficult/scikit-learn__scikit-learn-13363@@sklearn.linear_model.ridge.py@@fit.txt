[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the execution of the `fit` method of `_BaseRidge` with the given input.

**Step 1: Input Parsing**
- `X` is a 3x2 numpy array:
  ```
  [[-0.46341769, -0.46572975],
   [ 0.24196227, -1.91328024],
   [-1.72491783, -0.56228753]]
  ```
- `y` is a 1D numpy array of length 3:
  ```
  [-1.01283112, 0.31424733, -0.90802408]
  ```
- `sample_weight` is 2.0 (scalar).

**Step 2: Determine dtype**
- `solver` is "auto", so `_dtype = [np.float64, np.float32]`.

**Step 3: Call check_X_y**
- `check_X_y` is called with:
  - `X` (3x2), `y` (3,), accept_sparse=['csr', 'csc', 'coo'], dtype=[np.float64, np.float32], multi_output=True, y_numeric=True.
- Inside `check_X_y`:
  - `check_array` is called for `X`:
    - `X` is already a 2D numpy array, dtype is float64, so no conversion needed.
    - It passes all checks and is returned as is.
  - `check_array` is called for `y`:
    - `y` is 1D, but since `multi_output=True`, `ensure_2d=False`, so it's accepted as 1D.
    - dtype is float64, so no conversion needed.
    - It passes all checks and is returned as is.
  - `check_consistent_length` is called:
    - Both `X` and `y` have 3 samples, so passes.
- Returns `X` and `y` as numpy arrays.

**Step 4: Preprocessing**
- Calls `self._preprocess_data` with:
  - `X`, `y`, `fit_intercept=True`, `normalize=False`, `copy_X=True`, `sample_weight=2.0`, `return_mean=True`.
- The details of `_preprocess_data` are not given, but typically:
  - It centers `X` and `y` if `fit_intercept=True`.
  - It normalizes `X` if `normalize=True` (not the case here).
  - It returns `X`, `y`, `X_offset`, `y_offset`, `X_scale`.
- Let's assume it returns centered `X` and `y`, and the means as `X_offset` and `y_offset`, and `X_scale` as 1s (since `normalize=False`).

**Step 5: Check for sparse**
- `sparse.issparse(X)` is False (X is dense).
- So, goes to the `else` branch.

**Step 6: Prepare params**
- Since `sparse.issparse(X)` is False, `params = {}`.

**Step 7: Call _ridge_regression**
- Calls `_ridge_regression` with:
  - `X`, `y`, `alpha=1`, `sample_weight=2.0`, `max_iter=None`, `tol=0.001`, `solver="auto"`, `random_state=None`, `return_n_iter=True`, `return_intercept=False`.
- The output is assigned to `self.coef_`, `self.n_iter_`.

**Step 8: Set intercept**
- Calls `self._set_intercept(X_offset, y_offset, X_scale)` to set `self.intercept_`.

**Step 9: Return self**
- Returns the fitted estimator.

**What will be the output?**
- The output of `fit` is always `self` (the estimator instance).
- The values of `coef_`, `n_iter_`, and `intercept_` will be updated.
- However, since the actual implementation of `_ridge_regression` and `_set_intercept` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact new values of `coef_`, `n_iter_`, and `intercept_` without more information.
- But, the output of `fit` is always the estimator instance itself.

**Conclusion:**
- The output is the estimator instance, with updated attributes.
- If we are to output the values of `coef_`, `n_iter_`, and `intercept_`, we would need the implementation of `_ridge_regression` and `_set_intercept`.
- Since the input already has `coef_`, `n_iter_`, and `intercept_`, but these will be overwritten by the fit process.

**If only the return value is required, it is the estimator instance. If the output is the updated attributes, we cannot compute them exactly without more code.**
