[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of process_csv_data(N=1, save_file_name="read_test.csv") step by step.

1. The method calls self.read_csv("read_test.csv").
   - This opens the file "read_test.csv" for reading.
   - Reads the first row as title.
   - Reads the rest of the rows as data (list of lists).

2. Next, it extracts the N-th column (N=1, i.e., the second column) from each row in data:
   column_data = [row[1] for row in data]

3. Then, it uppercases each value in column_data:
   column_data = [row.upper() for row in column_data]

4. It creates new_data = [title, column_data]

5. It writes new_data to a new file named "read_test_process.csv" using write_csv.

6. write_csv returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

7. process_csv_data returns the result of write_csv.

However, we do not know the contents of "read_test.csv". But, the function only returns 1 or 0, depending on whether the write_csv succeeded.

Assuming the file exists and is readable and writable, and there are no exceptions, write_csv will return 1.

Therefore, the output will be 1.
