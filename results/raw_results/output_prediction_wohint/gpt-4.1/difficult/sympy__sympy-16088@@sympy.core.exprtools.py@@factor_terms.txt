[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the execution of `factor_terms(expr, radical=False, clear=False, fraction=False, sign=True)` with input expr = "R3 + R4 + 4050".

1. The first thing `factor_terms` does is call `sympify(expr)`. The input is the string "R3 + R4 + 4050".
   - `sympify` will parse this as a symbolic expression: `R3 + R4 + 4050`, where R3 and R4 are symbols, and 4050 is an integer.

2. Now, `do(expr)` is called on the sympified expression, which is an Add object: `R3 + R4 + 4050`.

3. Inside `do`:
   - `expr` is an Add, which is a subclass of Basic, and not an atom.
   - It is not a Pow, not a Function, not an iterable, and has `args_cnc` (since it's a Mul/Add).
   - So, it proceeds to:
     - `cont, p = expr.as_content_primitive(radical=radical, clear=clear)`
     - For an Add of symbols and a number, `as_content_primitive` will return (1, R3 + R4 + 4050), because there is no common factor in the terms.

4. Now, since `p.is_Add` is True:
   - `list_args = [do(a) for a in Add.make_args(p)]`
     - `Add.make_args(p)` returns the terms: [R3, R4, 4050]
     - For each term:
       - do(R3): R3 is a Symbol, which is an atom, so returns R3.
       - do(R4): returns R4.
       - do(4050): returns 4050.
     - So, list_args = [R3, R4, 4050]
   - The next check is:
     - all((a.as_coeff_Mul()[0].extract_multiplicatively(-1) is not None for a in list_args))
     - For R3: a.as_coeff_Mul()[0] is 1, 1.extract_multiplicatively(-1) is None.
     - For R4: same.
     - For 4050: a.as_coeff_Mul()[0] is 4050, 4050.extract_multiplicatively(-1) is -4050, which is not None.
     - But since not all are not None, this block is skipped.

   - Then, it creates a `special` dict for terms with exponents that are Mul and not equal to Mul(*e.args), but for R3, R4, 4050, this is not the case, so `special` remains empty.

   - `p = Add._from_args(list_args)` just reconstructs the Add: R3 + R4 + 4050

   - `p = gcd_terms(p, isprimitive=True, clear=clear, fraction=fraction).xreplace(special)`
     - `gcd_terms` will try to factor out a GCD from the terms.
     - The terms are R3, R4, 4050. There is no numeric GCD to factor out, so the expression remains R3 + R4 + 4050.

5. Since `p.args` is True, but we've already handled the Add case, this is skipped.

6. `rv = _keep_coeff(cont, p, clear=clear, sign=sign)`
   - cont = 1, p = R3 + R4 + 4050
   - _keep_coeff(1, expr) just returns expr.

7. So, the result is R3 + R4 + 4050.

Therefore, the output is the same as the input, as no factoring is possible.
