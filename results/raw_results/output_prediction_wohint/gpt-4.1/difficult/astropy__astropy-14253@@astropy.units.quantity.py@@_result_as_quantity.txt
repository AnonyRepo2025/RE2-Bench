[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the `_result_as_quantity` method with the given input:

1. The method signature is: `def _result_as_quantity(self, result, unit, out):`
2. The input is:
   - `self` is a Quantity instance with `_unit` set to a "meter" unit.
   - `result` is 11.5 (a float).
   - `unit` is also the "meter" unit (same as self._unit).
   - `out` is None.

3. The method first checks: `if isinstance(result, (tuple, list)):`  
   - `result` is a float, so this is False.

4. Next: `if out is None:`  
   - This is True.

5. Then: `return result if unit is None else self._new_view(result, unit, finalize=False)`

   - `unit` is not None (it's the "meter" unit).
   - So, it returns `self._new_view(result, unit, finalize=False)`

6. What does `self._new_view(result, unit, finalize=False)` do?  
   - In astropy.units.Quantity, `_new_view` creates a new Quantity object from the value, with the given unit.
   - So, it will return a new Quantity object with value 11.5 and unit "meter".

7. The output should be a Quantity object with value 11.5 and unit "meter".

8. In JSON, we can represent this as:
   ```
   {
     "value": 11.5,
     "unit": "m"
   }
   ```
   (assuming the string representation of the unit is "m" for meter)
