[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `_construct_simple` with the given input:

Input:
- coeffs: null (which in Python will be `None`)
- opt: {}

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The function starts by initializing several flags and an empty list:
   ```
   rationals = floats = complexes = algebraics = False
   float_numbers = []
   ```
2. It checks if `opt.extension` is True, but since `opt` is an empty dict, `opt.extension` will raise an AttributeError if accessed. However, in the code, it is accessed as `opt.extension`, which would fail unless `opt` is an object with an `extension` attribute. But in the input, `opt` is just `{}` (a dict), so `opt.extension` will raise an AttributeError.

But let's assume that in the context of this function, `opt` is always an object with an `extension` attribute, or the code would not work at all. Since the input is a dict, the code will fail at `opt.extension`.

But let's check what happens if `coeffs` is `None`:

3. The function then tries to iterate over `coeffs`:
   ```
   for coeff in coeffs:
       ...
   ```
   If `coeffs` is `None`, this will raise a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`.

Therefore, the function will raise a TypeError before doing anything else.

So the output will be an error indicating that 'NoneType' object is not iterable.
