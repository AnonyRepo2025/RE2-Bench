Let's walk through the execution of `TransformedTargetRegressor.fit(X, y)` with the given input.

**Step 1: Initialization**
- `self.regressor` is a LinearRegression instance (with default params).
- `self.transformer` is None.
- `self.func` is sqrt.
- `self.inverse_func` is log.
- `self.check_inverse` is True.

**Step 2: Call to fit(X, y)**
- X is a (100, 10) numpy array (from the string, it's 100 samples, 10 features).
- y is a (100,) numpy array.

**Step 3: y = check_array(y, ...)**
- y is 1D, shape (100,).
- check_array will ensure it's numeric, 1D is allowed (ensure_2d=False).
- y remains shape (100,).

**Step 4: self._training_dim = y.ndim**
- y.ndim = 1, so self._training_dim = 1.

**Step 5: y_2d = y.reshape(-1, 1)**
- y_2d is now (100, 1).

**Step 6: self._fit_transformer(y_2d)**
- Since self.transformer is None, but self.func and self.inverse_func are set, we create a FunctionTransformer with sqrt and log.
- FunctionTransformer(func=sqrt, inverse_func=log, validate=True, check_inverse=True)
- Call .fit(y_2d):
    - _check_input(y_2d): since validate=True, check_array(y_2d) is called, returns (100, 1) array.
    - check_inverse is True and both func/inverse_func are set, so _check_inverse_transform(y_2d) is called:
        - idx_selected = slice(None, None, max(1, 100//100)) = slice(None, None, 1) (so every row).
        - X_round_trip = inverse_transform(transform(y_2d[idx_selected]))
            - transform: applies sqrt to y_2d[idx_selected]
            - inverse_transform: applies log to the result
        - _allclose_dense_sparse(y_2d[idx_selected], X_round_trip): checks if log(sqrt(y)) â‰ˆ y for all y in y_2d.
        - This is NOT true in general (log(sqrt(y)) = 0.5*log(y)), so the check will fail and a warning is issued.
    - fit returns self.

**Step 7: y_trans = self.transformer_.transform(y_2d)**
- Applies sqrt to each y value.
- y_trans is shape (100, 1).

**Step 8: if y_trans.ndim == 2 and y_trans.shape[1] == 1: y_trans = y_trans.squeeze(axis=1)**
- y_trans becomes shape (100,).

**Step 9: self.regressor_ = clone(self.regressor)**
- A new LinearRegression instance is created.

**Step 10: self.regressor_.fit(X, y_trans, **fit_params)**
- LinearRegression is fit on X (100, 10) and y_trans (100,).

**Step 11: return self**
- The fitted TransformedTargetRegressor instance is returned.

**Output**
- The output of fit is the fitted estimator itself (i.e., self).
- In JSON, this is typically represented as a string indicating the class name, or a summary of the estimator.

**Note**
- The main effect is that the regressor is fit to sqrt(y) instead of y.
- A warning is issued because log(sqrt(y)) is not the inverse of sqrt(y) (the check_inverse check fails).

**Summary**
- Output: the fitted TransformedTargetRegressor instance.
- The warning about the functions not being strict inverses is issued, but does not stop execution.
