[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the execution of `OneHotEncoder.transform` with the given input.

1. The input is:
   - self.n_values_ = [2, 3, 4]
   - self.feature_indices_ = [0, 2, 5, 9]
   - self.active_features_ = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
   - self.handle_unknown = "ignore"
   - X = [[4, 1, 1]]

2. The `transform` method calls `_transform_selected`, which will call `self._transform(X)`.

3. In `_transform`:
   - X is checked to be a 2D numpy array of int: X = [[4, 1, 1]]
   - n_samples = 1, n_features = 3
   - indices = self.feature_indices_ = [0, 2, 5, 9]
   - n_values_ = [2, 3, 4]

4. The mask is computed as (X < n_values_).ravel():
   - X = [[4, 1, 1]]
   - n_values_ = [2, 3, 4]
   - X < n_values_ = [[4<2, 1<3, 1<4]] = [[False, True, True]]
   - mask = [False, True, True]

5. Since handle_unknown is "ignore", we do not raise an error for the False mask.

6. column_indices = (X + indices[:-1]).ravel()[mask]
   - indices[:-1] = [0, 2, 5]
   - X + indices[:-1] = [[4+0, 1+2, 1+5]] = [[4, 3, 6]]
   - ravel() = [4, 3, 6]
   - [4, 3, 6][mask] = [3, 6] (since mask is [False, True, True])

7. row_indices = np.repeat(np.arange(n_samples, dtype=np.int32), n_features)[mask]
   - np.arange(1) = [0]
   - repeat for n_features=3: [0, 0, 0]
   - [0, 0, 0][mask] = [0, 0]

8. data = np.ones(np.sum(mask)) = np.ones(2) = [1, 1]

9. out = sparse.coo_matrix((data, (row_indices, column_indices)), shape=(1, indices[-1]), dtype=self.dtype).tocsr()
   - shape = (1, 9) (since indices[-1]=9)
   - data = [1, 1]
   - row_indices = [0, 0]
   - column_indices = [3, 6]
   - So, the matrix has 1 row, 9 columns, with 1s at columns 3 and 6.

10. Since n_values is "auto", we select only active_features_ columns:
    - self.active_features_ = [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
    - So, out = out[:, [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]]

11. The original matrix (1x9) has 1s at columns 3 and 6. After selecting columns [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]:
    - Let's map the original columns to the new indices:
      - 0 -> 0
      - 1 -> 1
      - 2 -> 2
      - 3 -> not selected
      - 4 -> 3
      - 5 -> not selected
      - 6 -> 4
      - 7 -> 5
      - 8 -> 6
    - So, in the new matrix (1x7), the 1s will be at:
      - column 3 (original) is not selected, so that 1 is dropped
      - column 6 (original) is mapped to index 4 in the new matrix

12. Therefore, the output is a sparse matrix of shape (1, 7), with a single 1 at column 4 (0-based).

13. If we convert this to a dense array, it would be: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]

14. But since self.sparse is True, the output is a sparse matrix with shape (1, 7), with a single nonzero at (0, 4).

15. In JSON, we can represent the sparse matrix as:
    - shape: [1, 7]
    - data: [1.0]
    - row: [0]
    - col: [4]

    "shape": [1, 7],
    "data": [1.0],
    "row": [0],
