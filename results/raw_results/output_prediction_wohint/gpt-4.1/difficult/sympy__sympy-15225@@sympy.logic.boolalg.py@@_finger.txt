[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the `_finger` function with the given input.

1. The input `eq` is an object with:
   - `nargs`: {}
   - `_argset`: frozenset({y & ~x, x & ~y})

2. The function starts by getting the free symbols of `eq`:
   - `f = eq.free_symbols`
   - The method `free_symbols` is defined as: `return set().union(*[a.free_symbols for a in self.args])`
   - `self.args` is `tuple(ordered(self._argset))`
   - `_argset` is `frozenset({y & ~x, x & ~y})`
   - So, `ordered(self._argset)` will yield the two elements: `y & ~x` and `x & ~y` (order is not guaranteed, but let's assume the order is as written).

3. For each element in `_argset`, we call `.free_symbols`:
   - Let's assume `y & ~x` has free symbols `{x, y}`
   - Similarly, `x & ~y` has free symbols `{x, y}`
   - So, the union is `{x, y}`

4. Now, `d = dict(list(zip(f, [[0] * 5 for fi in f])))`
   - So, `d = {x: [0,0,0,0,0], y: [0,0,0,0,0]}`

5. Now, for each `a` in `eq.args` (which is the tuple of the two elements):
   - For each `a` in (`y & ~x`, `x & ~y`):

   Let's process `y & ~x`:
   - Is `a.is_Symbol`? No, it's an And operation.
   - Is `a.is_Not`? No.
   - Else:
     - `o = len(a.args) + sum((isinstance(ai, Not) for ai in a.args))`
     - Let's assume `a.args` for `y & ~x` is (`y`, `~x`)
     - len(a.args) = 2
     - For `ai in a.args`:
       - `y` is a Symbol, not a Not
       - `~x` is a Not
     - sum((isinstance(ai, Not) for ai in a.args)) = 1
     - So, o = 2 + 1 = 3
     - For each `ai in a.args`:
       - If `ai.is_Symbol`:
         - For `y`: d[y][2] += 1; d[y][-1] += o
         - So, d[y][2] = 1; d[y][4] = 3
       - If `ai.is_Not`:
         - For `~x`: d[x][3] += 1 (since ai.args[0] is x)
         - So, d[x][3] = 1

   Now, process `x & ~y`:
   - a.args = (`x`, `~y`)
   - o = 2 + 1 = 3
   - For `ai in a.args`:
     - `x` is a Symbol: d[x][2] += 1; d[x][4] += 3
       - d[x][2] = 1; d[x][4] = 3
     - `~y` is a Not: d[y][3] += 1
       - d[y][3] = 1

6. Now, d is:
   - d[x] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]
   - d[y] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]

7. Now, inv = defaultdict(list)
   - For k, v in ordered(d.items()):
     - The two items are (x, [0,0,1,1,3]) and (y, [0,0,1,1,3])
     - So, inv[(0,0,1,1,3)] = [x, y]

8. Return inv

So, the output is a dictionary mapping the tuple (0,0,1,1,3) to a list of [x, y].
