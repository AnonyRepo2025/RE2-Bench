[THOUGHT]
The `__repr__` method in `BaseCrossValidator` calls `_build_repr(self)`. The code for `_build_repr` is not provided in the snippet, but in scikit-learn, `_build_repr` is a utility function that returns a string representation of the estimator/class, including its class name and the values of its parameters.

Given the input, `self` has attributes `test_fold` and `unique_folds`. However, these are not standard parameters of `BaseCrossValidator`, and the class itself does not define an `__init__` or any parameters. In scikit-learn, the default behavior is to print the class name and its parameters (if any).

Assuming `_build_repr(self)` returns something like `ClassName()` if there are no parameters, or `ClassName(param1=value1, param2=value2, ...)` if there are parameters.

Since `BaseCrossValidator` is an abstract class and does not have any parameters, the most likely output is:

'BaseCrossValidator()'

If, however, `_build_repr` includes all attributes (even those not in `__init__`), it might print:

'BaseCrossValidator(test_fold=[1 1 2 2], unique_folds=[1 2])'

But in scikit-learn, only parameters from `__init__` are included, not arbitrary attributes.

Therefore, the output will be:

'BaseCrossValidator()'
