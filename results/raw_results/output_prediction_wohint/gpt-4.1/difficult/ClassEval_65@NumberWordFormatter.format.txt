[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:

1. The input is `x: null` (which is `None` in Python).
2. The `format` method is called with `x=None`.
3. The first line of `format` is:
   ```
   if x is not None:
       return self.format_string(str(x))
   else:
       return ''
   ```
   Since `x` is `None`, the condition `x is not None` is `False`, so the `else` branch is taken.
4. The function returns the empty string `''`.

Therefore, the output will be an empty string.
