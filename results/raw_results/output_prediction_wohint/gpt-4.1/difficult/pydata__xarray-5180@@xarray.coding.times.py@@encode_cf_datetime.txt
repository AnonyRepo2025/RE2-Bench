[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `encode_cf_datetime` with the given input:

Input:
- dates: "2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000"
- units: "days since 2000-01-01"
- calendar: "gregorian"

1. The function first converts `dates` to a numpy array:
   ```python
   dates = np.asarray(dates)
   ```
   Since the input is a string, `np.asarray("2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000")` will produce a 0-dimensional numpy array of dtype `<U29` (unicode string).

2. Next, since `units` is provided, it is cleaned up:
   ```python
   units = _cleanup_netcdf_time_units(units)
   ```
   - `_cleanup_netcdf_time_units("days since 2000-01-01")`:
     - Calls `_unpack_netcdf_time_units("days since 2000-01-01")`:
       - Regex matches, so delta = "days", ref_date = "2000-01-01"
       - Calls `_ensure_padded_year("2000-01-01")`:
         - Regex matches for 4 digits, so returns "2000-01-01"
       - Returns ("days", "2000-01-01")
     - Calls `format_timestamp("2000-01-01")`:
       - Converts to pd.Timestamp("2000-01-01") -> "2000-01-01 00:00:00"
       - Splits into date_str="2000-01-01", time_str="00:00:00"
       - Since time_str is "00:00:00", returns "2000-01-01"
     - Returns "days since 2000-01-01"
   So, units remains "days since 2000-01-01".

3. Since calendar is provided, it is not inferred.

4. Next, `_unpack_netcdf_time_units(units)` is called again:
   - Returns ("days", "2000-01-01")

5. Now, the function tries the "fast" path:
   - `_is_standard_calendar("gregorian")` returns True (since "gregorian" is in _STANDARD_CALENDARS).
   - But, `dates.dtype.kind == 'O'`? Let's check:
     - `dates` is a 0-dim array of string, so `dates.dtype.kind` is 'U' (unicode), not 'O'.
   - Next, `assert dates.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]'`:
     - This will fail, since dtype is 'U' (unicode string), not 'datetime64[ns]'.
   - So, the assertion fails, and an exception is raised, which is caught by the except block.

6. The except block calls `_encode_datetime_with_cftime(dates, units, calendar)`:
   - Inside `_encode_datetime_with_cftime`:
     - Checks if `np.issubdtype(dates.dtype, np.datetime64)`:
       - `dates.dtype` is 'U', so this is False.
     - Defines `encode_datetime(d)`:
       - If d is None, returns np.nan, else returns cftime.date2num(d, units, calendar)
     - Applies this to each element in `dates.ravel()`:
       - `dates.ravel()` is an array with a single string: "2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000"
       - For d = "2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000":
         - d is not None, so calls cftime.date2num(d, units, calendar)
         - But cftime.date2num expects a datetime-like object, not a string.
         - However, in practice, cftime.date2num will try to parse the string as a datetime.
         - Let's assume cftime.date2num can parse ISO8601 strings (which it can).
         - So, cftime.date2num("2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000", "days since 2000-01-01", "gregorian")
           - This should return the number of days between 2000-01-01 and 2000-01-11, which is 10.
     - So, the result is np.array([10.0]) (cftime returns float).

7. The result is reshaped to the shape of dates, which is () (scalar), so the result is scalar 10.0.

8. Next, `cast_to_int_if_safe(num)` is called:
   - num = 10.0
   - int_num = np.array(10.0, dtype=np.int64) = 10
   - (num == int_num).all() is True, so num = int_num = 10

9. The function returns (num, units, calendar):
   - num: 10
   - units: "days since 2000-01-01"
   - calendar: "gregorian"
