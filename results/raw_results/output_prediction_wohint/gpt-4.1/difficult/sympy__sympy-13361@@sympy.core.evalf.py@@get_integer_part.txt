[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `get_integer_part(expr, no, options, return_ints=True)` with the input:

- expr = "1/2" (which is the rational number 1/2)
- no = -1
- options = {}
- return_ints = True

Step 1: The function starts by calling `evalf(expr, assumed_size, options)` with assumed_size=30.

- `evalf("1/2", 30, {})` will evaluate 1/2 numerically to 0.5 (as an mpf).
- Since 1/2 is real and not complex, ire will be the mpf for 0.5, iim will be None.

Step 2: The function checks which of ire/iim are present. Only ire is present, so:

- gap = fastlog(ire) - ire_acc

But since ire is a number, and ire_acc is the precision (30), fastlog(ire) is the bit length of the mantissa of 0.5, which is 1 (since 0.5 = 1/2 = 2^-1, so mantissa is 1, exponent is -1). So fastlog(ire) = 1, ire_acc = 30, so gap = 1 - 30 = -29.

Step 3: margin = 10, so gap >= -margin is -29 >= -10, which is False, so we do not re-evaluate.

Step 4: Now, define calc_part(expr, nexpr):

- nexpr is the mpf for 0.5.
- nint = int(to_int(nexpr, rnd)) = int(0.5) = 0

- n, c, p, b = nexpr
  (mpf is a tuple: sign, man, exp, bc)
- is_int = p == 0 (p is the exponent, but for 0.5, exponent is -1, so is_int = False)

- Since is_int is False, and options.get('subs', False) is False, we skip substitution.

- expr = Add(expr, -nint, evaluate=False) = Add(1/2, 0, evaluate=False) = 1/2

- x, _, x_acc, _ = evalf(expr, 10, options)
  - evalf(1/2, 10, {}) = 0.5 (mpf)
  - x = mpf for 0.5

- try: check_target(expr, (x, None, x_acc, None), 3)
  - Let's assume this passes (since 0.5 is exact).

- nint += int(no * (mpf_cmp(x or fzero, fzero) == no))
  - no = -1
  - mpf_cmp(0.5, 0) == -1? mpf_cmp(0.5, 0) returns 1 (since 0.5 > 0)
  - So (mpf_cmp(x, 0) == no) is (1 == -1) is False, so int(False) = 0
  - nint += 0, so nint = 0

- nint = from_int(nint) = from_int(0) = mpf for 0

- return (nint, INF)

Step 5: Back in get_integer_part, since only ire is present, re_, re_acc = calc_part(re(expr, evaluate=False), ire)

- re_ = mpf for 0

- if return_ints: return (int(to_int(re_ or fzero)), int(to_int(im_ or fzero)))
  - re_ = mpf for 0, im_ = None, so im_ or fzero = fzero
  - int(to_int(re_)) = int(0) = 0
  - int(to_int(im_ or fzero)) = int(0) = 0

So the function returns (0, 0).

This matches the mathematical expectation: the integer part of 1/2, in the direction of -1 (floor), is 0 (since floor(0.5) = 0).
