[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `_mapping_repr` with the given input.

Inputs:
- mapping = {"foo": "bar"}
- title = "Attributes"
- summarizer = {} (but in practice, this should be a function; let's assume it's a function that takes (k, v, col_width) and returns a string, but since it's empty, let's just use str for now)
- expand_option_name = "display_expand_attrs"
- col_width = None
- max_rows = None

Step 1: col_width is None, so call _calculate_col_width(mapping)
- mapping = {"foo": "bar"}
- _calculate_col_width will compute max_name_length = max(len(str(s)) for s in mapping) = len("foo") = 3
- col_width = max(3, 7) + 6 = 7 + 6 = 13

Step 2: max_rows is None, so set max_rows = OPTIONS['display_max_rows']
- We don't know the value of OPTIONS['display_max_rows'], but let's assume the default is 12 (as in xarray).

Step 3: summary = [f'{title}:'] = ["Attributes:"]

Step 4: mapping is not empty, so len_mapping = 1

Step 5: _get_boolean_with_default(expand_option_name, default=True)
- expand_option_name = "display_expand_attrs"
- Let's assume OPTIONS["display_expand_attrs"] is 'default', so returns True.

Step 6: len_mapping = 1, which is not greater than max_rows (12), so go to the else branch:
- summary += [summarizer(k, v, col_width) for k, v in mapping.items()]

But summarizer is given as an empty dict in the input, which is not callable. In real code, this would error, but for the sake of this simulation, let's assume summarizer is a function that returns a string like "    foo: bar" (as xarray does for attributes).

So, summary = ["Attributes:", "    foo: bar"]

Step 7: Return '\n'.join(summary) = "Attributes:\n    foo: bar"

    "result": "Attributes:\n    foo: bar"
