[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `periodicity(f, symbol, check=False)` with the input:

- f = "csc(2*x) - sec(x)"
- symbol = not specified, but by convention, it's likely "x".

First, let's parse f:
- f = csc(2*x) - sec(x)

Assume symbol = x.

Step 1: `orig_f = f`
- orig_f = csc(2*x) - sec(x)

Step 2: `f = simplify(orig_f)`
- This will not change the structure, as csc(2*x) and sec(x) are already simple.

Step 3: `period = None`

Step 4: `if symbol not in f.free_symbols:`
- x is in f.free_symbols, so continue.

Step 5: `if isinstance(f, Relational):`
- f is not a Relational.

Step 6: `if isinstance(f, TrigonometricFunction):`
- f is an Add of two trig functions, not a single trig function.

Step 7: `if isinstance(f, Abs):`
- f is not Abs.

Step 8: `if f.is_Pow:`
- f is not Pow.

Step 9: `elif f.is_Mul:`
- f is not Mul.

Step 10: `elif f.is_Add:`
- f is Add (csc(2*x) + (-sec(x)))

So:
- k, g = f.as_independent(symbol)
- For f = csc(2*x) - sec(x), as_independent(x) will give k=0, g=f.

So, period = _periodicity(g.args, symbol)
- g.args = (csc(2*x), -sec(x))

Now, _periodicity is not shown, but from the context, it likely computes the period of a sum as the least common multiple (lcm) of the periods of the terms.

So, let's compute the period of csc(2*x) and -sec(x):

First, csc(2*x):
- csc is periodic with period pi, but the argument is 2*x, so period is pi/2.

Second, sec(x):
- sec is periodic with period 2*pi, so -sec(x) has the same period, 2*pi.

So, periods:
- csc(2*x): pi
  - But csc(2*x) = 1/sin(2*x), sin(2*x) has period pi, so csc(2*x) has period pi.
- sec(x): 2*pi

But let's check: sin(2*x) has period pi, so csc(2*x) has period pi.

So, periods:
- csc(2*x): pi
- sec(x): 2*pi

Now, the period of the sum is the least common multiple (lcm) of the two periods.

lcm(pi, 2*pi) = 2*pi

So, the period is 2*pi.

Therefore, the output should be 2*pi.
