[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `replace_named_groups` with the input pattern "admin/password_change/done/".

1. The function first uses `named_group_matcher` to find all named groups in the pattern. The regex is `\\(\\?P(<\\w+>)`, which matches the start of a named group in a regex pattern, e.g., `(?P<name>...)`.
2. The input pattern is "admin/password_change/done/", which does not contain any named group patterns (no `(?P<...>...)`).
3. Therefore, `named_group_indices` will be an empty list.
4. The for loop over `named_group_indices` will not execute.
5. The second for loop over `group_pattern_and_name` will also not execute, as it will be empty.
6. The function returns the original pattern unchanged.

So, the output will be the same as the input pattern: "admin/password_change/done/".
