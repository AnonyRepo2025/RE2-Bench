[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `sympify` with input `a = "{2.0, 3}"`.

1. The function first checks if `a` has a `__sympy__` attribute set to True or not None. Since `a` is a string, it does not.
2. It checks if `a` is an instance of `CantSympify` (not defined here, but `a` is a string, so no).
3. It gets the class of `a`, which is `str`.
4. It looks for a converter for `str` in the `converter` dict, but `converter` is empty.
5. It iterates through the MRO of `str` to look for a converter, but finds none.
6. It checks if `a` is `None`, which it is not.
7. It checks if `a` is a numpy instance, which it is not.
8. It checks for a `_sympy_` attribute, which `str` does not have.
9. It checks for a `flat` attribute, which `str` does not have.
10. It checks if `a` is not a string. It is a string, so this block is skipped.
11. It checks if `strict` is True. It is not.
12. It checks if `a` is iterable. Strings are iterable, but this block is only for non-strings (since it is inside `if not isinstance(a, str)`).
13. It checks if `a` is not a string. It is a string, so this block is skipped.
14. Now, it proceeds to the parsing block.

- It sets up `transformations = standard_transformations`.
- `rational` and `convert_xor` are False and True by default, so it adds `t_convert_xor` to transformations.
- It tries to parse the string with `parse_expr`.

The string is `"{2.0, 3}"`. In SymPy, curly braces are not standard for sets, but `parse_expr` can sometimes parse them as `FiniteSet`.

So, `parse_expr("{2.0, 3}")` will return `FiniteSet(2.0, 3)`.

Therefore, the output will be a SymPy `FiniteSet` containing 2.0 and 3.

Assuming the output is stringified as `"FiniteSet(2.0, 3)"`.
