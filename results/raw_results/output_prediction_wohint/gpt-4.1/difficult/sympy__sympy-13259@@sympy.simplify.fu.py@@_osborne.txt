[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `_osborne(e, d)` with the input `e = 2*sinh(2)` and only one argument is provided, so `d` is missing. But in the code, `_osborne` is always called with two arguments, so let's assume `d=1` (the default for such transforms).

1. The function `_osborne(e, d)` returns `bottom_up(e, f)`, where `f` is a function that, if the input is a HyperbolicFunction, transforms it to a trigonometric function according to the rules:
   - sinh(a) -> I*sin(a*d)
   - cosh(a) -> cos(a*d)
   - tanh(a) -> I*tan(a*d)
   - etc.

2. The input `e` is `"2*sinh(2)"`, which is a string. In SymPy, we need to parse it to an expression. So, `e = sympify("2*sinh(2)")` gives `2*sinh(2)`.

3. Now, `bottom_up(e, f)` will traverse the expression tree from the bottom up, applying `f` to each subexpression.

4. The expression tree for `2*sinh(2)` is a Mul node with args (2, sinh(2)). It will first process `2` (which is not a HyperbolicFunction), then `sinh(2)`.

5. For `sinh(2)`, `f` will match `isinstance(rv, HyperbolicFunction)` as True, so:
   - a = 2
   - d = 1
   - a * d = 2
   - rv.func is sinh, so return I * sin(a) = I * sin(2)

6. So, `sinh(2)` is replaced by `I*sin(2)`, so the whole expression becomes `2 * I * sin(2)`.

7. Therefore, the output is `2*I*sin(2)`.
