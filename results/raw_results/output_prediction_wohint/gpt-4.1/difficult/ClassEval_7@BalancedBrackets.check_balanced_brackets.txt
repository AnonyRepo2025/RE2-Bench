[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution step by step.

1. The object is initialized with:
   - stack = ["["]
   - expr = "[(){}"
   - left_brackets = ["(", "{", "["]
   - right_brackets = [")", "}", "]"]

2. check_balanced_brackets() is called.

3. First, clear_expr() is called:
   - It filters expr to only include characters in left_brackets or right_brackets.
   - expr = "[(){}" â†’ all characters are brackets, so expr remains "[(){}".

4. Now, iterate over each character in expr:
   - Initial stack: ["["]

   a) Brkt = "["
      - It's a left bracket, so append to stack.
      - stack: ["[", "["]

   b) Brkt = "("
      - It's a left bracket, so append to stack.
      - stack: ["[", "[", "("]

   c) Brkt = ")"
      - It's a right bracket.
      - Pop from stack: Current_Brkt = "("
      - Current_Brkt == "(", Brkt == ")", so OK.
      - stack: ["[", "["]

   d) Brkt = "{"
      - It's a left bracket, so append to stack.
      - stack: ["[", "[", "{"]

   e) Brkt = "}"
      - It's a right bracket.
      - Pop from stack: Current_Brkt = "{"
      - Current_Brkt == "{", Brkt == "}", so OK.
      - stack: ["[", "["]

5. After the loop, check if stack is empty.
   - stack: ["[", "["]
   - Stack is not empty, so return False.

Therefore, the output is False.
