Let's step through the `_get_kernel_params` method for the given input.

1. The method starts by assigning `params = self.kernel_params`. In this case, `self.kernel_params` is `null` (i.e., `None` in Python).
2. Since `params` is `None`, it is set to an empty dictionary: `params = {}`.
3. Next, the method checks: `if not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed':`
   - `self.kernel` is `"polynomial"`, which is a string, so it is not callable, and it is not `"precomputed"`. So this block is entered.
4. The method then iterates over `KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel]`. 
   - `KERNEL_PARAMS` is a dictionary mapping kernel names to lists of parameter names. For `"polynomial"`, the typical parameters are `["gamma", "coef0", "degree"]`.
5. For each parameter in `["gamma", "coef0", "degree"]`, the method checks if `getattr(self, param)` is not `None`, and if so, adds it to `params`.
   - For `"gamma"`, `self.gamma` is `None`, so it is skipped.
   - For `"coef0"`, `self.coef0` is `0.1`, which is not `None`, so `params["coef0"] = 0.1`.
   - For `"degree"`, `self.degree` is `3.1`, which is not `None`, so `params["degree"] = 3.1`.
6. The method then returns `params`, which is now `{"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}`.

So, the output will be:
```
{
    "coef0": 0.1,
    "degree": 3.1
}
```
