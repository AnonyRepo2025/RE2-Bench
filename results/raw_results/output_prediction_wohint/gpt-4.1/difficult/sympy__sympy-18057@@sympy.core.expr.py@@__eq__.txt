[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the `Expr.__eq__` method with `self` as an `Expr` instance and `other` as the string `"picoweber"`.

1. The method first tries to `_sympify(other)`. This calls `sympify("picoweber", strict=True)`.
2. In `sympify`, since `"picoweber"` is a string and not a known SymPy object, it will try to parse it as a SymPy expression.
3. The parsing will fail because `"picoweber"` is not a valid SymPy expression, so `sympify` will raise a `SympifyError`.
4. The `except (SympifyError, SyntaxError)` block in `Expr.__eq__` will catch this and return `False`.

Therefore, the output will be `False`.
