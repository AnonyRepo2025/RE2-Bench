[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the `_setup` method of the `Nominal` class with the given input.

1. **Copy self**:  
   `new = copy(self)`  
   This creates a shallow copy of the input self dict. So `new` has the same fields as self.

2. **Tick and label params**:  
   Both `_tick_params` and `_label_params` are `None`, so:  
   - `new = new.tick()` (assume this sets `_tick_params` to something non-None)
   - `new = new.label()` (assume this sets `_label_params` to something non-None)

3. **Stringify**:  
   `stringify = np.vectorize(format, otypes=['object'])`  
   This is a function to convert values to string.

4. **units_seed**:  
   `units_seed = categorical_order(data, new.order)`  
   - `data` is a pandas Series with name "x".  
   - `new.order` is `None`.  
   - `categorical_order(data, None)` returns the unique values in data, in order of appearance.  
   - Since the actual data values are not given, but only the structure, let's assume `units_seed` is a list of the unique values in `data`.

5. **CatScale**:  
   Defines a class `CatScale(mpl.scale.LinearScale)` with a `name` attribute and a stub method.  
   Then:  
   `mpl_scale = CatScale(data.name)`  
   So `mpl_scale` is a CatScale instance with name "x".

6. **Axis**:  
   If `axis` is None (it is), then:  
   - `axis = PseudoAxis(mpl_scale)`  
   - `axis.set_view_interval(0, len(units_seed) - 1)`  
   So axis is a PseudoAxis with the CatScale, and its view interval is set.

7. **Set matplotlib scale**:  
   `new._matplotlib_scale = mpl_scale`

8. **Update axis units**:  
   `axis.update_units(stringify(np.array(units_seed)))`  
   - This converts `units_seed` to a numpy array, stringifies it, and updates axis units.

9. **convert_units function**:  
   - This function takes an array `x`, checks which elements are in `units_seed`, and for those, calls `axis.convert_units(stringify(x[keep]))`, and fills the output array accordingly.

10. **Set pipeline**:  
    `new._pipeline = [convert_units, prop.get_mapping(new, data)]`  
    - `prop.get_mapping(new, data)` is called, but we don't know its output, but it's not relevant for the structure.

11. **spacer**:  
    `new._spacer = spacer` (a function that returns 1)

12. **legend**:  
    If `prop.legend` is true, set `new._legend = (units_seed, list(stringify(units_seed)))`  
    - We don't know if `prop.legend` is true. But in the input, `prop` is `{"variable": "objectproperty"}`.  
    - So `prop.legend` is likely not set, so this block is skipped.

13. **Return**:  
    `return new`

**Summary**:  
- The returned object is a copy of self, with:
  - `_tick_params` and `_label_params` set (by tick() and label())
  - `_matplotlib_scale` set to a CatScale instance with name "x"
  - `_pipeline` set to a list of two functions
  - `_spacer` set to a function
  - `_legend` unchanged (still None)
  - All other fields as in self

**Output**:  
The output is the new object, with the above fields. Since the input is a dict, the output should be a dict with updated fields.

Assume:
- `_tick_params` and `_label_params` are now not None (let's use "set" as placeholder)
- `_matplotlib_scale` is a CatScale instance with name "x" (let's represent as {"CatScale": "x"})
- `_pipeline` is a list of two functions (let's represent as ["convert_units", "mapping"])
- `_spacer` is a function (let's represent as "spacer")
- `_legend` is still None
