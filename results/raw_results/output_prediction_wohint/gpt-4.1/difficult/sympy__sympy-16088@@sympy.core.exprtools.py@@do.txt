[THOUGHT]
Let's break down the input and the function step by step.

1. **Input Expression**:  
   The input is a string:  
   ```
   -("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3) + "sqrt(3)"*I*("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3)
   ```
   But in the context of SymPy, the input to `factor_terms` should be a SymPy expression, not a string.  
   Let's assume the input is already parsed as a SymPy expression:
   ```
   - (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
   ```

2. **factor_terms** calls `do(expr)` on the sympified input.

3. **do(expr)**:
   - Checks if `expr` is iterable (it's not, it's an Add).
   - Checks if `expr` is a Basic and not an Atom (it's an Add, so yes).
   - Checks if `expr.is_Pow` or `expr.is_Function` or iterable or not hasattr(expr, 'args_cnc'):
     - `expr` is an Add, so it has `args_cnc`.
     - So, it does not enter this branch.
   - Checks if `expr` is a Sum or Integral (it's not).
   - Calls `expr.as_content_primitive(radical=radical, clear=clear)`:
     - For an Add, this factors out the GCD of the coefficients.
     - In this case, the two terms are:
       1. `- (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`
       2. `sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`
     - The GCD of the coefficients is 1, so content = 1, primitive = the original Add.

4. Since `p.is_Add` is True, it does:
   - `list_args = [do(a) for a in Add.make_args(p)]`
     - For each term:
       - First term: `- (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`
         - It's a Mul: -1 * (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
         - `do` is called on this Mul.
           - It's a Mul, so as_content_primitive is called:
             - For -1: as_content_primitive returns (-1, 1)
             - For (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3): as_content_primitive returns (1, (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3))
             - So, content = -1, primitive = (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
             - Since primitive is not Add, it returns Mul(-1, (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3))
         - So, first term remains `- (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`
       - Second term: `sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`
         - It's a Mul: sqrt(3) * I * (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
         - as_content_primitive:
           - sqrt(3): (sqrt(3), 1)
           - I: (I, 1)
           - (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3): (1, (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3))
           - content = sqrt(3) * I, primitive = (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
           - Returns Mul(sqrt(3)*I, (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3))
         - So, second term remains `sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`
   - Now, `list_args` is the same as the original terms.

5. Next, it checks if all terms have a factor of -1:
   - For first term: as_coeff_Mul()[0] is -1
   - For second term: as_coeff_Mul()[0] is sqrt(3)*I (not negative)
   - So, not all terms have a factor of -1.

6. The "special" handling for exponents is not triggered.

7. It calls `gcd_terms(p, isprimitive=True, clear=clear, fraction=fraction)`, but since the terms have no common factor, the expression remains unchanged.

8. The result is returned as the original expression.

**Conclusion:**  
The output of `do(expr)` is the same as the input expression, i.e.:
```
- (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
```
