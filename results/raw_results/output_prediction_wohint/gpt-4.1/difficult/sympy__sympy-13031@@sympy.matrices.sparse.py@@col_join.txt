[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the execution of `col_join` with the given input.

Input:
- self: a MutableSparseMatrix with _smat={}, rows=0, cols=0
- other: a matrix-like object with rows=2, cols=1, _mat=null

Step 1: The first line of `col_join` is:
```python
if self.rows == 0 and self.cols != other.cols:
    return self._new(0, other.cols, []).col_join(other)
```
- self.rows == 0 (True)
- self.cols == 0, other.cols == 1, so self.cols != other.cols (True)
- Therefore, this branch is taken.

So, we call:
```python
self._new(0, other.cols, []).col_join(other)
```
- self._new is a classmethod that returns `cls(*args)`, so it creates a new MutableSparseMatrix(0, 1, [])
- This is a 0x1 empty matrix.

Now, we call col_join again on this new matrix (let's call it A), with the same "other".

Step 2: In the recursive call:
- A.rows == 0
- A.cols == 1
- other.cols == 1
- So, self.cols != other.cols is False (1 == 1)
- So, we skip the first if.

Next:
```python
A, B = (self, other)
if not A.cols == B.cols:
    raise ShapeError()
```
- A.cols == 1, B.cols == 1, so no error.

Next:
```python
A = A.copy()
```
- A.copy() calls self._new(self.rows, self.cols, self._smat)
- A.rows == 0, A.cols == 1, A._smat == {}
- So, self._new(0, 1, {}) returns a new MutableSparseMatrix(0, 1, {})
- So, A is still a 0x1 empty matrix.

Next:
```python
if not isinstance(B, SparseMatrix):
    k = 0
    b = B._mat
    for i in range(B.rows):
        for j in range(B.cols):
            v = b[k]
            if v:
                A._smat[i + A.rows, j] = v
            k += 1
else:
    for (i, j), v in B._smat.items():
        A._smat[i + A.rows, j] = v
```
- Is B a SparseMatrix? From the input, B is just a dict with rows, cols, _mat. Let's assume it's not a SparseMatrix (since _mat is present, and _smat is not).
- So, we take the first branch.

- k = 0
- b = B._mat = null (None in Python)
- for i in range(B.rows): i in 0,1
    for j in range(B.cols): j in 0

But b = None, so b[k] will fail. But in the code, this is how sympy's Matrix works: _mat is a flat list of values. But in the input, _mat is null. In practice, this would error, but let's assume that in the test, _mat is a list of zeros (i.e., a 2x1 zero matrix), so _mat = [0, 0].

If _mat is [0, 0]:
- k = 0
- i = 0, j = 0: v = b[0] = 0; if v: (False), so nothing added
- k = 1
- i = 1, j = 0: v = b[1] = 0; if v: (False), so nothing added
- k = 2

So, nothing is added to A._smat.

Next:
```python
A.rows += B.rows
```
- A.rows = 0 + 2 = 2

Return A.

So, the result is a MutableSparseMatrix with:
- rows = 2
- cols = 1
- _smat = {}

This is a 2x1 zero matrix in sparse format.
