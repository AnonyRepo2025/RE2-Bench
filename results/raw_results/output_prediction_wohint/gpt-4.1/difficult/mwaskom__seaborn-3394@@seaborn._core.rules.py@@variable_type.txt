[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function with the given input.

1. The input is a pandas Series (as indicated by the internal attributes like `_mgr`, `_item_cache`, etc.), but the actual data is not shown. However, the function only uses the Series' dtype and its values.

2. The function signature is:
   variable_type(vector: Series, boolean_type='numeric', strict_boolean=False)

   The input sets boolean_type="boolean".

3. First, it checks:
   if isinstance(getattr(vector, 'dtype', None), pd.CategoricalDtype):
   - We don't know the dtype, but unless the Series is categorical, this will be False.

4. Next:
   if pd.isna(vector).all():
   - If all values are NA, return VarType('numeric').
   - We don't know the data, but unless all values are NA, this will be False.

5. Then:
   vector = vector.dropna()
   - Drops NA values.

6. With warnings suppressed, it checks strict_boolean (which is False), so it does:
   boolean_vector = bool(np.isin(vector, [0, 1]).all())
   - This checks if all values in the vector are either 0 or 1.

   But since the actual data is not provided, we have to assume the default for a new Series with no data is an empty Series.

   In pandas, if you create an empty Series, np.isin(vector, [0, 1]).all() returns True (since .all() of an empty array is True).

   Therefore, boolean_vector = True.

7. Since boolean_vector is True, it returns VarType(boolean_type), which is VarType('boolean').

So the output will be a VarType object with value 'boolean'. The actual output format is not specified, but likely the string representation of VarType('boolean'), or a dict with its value.

Assuming VarType is a class that stores the type as a string, the output would be:

{"value": "boolean"}
