[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function with the given input.

1. **Inputs**:
   - y_true: "[0 0 0 ... 1 1 1 ... 2 2 2 2]" (as a string, but it's a numpy array of integers)
   - y_pred: "[0 0 0 ... 1 1 1 ... 2 2 2 2]" (same)
   - labels: None
   - sample_weight: None

2. **Convert y_true and y_pred to numpy arrays**:
   - Both are 1D arrays of length 100 (let's count to be sure).
   - Let's count the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s in y_true and y_pred.

   From the input, y_true:
   - 0s: up to index 39 (0-39, 40 elements)
   - 1s: index 40-89 (50 elements)
   - 2s: index 90-93 (4 elements)
   So, y_true: [0]*40 + [1]*50 + [2]*4 = 94 elements? Wait, let's check the count.

   Let's count the numbers in the string:
   - 0s: up to index 39 (0-39, 40 elements)
   - 1s: index 40-89 (50 elements)
   - 2s: index 90-93 (4 elements)
   Total: 40 + 50 + 4 = 94 elements.

   But y_pred is the same length.

3. **_check_targets**:
   - Both y_true and y_pred are 1D arrays of integers.
   - type_of_target(y_true) and type_of_target(y_pred) will both be 'multiclass' (since there are 3 unique values: 0, 1, 2).
   - So y_type = 'multiclass'.
   - y_true and y_pred are already 1D arrays.

4. **labels**:
   - labels is None, so unique_labels(y_true, y_pred) is called.
   - unique_labels will return np.array([0, 1, 2]).

5. **sample_weight**:
   - sample_weight is None, so it's set to np.ones(y_true.shape[0], dtype=np.int64).
   - y_true.shape[0] = 94, so sample_weight is an array of 94 ones.

6. **label_to_ind**:
   - {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}

7. **y_pred and y_true mapping**:
   - Both are already in the correct label indices (0, 1, 2).

8. **ind**:
   - ind = np.logical_and(y_pred < 3, y_true < 3)
   - All values are 0, 1, or 2, so ind is all True.

9. **cm calculation**:
   - coo_matrix((sample_weight, (y_true, y_pred)), shape=(3, 3), dtype=np.int64).toarray()
   - For each (y_true[i], y_pred[i]), increment the corresponding cell by 1.

Let's build the confusion matrix step by step.

- Initialize a 3x3 matrix of zeros.

For i in range(94):
   - y_true[i], y_pred[i]

Let's break down the counts:

**First 40 elements (i=0 to 39):**
- y_true = 0
- y_pred = 0 (from the y_pred string, first 20 are 0, then next 20 are 1)
  Let's check the y_pred string:
  - "[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...]"
  - So, first 20 are 0, next 20 are 1.

So:
- i=0 to 19: y_true=0, y_pred=0 → cm[0,0] += 20
- i=20 to 39: y_true=0, y_pred=1 → cm[0,1] += 20

**Next 50 elements (i=40 to 89):**
- y_true = 1
- y_pred: Let's check the y_pred string at these indices.
  - y_pred[40] = 0
  - y_pred[41] = 0
  - y_pred[42] = 0
  - y_pred[43] = 0
  - y_pred[44] = 0
  - y_pred[45] = 0
  - y_pred[46] = 0
  - y_pred[47] = 0
  - y_pred[48] = 0
  - y_pred[49] = 0
  - y_pred[50] = 1
  - y_pred[51] = 1
  - ... (from 50 onwards, looks like 1s)

From the y_pred string:
- y_pred[40:50] = 0 (10 elements)
- y_pred[50:90] = 1 (40 elements)

So:
- i=40 to 49: y_true=1, y_pred=0 → cm[1,0] += 10
- i=50 to 89: y_true=1, y_pred=1 → cm[1,1] += 40

**Last 4 elements (i=90 to 93):**
- y_true = 2
- y_pred = 2 (from the y_pred string, last 4 elements are 2)
- So cm[2,2] += 4

**Summary:**
- cm[0,0] = 20
- cm[0,1] = 20
- cm[0,2] = 0
- cm[1,0] = 10
- cm[1,1] = 40
- cm[1,2] = 0
- cm[2,0] = 0
- cm[2,1] = 0
- cm[2,2] = 4

So the confusion matrix is:
[[20, 20, 0],
 [10, 40, 0],
 [ 0,  0, 4]]

10. **Normalization**:
- normalize is None, so no normalization.

11. **Return**:
- Return the confusion matrix as a numpy array.

[Note: The input arrays are length 94, not 100 as I initially guessed.]
