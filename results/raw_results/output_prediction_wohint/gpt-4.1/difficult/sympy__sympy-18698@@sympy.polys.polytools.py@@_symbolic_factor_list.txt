[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `_symbolic_factor_list(expr, opt, method)` with the given input:

- expr: "x + 4" (as a string)
- opt: {} (empty dict)
- method: "factor"

1. The function starts by initializing `coeff = S.One` and `factors = []`.
2. It then calls `Mul.make_args(expr)`. Since expr is "x + 4", which is not a Mul, `make_args` will return `(sympify(expr),)`.
3. `sympify("x + 4")` will parse the string into a SymPy expression: `x + 4`.
4. So, `args = [x + 4]`.

Now, for each arg in args:
- arg = x + 4
- `arg.is_Number` is False.
- `arg.is_Pow` is False.
- So, `base, exp = (arg, S.One)`.

Now, try:
- `poly, _ = _poly_from_expr(base, opt)`
  - `_poly_from_expr("x + 4", opt)`:
    - sympify("x + 4") -> x + 4
    - expr is not Poly, so it tries to expand if opt.expand is True (default True).
    - `_dict_from_expr(x + 4, opt)` will extract the dict representation: { (1,): 1, (0,): 4 } for variable x.
    - opt.gens is set to (x,)
    - opt.domain is set to ZZ (integers)
    - poly = Poly(x + 4, x, domain=ZZ)
- Now, `func = getattr(poly, "factor_list")`
- `_coeff, _factors = poly.factor_list()`
  - For Poly(x + 4, x), factor_list() returns (1, [(x + 4, 1)]) (since x + 4 is irreducible over the integers).
- `_coeff is S.One` (1), so nothing is done to coeff.
- Since exp is S.One, `factors.extend(_factors)`, so factors = [(x + 4, 1)].

After the loop, since method != 'sqf', we skip the special case.

Return (coeff, factors) = (1, [(x + 4, 1)])

So the output is:
{
  "coeff": 1,
  "factors": [["x + 4", 1]]
}

But in SymPy, the factor is an expression, not a string. But since the input was a string, and the output is in JSON, we can represent the factor as "x + 4".
