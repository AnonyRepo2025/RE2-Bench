[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the `_setup` method with the given input.

1. **Copy self**:  
   `new = copy(self)`  
   This creates a shallow copy of the input `self` dictionary/object.

2. **Tick and label params**:  
   `if new._tick_params is None: new = new.tick()`  
   In input, `_tick_params` is not None, so this is skipped.  
   `if new._label_params is None: new = new.label()`  
   In input, `_label_params` is None, so `new = new.label()` is called.  
   We don't have the implementation of `label()`, but likely it sets `_label_params` to something not None.

3. **Get transform**:  
   `forward, inverse = new._get_transform()`  
   We don't have the implementation, but since `trans` is "log", likely `forward` is log-transform, `inverse` is exp-transform.

4. **Get scale**:  
   `mpl_scale = new._get_scale(str(data.name), forward, inverse)`  
   `data.name` is "x", so this is called with "x", forward, inverse.

5. **Axis**:  
   `if axis is None: axis = PseudoAxis(mpl_scale); axis.update_units(data)`  
   `axis` is None, so a `PseudoAxis` is created and `update_units(data)` is called.

6. **Set default locators and formatters**:  
   `mpl_scale.set_default_locators_and_formatters(axis)`  
   This is called.

7. **Store scale**:  
   `new._matplotlib_scale = mpl_scale`

8. **Normalization**:  
   `if prop.normed:`  
   The input `prop` only has `variable: "coordinate"`, so `prop.normed` is likely False or not set.  
   So, `normalize = vmin = vmax = None`.

9. **Pipeline**:  
   `new._pipeline = [axis.convert_units, forward, normalize, prop.get_mapping(new, data)]`  
   So, pipeline is a list of 4 callables:  
   - axis.convert_units  
   - forward  
   - None  
   - prop.get_mapping(new, data)  
   (The third is None because normalize is None.)

10. **Spacer**:  
    `def spacer(x): ...`  
    `new._spacer = spacer`

11. **Legend**:  
    `if prop.legend:`  
    The input `prop` does not have `legend`, so this is skipped.

12. **Return**:  
    `return new`

**What is the output?**  
The output is the new object, which is a copy of self, but with:  
- `_label_params` set (by `label()`)  
- `_matplotlib_scale` set  
- `_pipeline` set as above  
- `_spacer` set  
- `_legend` remains None (since prop.legend is not set)  

Since the input and output are in JSON, and the function returns a (dataclass-like) object, the output should be a dict with the updated fields.

**Summary of changes:**  
- `_label_params`: now not None (set by `label()`)  
- `_matplotlib_scale`: set (but we don't know the exact value, so can be a placeholder)  
- `_pipeline`: list of 4 callables (can be described as such)  
- `_spacer`: set (can be described as a function)  
- `_legend`: remains None

**Assumptions:**  
- The output is a dict with these fields.  
- The values for callables and objects can be described as placeholders.
