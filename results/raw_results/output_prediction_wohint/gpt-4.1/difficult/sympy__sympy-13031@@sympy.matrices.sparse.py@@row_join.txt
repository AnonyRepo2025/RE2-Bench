Let's step through the execution of `row_join` with the given input.

Input:
- self: a MutableSparseMatrix with 2 rows and 0 columns, and an empty _smat (no nonzero entries).
- other: a matrix with 2 rows and 1 column, and _mat is null (not specified).

Step 1: The first line of `row_join` is:
```python
if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:
    return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)
```
But here, self.cols == 0 and self.rows == other.rows (both 2), so this block is skipped.

Step 2: Next:
```python
A, B = (self, other)
if not A.rows == B.rows:
    raise ShapeError()
```
A.rows == B.rows == 2, so no error.

Step 3: 
```python
A = A.copy()
```
So we call self.copy(). For SparseMatrix.copy:
```python
def copy(self):
    return self._new(self.rows, self.cols, self._smat)
```
So, _new is called with (2, 0, self._smat), which is an empty dict. So A is a new MutableSparseMatrix with 2 rows, 0 cols, and empty _smat.

Step 4: 
```python
if not isinstance(B, SparseMatrix):
    k = 0
    b = B._mat
    for i in range(B.rows):
        for j in range(B.cols):
            v = b[k]
            if v:
                A._smat[i, j + A.cols] = v
            k += 1
else:
    for (i, j), v in B._smat.items():
        A._smat[i, j + A.cols] = v
```
But in the input, other is not a SparseMatrix (since _mat is present, not _smat), so we take the first branch.

- k = 0
- b = B._mat, but B._mat is null (None). This is a problem: in real code, B._mat would be a flat list of values, but here it's not specified.

But let's assume that B is a dense matrix with all zeros (since _mat is None), or perhaps with all zeros except possibly some values. But since _mat is None, the for loop will try to access b[k], which will fail. But in the context of this question, perhaps the intention is that B is a 2x1 zero matrix.

So, for i in range(2):
    for j in range(1):
        v = b[k]  # b is None, so this would error in real code.

But since _mat is None, let's assume all values are zero, so v is always 0, so the if v: block is never entered, and A._smat remains empty.

Step 5: 
```python
A.cols += B.cols
```
A.cols was 0, B.cols is 1, so A.cols becomes 1.

Step 6: 
```python
return A
```
So the result is a MutableSparseMatrix with:
- rows: 2
- cols: 1
- _smat: {}

So the output is a 2x1 sparse matrix with all zeros (no nonzero entries).
