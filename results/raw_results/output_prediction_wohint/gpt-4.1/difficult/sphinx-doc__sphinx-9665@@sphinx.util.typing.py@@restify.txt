[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `restify` with `cls = None`.

1. The function starts by importing `inspect` from `sphinx.util`.
2. The first condition is: `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`. Here, `cls` is `None`, so this condition is True.
3. The function returns the string `':py:obj:`None`'`.

No further code is executed, and no exceptions are raised.

Therefore, the output will be the string `':py:obj:`None`'`.
