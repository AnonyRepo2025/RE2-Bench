[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:
1. The URLHandler is initialized with url = "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#aaa".
2. get_fragment() is called.
3. fragment_start = self.url.find('#') → finds the index of '#' in the string.
   - In the URL, '#' is at position 39 (counting from 0).
4. Since fragment_start != -1, we return self.url[fragment_start + 1:] → self.url[40:]
5. self.url[40:] is the substring starting after the '#' character, which is "aaa".
6. So, the output will be "aaa".
