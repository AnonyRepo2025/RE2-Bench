[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `triangle_area(a, h)` takes two arguments: `a` (the base of the triangle) and `h` (the height of the triangle).
2. The formula used is: area = (a * h) / 2.0
3. From the input, `a = 10` and `h = 8`.
4. Compute the area:
   - a * h = 10 * 8 = 80
   - 80 / 2.0 = 40.0
5. The function returns 40.0.
