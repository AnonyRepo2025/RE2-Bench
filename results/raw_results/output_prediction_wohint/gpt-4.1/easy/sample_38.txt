[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f`:

1. The input string is "1oE-err bzz-bmm".
2. The function first applies `string.title()`. The `title()` method capitalizes the first letter of each word (where "word" is defined as a sequence separated by whitespace or certain punctuation), and lowercases the rest.
   - "1oE-err bzz-bmm".title() will process as follows:
     - "1oE-err" is considered one word, so the first character "1" is not a letter, so it remains "1". The next character "o" is capitalized to "O", and the rest "E-err" is lowercased to "e-Err" (but actually, title() will capitalize after hyphens too).
     - Let's check how title() works with hyphens:
       - "1oE-err".title() → "1Oe-Err"
       - "bzz-bmm".title() → "Bzz-Bmm"
     - So the whole string: "1oE-err bzz-bmm".title() → "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm"
3. Next, `.replace(' ', '')` removes all spaces.
   - "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm" → "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"

So the final output is "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm".
