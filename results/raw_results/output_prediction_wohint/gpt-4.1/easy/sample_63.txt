[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step.

The function `f(text, prefix)` does the following:
- While `text` starts with `prefix`, it removes the prefix from the start of `text`.
- If removing the prefix results in an empty string, it keeps the empty string (because of `or text`).

Given input:
- text = "ndbtdabdahesyehu"
- prefix = "n"

Step 1:
- Does "ndbtdabdahesyehu" start with "n"? Yes.
- Remove "n" from the start: "dbtdabdahesyehu"

Step 2:
- Does "dbtdabdahesyehu" start with "n"? No.

So the loop stops.

Return value: "dbtdabdahesyehu"
