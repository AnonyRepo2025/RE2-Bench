[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with input `text = "scala"`.

1. `ls = text[::-1]` reverses the string. So:
   - "scala" reversed is "alacs"
   - So, `ls = "alacs"`

2. `text2 = ''` initializes an empty string.

3. The for loop:
   - `for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3):`
   - `len(ls)` is 5, so `len(ls) - 3 = 2`
   - So, `range(2, 0, -3)` produces a sequence starting at 2, ending before 0, stepping by -3.
   - Let's see what values this produces:
     - First value: 2
     - Next: 2 - 3 = -1, which is less than 0, so the loop stops.
   - So, the loop will run only once, with `i = 2`.

4. Inside the loop:
   - `ls[i:i+3]` is `ls[2:5]` (since i=2, i+3=5)
   - `ls` is "alacs", so:
     - ls[2] = 'a'
     - ls[3] = 'c'
     - ls[4] = 's'
     - So, ls[2:5] = "acs"
   - `'---'.join(ls[2:5])` joins the characters with '---':
     - 'a---c---s'
   - Then, `text2 += 'a---c---s' + '---'` => `text2 = 'a---c---s---'`

5. After the loop, `text2` is 'a---c---s---'

6. The function returns `text2[:-3]`, which removes the last 3 characters:
   - 'a---c---s---'[:-3] = 'a---c---s'

So, the output is 'a---c---s'.
