[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step.

The function `f(nums)` iterates over the indices of `nums` from `len(nums)-2` down to 0 (inclusive), i.e., in reverse order, skipping the last element.

Given input:
nums = [5, 3, 3, 7]

The range in the for loop is:
range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1)
len(nums) = 4, so len(nums) - 2 = 2
So, range(2, -1, -1) â†’ [2, 1, 0]

So, the loop will process i = 2, 1, 0 in that order.

Let's process each step:

1. i = 2
   nums[2] = 3
   3 % 2 == 1 (odd), so nothing happens.

2. i = 1
   nums[1] = 3
   3 % 2 == 1 (odd), so nothing happens.

3. i = 0
   nums[0] = 5
   5 % 2 == 1 (odd), so nothing happens.

At no point is an even number found, so no elements are removed.

Return nums.

So the output is [5, 3, 3, 7].
