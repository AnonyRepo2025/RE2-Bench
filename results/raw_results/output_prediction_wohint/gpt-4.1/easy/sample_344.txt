[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `list` and `operation`.
2. It creates a shallow copy of `list` called `new_list` using `list[:]`.
   - So, `new_list` is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
3. It sorts `new_list` in place: `new_list.sort()`.
   - After sorting, `new_list` becomes `[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`.
4. It calls `operation(new_list)`.
   - We don't know what the lambda does, but since it is not modifying `list` (the original), and only `new_list` is sorted and passed to the operation, unless the operation has a side effect on the original list (which is not possible here, since `new_list` is a copy), the original `list` remains unchanged.
5. The function returns `list` (the original list).

So, regardless of what the lambda does to `new_list`, the function returns the original list, which is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
