Let's step through the code:

1. The AreaCalculator is initialized with radius=2.
2. The method calculate_sector_area is called with angle=3.141592653589793 (which is π).
3. The formula used is: area = radius^2 * angle / 2
   - radius^2 = 2^2 = 4
   - area = 4 * π / 2 = (4/2) * π = 2 * π
   - π ≈ 3.141592653589793
   - 2 * π = 2 * 3.141592653589793 = 6.283185307179586

So the output will be 6.283185307179586.
