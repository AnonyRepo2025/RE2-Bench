[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function with the given inputs:
- number = 4
- need = 8
- remaining = 9

The function checks if `need <= remaining`:
- 8 <= 9 is True.

So, it executes the first branch:
- return [number + need, remaining - need]
- number + need = 4 + 8 = 12
- remaining - need = 9 - 8 = 1

So, the function will return [12, 1].
