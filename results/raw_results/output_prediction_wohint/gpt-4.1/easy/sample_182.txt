[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

1. The function `f(dic)` takes a dictionary as input.
2. It returns `sorted(dic.items(), key=lambda x: x[0])`.
   - `dic.items()` returns a view of the dictionary's items as (key, value) pairs. For the input, this will be `[('b', 1), ('a', 2)]` (order in a dict is not guaranteed before Python 3.7, but in this context, the order doesn't matter because we sort).
   - The `sorted()` function sorts these items by the key (the first element of each tuple), as specified by `key=lambda x: x[0]`.
   - Sorting `[('b', 1), ('a', 2)]` by key results in `[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]`.

So, the output will be a list of tuples: `[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]`.
