[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step with the given input.

Inputs:
- array = [2, 15, 15, 1]
- list = [15, 1]

Step 1: `array.extend(list)`
- This will append all elements of `list` to `array`.
- array becomes: [2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1]

Step 2: `[e for e in array if e % 2 == 0]`
- This is a list comprehension, but its result is not assigned or used, so it has no effect.

Step 3: `return [e for e in array if e >= 10]`
- We filter all elements in `array` that are greater than or equal to 10.
- array is [2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1]
- Elements >= 10: 15, 15, 15

So the output will be [15, 15, 15].
