Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The code reads a line of input and splits it into two variables, a and b.
   The input is: "294702567 726956429"
   So, a = "294702567", b = "726956429"

2. Next, b is reversed as a string: b[::-1]
   "726956429"[::-1] = "924659627"

3. Then, b is converted to an integer: int("924659627") = 924659627

4. a is converted to an integer: int("294702567") = 294702567

5. The code prints the sum: 294702567 + 924659627 = 1219362194

So, the output will be 1219362194.
