[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `_validate_phoneNumber` step by step with the input `"jgdjrj"`:

1. The function first checks `if not phoneNumber:`. The input is `"jgdjrj"`, which is a non-empty string, so this check is False and we continue.
2. Next, it checks `if len(phoneNumber) != 11 or not phoneNumber.isdigit():`
   - `len("jgdjrj")` is 6, which is not 11, so this condition is True.
   - Also, `"jgdjrj".isdigit()` is False, but since the first part is already True, the whole condition is True.
3. Since the condition is True, the function returns `None`.

Therefore, the output will be `None`.
