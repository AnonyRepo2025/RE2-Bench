[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the input `text = "mrq7y"`.

1. The function starts by initializing `result_list` as `['3', '3', '3', '3']`.
2. The next line checks `if result_list:`. Since `result_list` is a non-empty list, this condition is True.
3. Inside the if block, `result_list.clear()` is called, which empties the list. Now, `result_list` is `[]`.
4. The function then returns `len(text)`. The input `text` is `"mrq7y"`, which has 5 characters.
5. So, the function returns 5.

The output should be 5.
