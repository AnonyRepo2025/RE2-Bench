[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

1. The function `truncate_number` takes a float `number` and returns `number % 1.0`.
2. The modulo operation `%` with 1.0 returns the fractional part of the number. For example, `3.5 % 1.0` gives `0.5` because 3.5 divided by 1.0 is 3 with a remainder of 0.5.
3. The input is `number = 3.5`.
4. So, the function computes `3.5 % 1.0`, which is `0.5`.
5. The function returns `0.5`.
