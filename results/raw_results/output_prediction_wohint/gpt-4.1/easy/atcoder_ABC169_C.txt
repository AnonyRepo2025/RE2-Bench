[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The input is `"1 0.01"`. The input() function will read this as the string: `1 0.01`.
2. `a, b = input().split()` splits the string into two parts: `a = "1"`, `b = "0.01"`.
3. `b = b[0] + b[2:]`:
   - `b[0]` is `"0"`, `b[2:]` is `"01"` (since b[2] is the second '0' in "0.01", and b[3] is '1').
   - So, `b = "0" + "01" = "001"`.
4. `a = int(a)` converts `"1"` to `1`.
5. `b = int(b)` converts `"001"` to `1`.
6. `print(a * b // 100)`:
   - `a * b` is `1 * 1 = 1`.
   - `1 // 100` is integer division, which is `0`.

So the output will be `0`.
