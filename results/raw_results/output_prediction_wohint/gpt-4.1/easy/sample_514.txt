Let's step through the function `f` with the input `text = "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.

1. The function splits the text by whitespace: `text.split()`.
   - The input string is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"
   - Splitting by whitespace gives: ['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-']

2. The function then iterates over each `item` in this list.

First iteration: `item = '-stew---corn-and-beans-in'`
- The code does:
    text = text.replace('-{}'.format(item), ' ').replace('{}-'.format(item), ' ')
- '-{}'.format(item) = '--stew---corn-and-beans-in'
- '{}-'.format(item) = '-stew---corn-and-beans-in-'
- So, text.replace('--stew---corn-and-beans-in', ' ')
    - Let's check if '--stew---corn-and-beans-in' is in the text.
    - The text is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"
    - '--stew---corn-and-beans-in' is not present (the text starts with a single '-', not two).
- Next, text.replace('-stew---corn-and-beans-in-', ' ')
    - Is '-stew---corn-and-beans-in-' in the text?
    - The text is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"
    - '-stew---corn-and-beans-in-' is not present (there is no '-' at the end of that substring).
- So, after this iteration, text remains unchanged: "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"

Second iteration: `item = 'soup-.-'`
- '-{}'.format(item) = '-soup-.-'
- '{}-'.format(item) = 'soup-.--' (note the extra '-')
- text.replace('-soup-.-', ' ')
    - Is '-soup-.-' in the text?
    - The text is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"
    - There is 'soup-.-' at the end, but not '-soup-.-' (there is a space before 'soup-.-').
- text.replace('soup-.-', ' ')
    - Is 'soup-.-' in the text?
    - Yes, at the end.
    - So, text becomes "-stew---corn-and-beans-in  " (the 'soup-.-' is replaced with a space).
- Now, after this iteration, text is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in  " (note the two spaces at the end).

After the loop, the function returns `text.strip('-')`.
- text is "-stew---corn-and-beans-in  "
- text.strip('-') removes leading and trailing '-' characters.
- The leading '-' is removed, so text becomes "stew---corn-and-beans-in  "
- There are no trailing '-' characters, so the trailing spaces remain.

So, the final output is "stew---corn-and-beans-in  " (with two spaces at the end).
