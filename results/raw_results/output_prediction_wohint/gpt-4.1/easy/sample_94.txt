[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

1. The function `f(a, b)` takes two arguments, both expected to be dictionaries.
2. It returns `{**a, **b}`. This is Python's dictionary unpacking syntax, which creates a new dictionary by unpacking all key-value pairs from `a` and then from `b`. If there are duplicate keys, the value from the later dictionary (`b`) will overwrite the value from the earlier one (`a`).

Given the input:
- `a = {"w": 5, "wi": 10}`
- `b = {"w": 3}`

Let's perform the unpacking:
- Start with all key-value pairs from `a`: `{"w": 5, "wi": 10}`
- Then add all key-value pairs from `b`: `{"w": 3}`

When adding `b`, the key `"w"` already exists, so its value will be overwritten by the value from `b`, which is `3`.

So the resulting dictionary will be:
- `"w": 3` (from `b`)
- `"wi": 10` (from `a`, not overwritten)

So the output will be: `{"w": 3, "wi": 10}`
