[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the code step by step:

1. The input provides self._data as an empty dictionary: {}.
2. The method called is __delitem__ with key="first_name".
3. __delitem__ calls self._convert_key("first_name").
4. _convert_key checks if key is a str (it is), so it calls self._to_camel_case("first_name").
5. However, the class definition provided does NOT include a _to_camel_case method. This means that when _convert_key tries to call self._to_camel_case, it will raise an AttributeError: 'CamelCaseMap' object has no attribute '_to_camel_case'.
6. Therefore, the code will not proceed to del self._data[...], and will instead raise an exception.
