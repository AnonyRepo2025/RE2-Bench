[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the code step by step.

1. The Thermostat object is initialized with current_temperature=25, target_temperature=25, mode="heat".
2. The set_target_temperature method is called with temperature=10.
3. Inside set_target_temperature, self.target_temperature is set to 10.
4. The method does not return anything (no return statement), so the output is None.
