[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and input step by step.

1. The MusicPlayer instance has:
   - playlist: []
   - current_song: "song1"
   - volume: 50

2. The stop() method is called.
   - It checks if self.current_song is truthy. Here, self.current_song is "song1", which is a non-empty string, so it's truthy.
   - It sets self.current_song = None.
   - It returns True.

Therefore, the output will be True.
