[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the execution of `_parallel_fit_estimator` with the given input.

1. **Inputs**:
   - `estimator`: a dict representing a LogisticRegression-like estimator with parameters (penalty='l2', dual=False, tol=0.0001, C=1.0, fit_intercept=True, etc.)
   - `X`: a 2D array (150, 2) of floats (features)
   - `y`: a 1D array (150,) of ints (labels: 0, 1, 2)
   - `sample_weight`: None

2. **Step 1**: The function checks if `sample_weight` is not None. It is None, so it calls `estimator.fit(X, y)`.

3. **Step 2**: The estimator is a LogisticRegression-like object. Let's simulate the fit process.

   - The estimator's `solver` is "warn", so `_check_solver` will set it to "liblinear" and issue a warning.
   - The estimator's `multi_class` is "warn", so `_check_multi_class` will set it to "ovr" and issue a warning (since n_classes > 2).
   - The penalty is "l2", which is supported by "liblinear".
   - The data is checked for shape and type. X is (150, 2), y is (150,).
   - The classes are determined: np.unique(y) = [0, 1, 2], so n_classes = 3.
   - Since solver is "liblinear", and n_jobs is None, no warning about n_jobs.
   - The fit will call `_fit_liblinear` with the data and parameters.

4. **Step 3**: The fit process will succeed, and the estimator will be fitted. The function returns the fitted estimator.

5. **Step 4**: The output of `_parallel_fit_estimator` is the fitted estimator object.

6. **Step 5**: Since the input estimator is a dict (not a real sklearn object), but the function expects an object with a `.fit()` method, in a real scenario, this would fail. But for the purposes of this simulation, we assume the estimator is a proper LogisticRegression object.

7. **Step 6**: The output is the fitted estimator, which is the same object as input, but now with fitted attributes (e.g., `coef_`, `intercept_`, `classes_`).

8. **Step 7**: Since the output is the estimator object, and the input is a dict, the output should be the same dict, but with added keys: `coef_`, `intercept_`, `classes_`, etc.

But since the function returns the estimator object, and the input is a dict, the output is the same dict (with possibly more keys).

**Summary**: The function returns the fitted estimator, which is the same as the input estimator, but now fitted. In this context, since the input is a dict, the output is the same dict (possibly with more keys, but unless we simulate the full fit, we just return the estimator).
