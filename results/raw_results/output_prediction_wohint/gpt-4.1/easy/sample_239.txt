Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

The function f takes two arguments: text and froms.

1. text = text.lstrip(froms)
   - lstrip(froms) removes all characters in the string 'froms' from the left (start) of 'text', until it finds a character not in 'froms'.
   - text = "0 t 1cos "
   - froms = "st 0\t\n  " (note: includes space, tab, newline, 's', 't', '0')
   - Let's process lstrip:
     - The first character is '0', which is in froms, so remove it.
     - Next is ' ', which is in froms, so remove it.
     - Next is 't', which is in froms, so remove it.
     - Next is ' ', which is in froms, so remove it.
     - Next is '1', which is NOT in froms, so stop.
   - So after lstrip, text is "1cos "

2. text = text.rstrip(froms)
   - rstrip(froms) removes all characters in 'froms' from the right (end) of 'text', until it finds a character not in 'froms'.
   - text = "1cos "
   - Let's process rstrip:
     - The last character is ' ', which is in froms, so remove it.
     - Now text is "1cos"
     - The last character is 's', which is in froms, so remove it.
     - Now text is "1co"
     - The last character is 'o', which is NOT in froms, so stop.
   - So after rstrip, text is "1co"

3. Return value is "1co"
