[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step with the given input.

Inputs:
- string = ""
- substring = "A"

The function does the following:
1. While `string.startswith(substring)` is True, it removes the first `len(substring)` characters from `string`.
2. When the condition is False, it returns `string`.

Let's check the condition:
- `string` is "", which is an empty string.
- `substring` is "A".

Does `string.startswith(substring)`? 
- "".startswith("A") is False, because the empty string does not start with "A".

Therefore, the while loop is never entered, and the function immediately returns the original `string`, which is "".

So, the output will be an empty string.
