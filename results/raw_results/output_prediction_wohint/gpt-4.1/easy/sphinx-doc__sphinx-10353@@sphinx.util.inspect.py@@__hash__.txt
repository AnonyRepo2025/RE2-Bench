[THOUGHT]
The `__hash__` method of the `TypeAliasForwardRef` class simply returns the hash of the `name` attribute of the instance. In this case, `self.name` is "example". Therefore, the output will be the result of `hash("example")`. The exact value of `hash("example")` can vary between Python runs (due to hash randomization), but for a single run, it will be a specific integer. For demonstration, let's assume a typical hash value for "example" in a single run.
