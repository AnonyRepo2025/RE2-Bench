[THOUGHT]
The set_city method simply sets self.city to the provided city argument. It does not return anything (i.e., returns None). Given the input, self.city is initially "New York", and the argument city is "Beijing". After calling set_city, self.city will be "Beijing". However, since the function does not return anything, the output will be None.
