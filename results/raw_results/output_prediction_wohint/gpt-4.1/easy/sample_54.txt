[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function with the given inputs:

Inputs:
- text = "happy"
- s = 0
- e = 3

Step 1: sublist = text[s:e] = text[0:3] = "hap"
Step 2: if not sublist: (sublist is "hap", which is not empty, so continue)
Step 3: min(sublist) finds the minimum character in "hap" (lexicographically).
- Characters: 'h', 'a', 'p'
- Lexicographically, 'a' < 'h' < 'p', so min(sublist) = 'a'
Step 4: sublist.index(min(sublist)) = "hap".index('a') = 1

So, the function will return 1.
