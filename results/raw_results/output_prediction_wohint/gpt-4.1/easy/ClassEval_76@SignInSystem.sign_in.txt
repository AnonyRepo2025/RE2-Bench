[THOUGHT]
Let's walk through the code step by step:

1. The SignInSystem instance has self.users = {"user1": True}.
2. The method sign_in is called with username="user1".
3. The method checks if "user1" is not in self.users. "user1" is in self.users, so this is False.
4. The else branch is executed: self.users["user1"] = True (which it already is), and then returns True.

So, the output will be True.
