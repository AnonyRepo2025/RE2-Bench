[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function with the given inputs:

Inputs:
- s = "@@@ff"
- ch = "@"

1. The function assigns `sl = s`, so initially, sl = "@@@ff".
2. It checks if ch ("@") is in s ("@@@ff"). Yes, "@" is present.
3. It then does `sl = s.lstrip(ch)`. The `lstrip` method removes all leading occurrences of the character "@" from the string.
   - "@@@ff".lstrip("@") removes all leading "@"s, so sl becomes "ff".
4. Next, it checks if len(sl) == 0. "ff" has length 2, so this is False.
5. It skips the if block that would add '!?', and proceeds to return sl.
6. So, the function returns "ff".
