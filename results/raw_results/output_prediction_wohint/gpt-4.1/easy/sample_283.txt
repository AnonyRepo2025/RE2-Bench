[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function with the provided input.

Inputs:
- dictionary = {
    "Captain America": 3,
    "Black Panther": 0,
    "Thor": 1,
    "Ant-Man": 6
  }
- key = "Iron Man"

Step 1: del dictionary[key]
- The function tries to delete the entry with key "Iron Man" from the dictionary.
- However, "Iron Man" is NOT a key in the dictionary.
- In Python, attempting to delete a key that does not exist in a dictionary with `del` will raise a KeyError.

Therefore, the function will raise a KeyError and will not proceed further.

The output will be an exception, specifically a KeyError with the missing key "Iron Man".
