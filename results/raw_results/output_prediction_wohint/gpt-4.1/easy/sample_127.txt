[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

1. The function `f` takes a single argument `text`.
2. It calls `text.splitlines()`, which splits the string at line boundaries and returns a list of lines.
3. It then returns the length of this list.

Let's look at the input:
- The input string is `"145\n\n12fjkjg"`

Let's see what `splitlines()` does with this string:
- The string is: 1 4 5 \n \n 1 2 f j k j g
- The first `\n` splits after "145", so that's one line: "145"
- The second `\n` is an empty line, so that's another line: ""
- After the second `\n`, we have "12fjkjg", which is the third line.

So, `splitlines()` will return: ["145", "", "12fjkjg"]

The length of this list is 3.

Therefore, the output will be 3.
