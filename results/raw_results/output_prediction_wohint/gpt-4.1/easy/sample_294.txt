Let's step through the function `f` with the given inputs:

Inputs:
- n = "x"
- m = "$"
- text = "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"

Step 1: Check if `text.strip() == ''`
- text is "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris", which is not empty or whitespace, so we proceed.

Step 2: head, mid, tail = (text[0], text[1:-1], text[-1])
- text[0] = "2"
- text[1:-1] = "xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri" (from index 1 up to but not including the last character)
- text[-1] = "s"

Step 3: joined = head.replace(n, m) + mid.replace(n, m) + tail.replace(n, m)
- head.replace("x", "$"): "2" does not contain "x", so remains "2"
- mid.replace("x", "$"): "xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri"
    - "x" is at the start, so it becomes "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri"
- tail.replace("x", "$"): "s" does not contain "x", so remains "s"

So, joined = "2" + "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri" + "s" = "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"

Step 4: return joined

Final output: "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"
