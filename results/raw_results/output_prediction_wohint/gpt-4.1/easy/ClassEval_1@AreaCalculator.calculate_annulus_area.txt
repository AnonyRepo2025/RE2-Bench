[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:

1. An AreaCalculator object is created with radius=2000, but this value is not used in the calculation.
2. The method calculate_annulus_area is called with inner_radius=0 and outer_radius=1.
3. The formula used is: area = π * (outer_radius^2 - inner_radius^2)
   - outer_radius^2 = 1^2 = 1
   - inner_radius^2 = 0^2 = 0
   - Difference = 1 - 0 = 1
   - area = π * 1 = 3.141592653589793 (using math.pi)
4. The function returns 3.141592653589793.
