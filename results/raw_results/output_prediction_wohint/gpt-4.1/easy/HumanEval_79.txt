[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `decimal` as input.
2. It returns a string: 'db' + bin(decimal)[2:] + 'db'
   - `bin(decimal)` converts the integer to its binary representation as a string, prefixed with '0b'.
   - `[2:]` slices off the first two characters ('0b'), leaving just the binary digits.
   - The result is then concatenated with 'db' at the start and end.

Given the input:
- decimal = 103

Let's compute:
- bin(103) = '0b1100111'
- bin(103)[2:] = '1100111'
- 'db' + '1100111' + 'db' = 'db1100111db'

So the output will be:
{
    "output": "db1100111db"
}
