[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:

- self.booked_rooms = {"single": {}} (so for "single" room type, there are no bookings yet)
- check_in("single", 2, "guest 1")

Step 1: 
if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():
    return False
"single" is in self.booked_rooms, so continue.

Step 2:
if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:
    ...
"guest 1" is NOT in self.booked_rooms["single"] (which is an empty dict), so this block is skipped.

There is no further code after this, so the function will implicitly return None.

So the output is None.
