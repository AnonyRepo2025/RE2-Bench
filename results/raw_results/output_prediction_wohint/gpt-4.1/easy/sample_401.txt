[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the given inputs:

Inputs:
- text = "mathematics"
- suffix = "example"

1. The function first checks if `suffix` is truthy (not empty or None) and if `text.endswith(suffix)` is True.
   - `suffix` is "example", which is not empty, so this is True.
   - `text.endswith(suffix)` checks if "mathematics" ends with "example". "mathematics" does not end with "example", so this is False.

2. Since the condition in the if statement is not met, the function returns `text` as is.

So, the output will be "mathematics".
