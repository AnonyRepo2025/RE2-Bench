[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the input and the function:

- The HRManagementSystem instance has self.employees = {"1": {...}}. The key is the string "1".
- The add_employee method is called with employee_id=1 (an integer), name="John Doe", position="Manager", department="HR", salary=5000.

Inside add_employee:
- It checks if employee_id in self.employees.
- employee_id is 1 (int), but the existing key in self.employees is "1" (str).
- In Python, 1 (int) and "1" (str) are not equal, so 1 in {"1": ...} is False.
- Therefore, the else branch is taken: self.employees[1] = {...} is set, and True is returned.

So, the function will return True.
