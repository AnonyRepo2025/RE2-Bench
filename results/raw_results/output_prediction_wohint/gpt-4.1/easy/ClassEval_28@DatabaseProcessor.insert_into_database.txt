[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The `DatabaseProcessor` is initialized with `database_name="test.db"`.
2. The method `insert_into_database` is called with:
   - `table_name="test_table"`
   - `data` is a list of two dictionaries: [{"name": "John", "age": 25}, {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}]
3. The method connects to the SQLite database "test.db".
4. It creates a cursor.
5. For each item in `data`, it executes:
   - `INSERT INTO test_table (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)` with the values from the dictionary.
   - First: ("John", 25)
   - Second: ("Alice", 30)
6. After the loop, it commits the transaction and closes the connection.
7. The function does not return anything (no return statement).

Therefore, the output will be `null` (i.e., `None` in Python).
