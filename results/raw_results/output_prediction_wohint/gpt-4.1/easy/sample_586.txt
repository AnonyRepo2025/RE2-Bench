[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `char`.
2. It returns `text.rindex(char)`. The `rindex` method in Python returns the highest index in the string where substring `char` is found. If the substring is not found, it raises a ValueError.
3. The input is:
   - `text`: "breakfast"
   - `char`: "e"
4. Let's look for the last occurrence of "e" in "breakfast":
   - The string is: b r e a k f a s t
   - Indexes: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
   - "e" occurs at index 2.
   - There is only one "e" in "breakfast", at index 2.
5. Therefore, `text.rindex(char)` will return 2.
