[THOUGHT]
The class TimeUtils has an attribute self.datetime, which is a datetime.datetime object. The get_current_date method formats this datetime using the format '%Y-%m-%d', which means it will return the year, month, and day in the form "YYYY-MM-DD".

The input provides self.datetime as "2025-08-25 16:37:34.963631". When get_current_date is called, it will format this datetime as "2025-08-25".
