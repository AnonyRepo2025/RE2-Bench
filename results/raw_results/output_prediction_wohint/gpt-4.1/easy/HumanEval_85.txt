[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the input step by step.

The function `add(lst)` does the following:
- It uses a list comprehension: `[lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0]`
    - `range(1, len(lst), 2)` means: start at index 1, go up to (but not including) len(lst), step by 2.
    - For each such index `i`, if `lst[i] % 2 == 0` (i.e., the element at index `i` is even), include `lst[i]` in the list.
- Then, it sums up the resulting list.

Given input:
lst = [4, 4, 6, 8]

Let's enumerate the indices:
- Index 0: 4
- Index 1: 4
- Index 2: 6
- Index 3: 8

`range(1, len(lst), 2)` gives us indices: 1, 3

Now, let's check each:
- i=1: lst[1] = 4, which is even (4 % 2 == 0), so include 4.
- i=3: lst[3] = 8, which is even (8 % 2 == 0), so include 8.

So the list comprehension produces: [4, 8]

Sum: 4 + 8 = 12

Therefore, the output is 12.
