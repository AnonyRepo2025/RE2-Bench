[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the `__mul__` method of `QuarterOffset`:

1. The method signature is `def __mul__(self, other):`.
2. The first line checks: `if isinstance(other, float): return NotImplemented`
   - In the input, `other` is 2.5, which is a float.
   - So, `isinstance(2.5, float)` is True.
   - Therefore, the method returns `NotImplemented` immediately, and does not proceed to the next line.
3. The rest of the method is not executed.

So, the output will be `NotImplemented`.
