[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the provided inputs.

1. The function takes two arguments: `items` (a list of strings) and `target` (a string).
2. The function checks if `target` is in `items`. If so, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `items`. Otherwise, it returns -1.

Given:
- items = ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]
- target = "**"

Step-by-step:
- Is "**" in items? Let's check:
  - items[0] = "1" (not equal)
  - items[1] = "+" (not equal)
  - items[2] = "-" (not equal)
  - items[3] = "**" (equal! Found at index 3)
- Since "**" is found in the list at index 3, the function will return 3.

No need to check further; the function will return 3.
