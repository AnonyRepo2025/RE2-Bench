[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function with the input "Hi there".

1. The function takes a string `st`. Here, `st = "Hi there"`.

2. The function uses `st.lower()` throughout, so let's compute that:
   - `st.lower()` = "hi there"

3. The function first computes `st.lower().rindex('i')`:
   - "hi there".rindex('i') = 1 (the 'i' in "Hi")

4. Next, it computes `st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i'))`:
   - This is equivalent to "hi there".rindex('h', 1)
   - The `rindex` function with two arguments searches for 'h' in the substring starting at index 1.
   - "hi there"[1:] = "i there"
   - In "i there", the first 'h' is at index 2 (relative to the substring), which is index 3 in the original string.
   - But `rindex` returns the last occurrence in the range, so let's check all occurrences of 'h' in "hi there" starting from index 1:
     - Index 1: 'i'
     - Index 2: ' '
     - Index 3: 't'
     - Index 4: 'h'
     - Index 5: 'e'
     - Index 6: 'r'
     - Index 7: 'e'
   - The only 'h' after index 1 is at index 4.
   - So, "hi there".rindex('h', 1) = 4

5. Now, the function checks if this value (4) is greater than or equal to the index of 'i' (1):
   - 4 >= 1 â†’ True

6. Since the condition is True, the function returns 'Hey'.
