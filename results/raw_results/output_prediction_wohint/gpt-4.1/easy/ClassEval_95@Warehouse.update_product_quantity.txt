[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the code:

1. The method `update_product_quantity` is called with `product_id=1` and `quantity=-1`.
2. The current `self.inventory` is:
   {
       "1": {
           "name": "product 3",
           "quantity": 9
       }
   }
   Note: The key in the inventory is the string "1", but the input `product_id` is the integer 1.
3. The method checks: `if product_id in self.inventory:`. Since `product_id` is 1 (int), and the key in the dictionary is "1" (str), this check will fail because Python distinguishes between int and str keys.
4. Therefore, the body of the if-statement is not executed, and nothing happens.
5. The method does not return anything (implicit return None).

So, the output is None, and the inventory remains unchanged.
