[THOUGHT]
The method generate_email_pattern is a simple instance method that returns a string containing a regular expression pattern for matching email addresses. The pattern is:

'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'

In Python, double backslashes are used to escape the backslash in the string, so the actual string returned will contain the backslashes as written. There are no arguments or computations; it just returns this string.
