[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and input step by step.

1. The class DataStatistics2 is initialized with data, which is converted to a numpy array.
2. The get_variance method calls np.var(self.data) and rounds the result to 2 decimal places.
3. The input provides self.data as "[1 2 3 4]". This is a string representation of a numpy array, but in actual code, self.data would be a numpy array with values [1, 2, 3, 4].
4. The variance of [1, 2, 3, 4] is calculated as follows:
   - Mean = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5
   - Variance = ((1-2.5)^2 + (2-2.5)^2 + (3-2.5)^2 + (4-2.5)^2) / 4
   - (1-2.5)^2 = 2.25
   - (2-2.5)^2 = 0.25
   - (3-2.5)^2 = 0.25
   - (4-2.5)^2 = 2.25
   - Sum = 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5
   - Variance = 5 / 4 = 1.25
   - Rounded to 2 decimal places: 1.25
Therefore, get_variance() will return 1.25.
