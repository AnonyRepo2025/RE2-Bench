[THOUGHT]
The function `read_file_as_json` opens the file at `self.file_path` (which is "test_2.txt") and loads its contents as JSON using `json.load(file)`. The output will be the parsed JSON data from the file.

However, the actual output depends entirely on the contents of "test_2.txt". Since the contents of the file are not provided in the input, I cannot know what data will be returned. If the file contains, for example, `{"a": 1}`, the output would be `{"a": 1}`. If the file contains a list, the output would be that list, etc.

Since the file contents are not specified, the only possible answer is that the output will be the JSON data contained in "test_2.txt". But since the problem expects a concrete output, and no file contents are given, the best I can do is to state that the output is the parsed JSON from the file.
