[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the code step by step.

1. The input data is [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7].
2. The mean is calculated as sum(data) / len(data).
3. sum(data) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 25
4. len(data) = 6
5. mean = 25 / 6 â‰ˆ 4.166666...
6. The result is rounded to 2 decimal places: round(4.166666..., 2) = 4.17

So the output will be 4.17.
