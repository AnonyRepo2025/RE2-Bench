[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step with the given input.

1. The input is an empty list: nums = []
2. The for loop is: for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -3):
   - len(nums) = 0, so range(-1, -1, -3)
   - In Python, range(start, stop, step) includes start but excludes stop, and step is -3.
   - range(-1, -1, -3) produces an empty sequence, because the start and stop are the same.
3. Therefore, the for loop body will not execute at all.
4. After the loop, the function returns nums, which is still [].

So, the output will be an empty list.
