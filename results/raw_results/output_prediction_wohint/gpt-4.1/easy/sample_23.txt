[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function with the given inputs:

Inputs:
- text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"
- chars = "0123456789-"

Step 1: Check if chars is truthy. It is ("0123456789-"), so we execute:
    text = text.rstrip(chars)

What does rstrip(chars) do? It removes all trailing characters that are in the set "0123456789-" from the end of the string.

Let's look at the end of the string:
"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"
The end is "2.2"

Let's see if any of these characters are in "0123456789-":
- The last character is "2" (in chars) → remove it.
- Now the end is ".2"
- The last character is "2" (in chars) → remove it.
- Now the end is "."
- The last character is "." (not in chars) → stop.

So after rstrip, text becomes:
"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."

Step 2: Check if text == '' (empty string). It is not, so we skip the return '-'.

Step 3: Return text.

So the output is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."
