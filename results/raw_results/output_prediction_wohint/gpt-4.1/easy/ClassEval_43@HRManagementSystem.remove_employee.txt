[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and input step by step.

1. The HRManagementSystem instance has an `employees` dictionary with a single key: "1" (a string), representing an employee with id "1".
2. The method `remove_employee` is called with `employee_id=2` (an integer).
3. The method checks if `employee_id` is in `self.employees`. The keys in `self.employees` are strings, but `employee_id` is an integer (2).
4. Since 2 (int) is not equal to "1" (str), and there is no key 2 (int) in the dictionary, the condition `if employee_id in self.employees` is False.
5. Therefore, the method returns False.
