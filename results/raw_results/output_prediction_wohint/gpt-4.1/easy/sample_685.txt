[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function:

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `array` and `elem`.
2. It returns `array.count(elem) + elem`.
3. `array.count(elem)` counts how many times `elem` appears in `array`.
4. The input array is `[1, 1, 1]` and `elem` is `-2`.
5. `array.count(-2)` will count how many times `-2` appears in `[1, 1, 1]`. Since `-2` is not in the array, the count is `0`.
6. The function returns `0 + (-2)`, which is `-2`.
