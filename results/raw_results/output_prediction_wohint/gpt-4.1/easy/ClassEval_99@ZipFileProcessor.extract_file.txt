[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and the input step by step.

1. The class ZipFileProcessor is initialized with self.file_name = "example.zip".
2. The method extract_file is called with file_name="example5.txt" and output_path="output_directory".
3. The method tries to open "example.zip" as a zip file and extract "example5.txt" to "output_directory".
4. If any exception occurs (e.g., file not found, file not in archive, permission error), it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

However, we are not told whether "example.zip" exists, or whether "example5.txt" is inside it, or whether "output_directory" is writable. Since we are only to predict the output based on the code and the input, and not on the actual file system, the function will return True if everything works, and False if any error occurs.

But in this context, since we don't know if "example5.txt" exists in "example.zip", and since the function is robust to errors (returns False on any exception), the most conservative and likely answer is False, because unless the file is present, extraction will fail.

But if the test is only about code logic, and not about actual files, the function would return True if the file exists and is extractable, otherwise False.

Given no further information, the safest answer is False.
