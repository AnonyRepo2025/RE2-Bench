[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The method `write_excel` is called with a list of lists as `data` and a file name "test_data_process.xlsx".
2. Inside the try block:
   - `openpyxl.Workbook()` creates a new Excel workbook.
   - `sheet = workbook.active` gets the active worksheet.
   - For each row in `data`, `sheet.append(row)` appends the row to the worksheet.
   - `workbook.save(file_name)` saves the workbook to the specified file.
   - `workbook.close()` closes the workbook.
   - If all goes well, it returns 1.
3. If any exception occurs, it returns 0.

The data is a valid list of lists, and the file name is a valid string. There is no reason for an exception to occur in normal circumstances. The function should return 1.
