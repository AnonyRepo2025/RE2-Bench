[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step.

The function takes a list `nums` and iterates over it by index. For each element, if it is divisible by 3, it appends that element to the end of the list. The loop runs for the original length of the list, but since we are appending to the list during iteration, the length increases, and the loop will continue until it reaches the new length.

Let's see what happens with the input: nums = [1, 3, 3]

Initial nums: [1, 3, 3]
len(nums) = 3 initially, but as we append, len(nums) increases.

Let's track i and nums step by step:

- i = 0: nums[0] = 1. 1 % 3 != 0, so nothing happens.
- i = 1: nums[1] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 2: nums[2] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 3: nums[3] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 4: nums[4] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 5: nums[5] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 6: nums[6] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 7: nums[7] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 8: nums[8] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 9: nums[9] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 10: nums[10] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 11: nums[11] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 12: nums[12] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 13: nums[13] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 14: nums[14] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 15: nums[15] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 16: nums[16] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 17: nums[17] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 18: nums[18] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 19: nums[19] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 20: nums[20] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 21: nums[21] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 22: nums[22] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 23: nums[23] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 24: nums[24] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 25: nums[25] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 26: nums[26] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 27: nums[27] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 28: nums[28] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
- i = 29: nums[29] = 3. 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. nums becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

At this point, i = 30, but now len(nums) = 31, so the loop continues.

This process will never end, because every time we append a 3, the length increases, and the next index is also a 3, so the loop will keep appending 3s forever.

Therefore, the function will never terminate; it will enter an infinite loop.

But if we were to limit the number of steps, say, if Python had a maximum recursion or iteration limit, or if we just want to show the first few steps, the list would keep growing with more and more 3s.

But as per the function, it will not terminate for this input.

So, the output is: the function does not terminate (infinite loop).
