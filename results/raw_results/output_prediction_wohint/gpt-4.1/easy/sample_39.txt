[THOUGHT]
Let's step through the function `f` with the given input.

Inputs:
- array = [6, 2, 7, 1]
- elem = 6

Step 1: The function checks if `elem` (which is 6) is in `array` ([6, 2, 7, 1]).
- 6 is indeed present in the array (at index 0).

Step 2: Since the condition is true, the function returns `array.index(elem)`.
- `array.index(6)` returns the index of the first occurrence of 6 in the array, which is 0.

Therefore, the function will return 0.
