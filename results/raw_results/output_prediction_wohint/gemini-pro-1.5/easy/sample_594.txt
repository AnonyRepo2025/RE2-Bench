The `f` function takes a string named `file` as input and returns the index of the first newline character (`\n`) within the string.

The input string is "n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n.\n".
The newline character appears at the end of the string.

Let's count the characters before the newline:
"n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n." has 35 characters.

Therefore, the index of the newline character is 35.
