The `remove_employee` method checks if the given `employee_id` exists as a key in the `self.employees` dictionary. In this case, `employee_id` is 2, and `self.employees` contains only the key "1". Since 2 is not in `self.employees`, the code inside the `if` block is skipped, and the `else` block is executed, returning `False`.
