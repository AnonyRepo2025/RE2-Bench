Let's trace the execution of `__delitem__`:

1. The `__delitem__` method is called with `key="first_name"`.
2. Inside `__delitem__`, `self._convert_key("first_name")` is called.
3. Inside `_convert_key`, since the key is a string, `self._to_camel_case("first_name")` is called. However, the implementation of `_to_camel_case` is not provided.  We can assume it converts the snake_case string "first_name" to camelCase. A typical conversion would produce "firstName".
4. `del self._data[converted_key]` is called.  Since `self._data` is an empty dictionary, and we are trying to delete a key that doesn't exist, a `KeyError` will be raised.
