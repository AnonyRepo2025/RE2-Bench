Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Initial state:**
   - `dictionary` is `{"Captain America": 3, "Black Panther": 0, "Thor": 1, "Ant-Man": 6}`
   - `key` is `"Iron Man"`

2. **`del dictionary[key]`:** This attempts to delete the entry with key `"Iron Man"`. Since `"Iron Man"` is not a key in the dictionary, this operation raises a `KeyError`.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "error": "KeyError: 'Iron Man'"
}
```
