The `_validate_phoneNumber` method checks if the provided phone number is valid.

1. It checks if the `phoneNumber` is empty. If it is, it returns `None`. In this case, the `phoneNumber` is "jgdjrj", so it's not empty.
2. It checks if the length of the `phoneNumber` is 11 and if it consists only of digits. The length of "jgdjrj" is 6, which is not equal to 11, and it contains non-digit characters. Therefore, the method returns `None`.
