Here's how the function `f` executes with the given inputs:

1. **Initial values:**
   - `s = "@@@ff"`
   - `ch = "@"`
   - `sl = s` (so `sl` is also "@@@ff")

2. **`if ch in s:`:** This condition is true because "@" is present in "@@@ff".

3. **`sl = s.lstrip(ch)`:** This removes leading occurrences of `ch` (which is "@") from `s`.  `sl` becomes "ff".

4. **`if len(sl) == 0:`:** This condition is false because the length of `sl` is 2.

5. **`return sl`:** The function returns the current value of `sl`, which is "ff".
