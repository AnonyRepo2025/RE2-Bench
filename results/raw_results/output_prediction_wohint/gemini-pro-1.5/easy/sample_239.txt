Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given inputs.

1. **Initial values:**
   - `text = "0 t 1cos "`
   - `froms = "st 0\t\n  "`

2. **`text.lstrip(froms)`:**
   The `lstrip()` method removes leading characters from `text` that are present in `froms`.
   - `froms` contains " ", "0", "s", "t", "\t", "\n".
   - The leading characters "0", " ", "t" are present in `froms`. These will be removed.
   - The resulting `text` becomes "1cos ".

3. **`text.rstrip(froms)`:**
   The `rstrip()` method removes trailing characters from `text` that are present in `froms`.
   - The trailing character " " is present in `froms`. This will be removed.
   - The resulting `text` becomes "1cos".

4. **Return:**
   The function returns the final value of `text`, which is "1cos".
