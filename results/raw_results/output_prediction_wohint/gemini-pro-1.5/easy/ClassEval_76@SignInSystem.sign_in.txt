Here's how the `sign_in` function will execute:

1. **Check if username exists:** The function checks if the given `username` ("user1") is present in the `self.users` dictionary. In this case, "user1" *is* present in the dictionary.

2. **Update user status and return:** Since the username exists, the code inside the `else` block is executed. This sets the value associated with "user1" in the `self.users` dictionary to `True`.  Then, the function returns `True`.
