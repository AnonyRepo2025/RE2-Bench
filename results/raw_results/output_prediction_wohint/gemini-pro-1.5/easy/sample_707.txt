Here's how we determine the output of the function `f` given the inputs:

1. **`text = "undbs l"`** and **`position = 1`**.
2. **`length = len(text)`**: `length` becomes 7.
3. **`index = position % (length + 1)`**: `index` becomes `1 % (7 + 1)` which is `1 % 8`, resulting in `index = 1`.
4. The `if` condition checks if `position < 0` or `index < 0`. Since neither of these is true (position is 1 and index is 1), the code inside the `if` block is skipped.
5. **`new_text = list(text)`**: `new_text` becomes `['u', 'n', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l']`.
6. **`new_text.pop(index)`**: Since `index` is 1, the element at index 1 (which is 'n') is removed. `new_text` becomes `['u', 'd', 'b', 's', ' ', 'l']`.
7. **`return ''.join(new_text)`**: The list `new_text` is joined back into a string. The returned value is "udbs l".
