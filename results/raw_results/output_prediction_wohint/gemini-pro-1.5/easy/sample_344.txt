Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `new_list` is created as a *copy* of the input `list`. This is crucial because modifications to `new_list` will not affect the original `list`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - `new_list.sort()` sorts `new_list` in place (modifies the list itself).  So, `new_list` becomes `[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`.

3. **Operation:**
   - The lambda function `<function <lambda> at 0x7fdf05186280>` is applied to the *sorted* `new_list`.  We don't know what the lambda function does, but it's important to note that it operates on the sorted copy.

4. **Return:**
   - The function returns the *original* `list`, which was never modified.

Therefore, the output will be the original, unsorted list.
