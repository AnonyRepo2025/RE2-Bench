Here's how we determine the output:

1. **string.title():** This method capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string and converts the rest to lowercase.  So, "1oE-err bzz-bmm" becomes "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm".

2. **.replace(' ', ''):** This method removes all spaces from the string. So, "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm" becomes "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm".

Therefore, the final output is "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm".
