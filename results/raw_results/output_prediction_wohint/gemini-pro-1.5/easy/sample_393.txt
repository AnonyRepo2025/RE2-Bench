Here's how we can determine the output of the function `f` with the given input:

1. **Input:** The input text is "scala".

2. **Reverse:** `ls = text[::-1]` reverses the string. `ls` becomes "alacs".

3. **Loop:** The loop iterates from `len(ls) - 3` down to 0, with a step of -3. Let's trace the loop:
   - `len(ls)` is 5.
   - The loop starts at `i = 2`.
   - The loop condition is `i > 0`.

   - **First iteration (i = 2):**
     - `ls[i:i+3]` is `ls[2:5]`, which is "acs".
     - `"---".join("acs")` becomes "a---c---s".
     - `text2` becomes "a---c---s---".

   - The loop continues as long as `i > 0`. Since the next value of `i` would be `2 - 3 = -1`, the loop terminates.

4. **Return:** The function returns `text2[:-3]`, which removes the last three characters ("---") from `text2`.

Therefore, the final output is "a---c---s".
