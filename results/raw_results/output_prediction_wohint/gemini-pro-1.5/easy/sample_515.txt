1. The `array` is copied to `result`. `result` is now `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. `result` is reversed in-place. `result` is now `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
3. A list comprehension multiplies each element of `result` by 2 and assigns it back to the entire slice of `result`. `result` becomes `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.
4. The function returns the modified `result`.
