The function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `decimal` as input and returns a string representing the binary equivalent of the decimal number, prefixed and suffixed with "db".

Here's how the execution unfolds with the given input (decimal = 103):

1. `bin(decimal)`: This converts the decimal number 103 to its binary representation. The result is the string '0b1100111'.
2. `bin(decimal)[2:]`: This slices the string from the 3rd character onwards, effectively removing the "0b" prefix. The result is '1100111'.
3. `'db' + ... + 'db'`: The string '1100111' is then prepended and appended with "db".

Therefore, the final output string will be 'db1100111db'.
