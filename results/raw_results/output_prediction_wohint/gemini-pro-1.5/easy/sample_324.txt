Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given input `nums = []`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `asc` is initialized as a copy of `nums`, which is an empty list: `asc = []`.
   - `desc` is initialized as an empty list: `desc = []`.

2. **Reversal:**
   - `asc.reverse()` reverses `asc` in-place. Since `asc` is empty, reversing it has no effect: `asc = []`.

3. **Slicing:**
   - `desc = asc[:len(asc) // 2]` assigns the first half of `asc` to `desc`. Since `asc` is empty, `len(asc)` is 0, and `len(asc) // 2` is also 0. Thus, `desc` remains an empty list: `desc = []`.

4. **Concatenation:**
   - The function returns `desc + asc + desc`. Since both `desc` and `asc` are empty lists, their concatenation results in an empty list: `[] + [] + [] = []`.

Therefore, the output of the function `f` with the given input is an empty list.
