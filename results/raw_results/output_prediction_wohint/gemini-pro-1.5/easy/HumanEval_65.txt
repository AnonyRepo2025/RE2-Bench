Here's how we determine the output of `circular_shift(100, 2)`:

1. **Convert x to string:** The input `x = 100` is converted to the string `s = "100"`.
2. **Check shift value:** `shift = 2` is not greater than `len(s) = 3`, so the `else` block is executed.
3. **Calculate the shifted string:**
   - `s[len(s) - shift:]` is `s[3 - 2:]` which is `s[1:]`, resulting in "00".
   - `s[:len(s) - shift]` is `s[:3 - 2]` which is `s[:1]`, resulting in "1".
4. **Concatenate and return:** The function returns the concatenation of "00" and "1", which is "001".
