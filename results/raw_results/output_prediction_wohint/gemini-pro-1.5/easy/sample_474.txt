Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given inputs.

1. **txt = "#[)[]>[^e>\n 8"**
2. **marker = -5**

The function splits the input string `txt` into a list of lines using the newline character as a delimiter. In this case, the lines are:

- "#[)[]>[^e>"
- " 8"

The function then iterates through each line and applies the `center()` method with the `marker` value.  The `center()` method requires a non-negative width. Since `marker` is -5, it will raise a `ValueError`.

```
{
    "error": "ValueError: width cannot be negative"
}
```
