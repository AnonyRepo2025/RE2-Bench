Here's how `update_product_quantity` executes with the given input:

1. **Check if product_id is in inventory:** The `product_id` is 1 (an integer), while the keys in `self.inventory` are strings.  Therefore, the condition `if product_id in self.inventory:` evaluates to `False`.

2. **No update occurs:** Since the condition in the `if` statement is false, the code inside the `if` block (which updates the quantity) does not execute.  The `inventory` remains unchanged.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "output": null
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
