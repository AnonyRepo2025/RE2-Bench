The `add_employee` method checks if the given `employee_id` already exists in the `self.employees` dictionary. In this case, the `employee_id` is 1, and since the dictionary keys are strings, it checks if the string "1" exists as a key. The dictionary already has a key "1", so the method returns `False`.
