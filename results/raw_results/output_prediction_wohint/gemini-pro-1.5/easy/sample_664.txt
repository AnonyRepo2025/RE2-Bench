Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Initialization:** `resp` is initialized as an empty string.

2. **Loop 1:** The loop iterates through the keys of the `tags` dictionary. The first key encountered is "3".
   - `resp += key + ' '` adds "3 " to `resp`. `resp` is now "3 ".

3. **Loop 2:** The second key encountered is "4".
   - `resp += key + ' '` adds "4 " to `resp`. `resp` is now "3 4 ".

4. **Return:** The function returns the final value of `resp`, which is "3 4 ".
