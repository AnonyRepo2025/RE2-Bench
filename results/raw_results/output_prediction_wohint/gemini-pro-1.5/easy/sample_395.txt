Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the input `s = "11"`:

1. **Loop 1:**
   - `i = 0`
   - `s[i]` is '1'.
   - `s[i].isdecimal()` is `True`.
   - The function returns `i + (s[i] == '0')`. Since `s[i]` is '1', `s[i] == '0'` is `False`, which evaluates to 0 in this context.
   - Therefore, the function returns `0 + 0 = 0`.

The loop terminates immediately after the first iteration because of the `return` statement.
