Let's trace the execution of the function `f(d)` with the given input.

1. **Input:** The input dictionary `d` is `{"l": 1, "t": 2, "x:": 3}`.

2. **Copy:** The line `d = d.copy()` creates a shallow copy of the input dictionary. This means that modifications to the copy will not affect the original dictionary. Let's call this copy `d_copy`.

3. **popitem():** The `d.popitem()` method removes and returns an arbitrary (key, value) pair from the dictionary `d_copy`. Since the order of items in a dictionary is not guaranteed, we cannot predict which item will be removed. Let's assume for the sake of this example that the item `("x:", 3)` is removed.

4. **Return:** The function returns the modified dictionary `d_copy`, which now has the item `("x:", 3)` removed.

Therefore, the output will be the dictionary `d_copy` without the last item. Since the order is arbitrary, any of the three key-value pairs could be missing.  Let's assume ("x:", 3) was removed.
