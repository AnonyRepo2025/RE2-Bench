1. The function `_parallel_fit_estimator` receives an estimator, X, y, and sample_weight as input. In this case, sample_weight is None.
2. The estimator is a LogisticRegression object with the following parameters:
    - `solver`: "warn" (which defaults to 'liblinear')
    - `multi_class`: "warn" (which defaults to 'ovr')
3. The function calls `estimator.fit(X, y)` since `sample_weight` is None.
4. Inside `fit`:
    - `_check_solver` is called with `solver='warn'`, `penalty='l2'`, `dual=False`. It returns 'liblinear'.
    - `check_X_y` is called to validate X and y. It converts X and y to numpy arrays.
    - `check_classification_targets` checks that y represents classification targets.
    - Since `solver` is 'liblinear', `_fit_liblinear` is called. This function fits the logistic regression model and updates the `coef_`, `intercept_`, and `n_iter_` attributes of the estimator.
5. The fitted estimator is returned.

Therefore, the output will be the estimator object with updated `coef_`, `intercept_`, and `n_iter_` attributes. Since the exact values of these attributes depend on the internal implementation of `_fit_liblinear`, we cannot predict them precisely. However, we can predict the type and shape of these attributes. `coef_` will be a 2D numpy array of shape (n_classes, n_features), `intercept_` will be a 1D numpy array of shape (n_classes,), and `n_iter_` will be a 1D numpy array of shape (1,).
