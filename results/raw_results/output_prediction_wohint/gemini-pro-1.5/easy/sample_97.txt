Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given input.

1. **lst.clear():** The input list `lst` is initially empty (`[]`). The `clear()` method removes all elements from the list. Since the list is already empty, this operation doesn't change anything. `lst` remains `[]`.

2. **for i in lst:** The loop iterates over the elements of `lst`. Since `lst` is empty, the loop body is never executed.

3. **else:** The `else` block associated with the `for` loop is executed if the loop completes without encountering a `break` statement. In this case, the loop completes immediately because `lst` is empty, so the `else` block is executed.

4. **return True:** The `else` block contains the statement `return True`. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
