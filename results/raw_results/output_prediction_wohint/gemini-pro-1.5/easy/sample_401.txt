Here's how we determine the output of the function `f` given the inputs:

1. **Input:** `text` is "mathematics", and `suffix` is "example".

2. **Condition:** The `if` statement checks two conditions:
   - `suffix`: This checks if the `suffix` is not empty or None. In this case, "example" is a non-empty string, so this condition is true.
   - `text.endswith(suffix)`: This checks if the `text` ends with the given `suffix`. "mathematics" does not end with "example". So, this condition is false.

3. **Result:** Since the second condition of the `if` statement is false, the code inside the `if` block is not executed. The function returns the original `text` unchanged.
