The `get_fragment` method searches for the '#' character in the URL and returns the part of the URL after it.

1. The URL is "https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=aaa&rsv_spt=1#aaa".
2. `fragment_start = self.url.find('#')` will return the index of the first '#' character. In this case, the index is 46.
3. Since `fragment_start` is not -1, the code will return `self.url[fragment_start + 1:]`.
4. `self.url[47:]` will return the substring starting from index 47 to the end of the string, which is "aaa".
