Let's trace the execution with the given input "1 0.01":

1. **a, b = input().split()**: This line reads the input string "1 0.01" and splits it into two parts based on the space. So, `a` becomes "1" and `b` becomes "0.01".

2. **b = b[0] + b[2:]**: This line modifies `b`. `b[0]` is '0', and `b[2:]` is '01'.  Therefore, the new value of `b` becomes "001".

3. **a = int(a)**: This converts `a` from a string to an integer. So, `a` becomes 1.

4. **b = int(b)**: This converts `b` from a string to an integer. So, `b` becomes 1.

5. **print(a * b // 100)**: This calculates `1 * 1 // 100`. The result of `1 * 1` is 1. Then, integer division by 100 results in 0.

Therefore, the final output is 0.
