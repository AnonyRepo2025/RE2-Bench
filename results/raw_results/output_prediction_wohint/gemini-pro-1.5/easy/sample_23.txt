Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Initial values:**
   - `text` = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"
   - `chars` = "0123456789-"

2. **`if chars:`:** This condition is true since `chars` is a non-empty string.

3. **`text = text.rstrip(chars)`:** This removes any trailing characters present in the `chars` string from the `text`.
   - The trailing characters in `text` are " 2.2". The characters '2', '.', and ' ' are present in `chars`, so they are removed.
   - The resulting `text` becomes "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery".

4. **`if text == '':`:** This condition is false since `text` is not empty.

5. **`return text`:** The function returns the modified `text`.
