Here's how the function `f` executes with the given input:

1. **Initial values:**
   - `text` = "\"Leap and the net will appear"
   - `res` = 123

2. **Loop 1: Replacing '*'**
   - The code iterates through the characters '*\n"'.
   - The first character is '*'.
   - `text` becomes "\"Leap and the net will appear" (no change as there's no '*').

3. **Loop 2: Replacing '\n'**
   - The second character is '\n'.
   - `text` becomes "\"Leap and the net will appear" (no change as there's no newline).

4. **Loop 3: Replacing '"'**
   - The third character is '"'.
   - `text` becomes "!123Leap and the net will appear" (the leading double quote is replaced).

5. **Conditional Check:**
   - `text.startswith('!')` is `True`.
   - `text` becomes "Leap and the net will appear" (the "!123" is removed because `len(str(res))` is 3).

6. **Return:**
   - The function returns "Leap and the net will appear".
