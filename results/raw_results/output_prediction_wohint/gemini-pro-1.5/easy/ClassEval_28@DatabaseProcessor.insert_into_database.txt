The `insert_into_database` method does not return anything explicitly, so it implicitly returns `None`. The method inserts data into the specified SQLite database. Let's trace the execution:

1. **Connection:** A connection to the database `test.db` is established.
2. **Loop:** The code iterates through the `data` list.
   - **First Iteration:**
     - `item` is `{"name": "John", "age": 25}`.
     - The `INSERT` query is executed with "John" and 25 as values.
   - **Second Iteration:**
     - `item` is `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`.
     - The `INSERT` query is executed with "Alice" and 30 as values.
3. **Commit:** The changes are committed to the database.
4. **Close:** The database connection is closed.

Since the function doesn't return any value explicitly, it implicitly returns `None`.
