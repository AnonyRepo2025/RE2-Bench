Here's how we determine the output:

1. **`sublist = text[s:e]`**: This line creates a sublist of the input `text`. With `text = "happy"`, `s = 0`, and `e = 3`, the `sublist` becomes `"hap"`.

2. **`if not sublist:`**: This condition checks if the `sublist` is empty. In our case, it's not empty, so we skip the `return -1`.

3. **`return sublist.index(min(sublist))`**: This line finds the index of the minimum element within the `sublist`.
   - `min(sublist)`: The minimum character in `"hap"` is `'a'`.
   - `sublist.index('a')`: The index of `'a'` in `"hap"` is 1.

Therefore, the function returns 1.
