The `median` function calculates the median of a list of numbers. Let's trace its execution with the given input `data = [2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8]`.

1. **Sorting:** The `sorted()` function sorts the input list in ascending order:
   `sorted_data = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`

2. **Length:** The length of the sorted list is calculated:
   `n = len(sorted_data) = 7`

3. **Odd Length:** Since `n` is odd (7), the code inside the `else` block is executed.

4. **Middle Index:** The middle index is calculated:
   `middle = n // 2 = 7 // 2 = 3`

5. **Median:** The element at the middle index is returned as the median:
   `sorted_data[middle] = sorted_data[3] = 5`

Therefore, the function will return 5.
