Here's how the function `f(a, b, n)` executes with the given inputs:

1. **Initial values:**
   - `a = "unrndqafi"`
   - `b = "c"`
   - `n = 2`
   - `result = m = "c"`

2. **First loop iteration:**
   - `m` is "c". The condition `if m` is true.
   - `a.replace(m, '', 1)` attempts to replace the first occurrence of 'c' in `a`. Since 'c' is not present in `a`, `a` remains "unrndqafi".
   - `a` becomes "unrndqafi", and `m` becomes `None`.
   - `result` and `m` are reset to "c".

3. **Second loop iteration:**
   - `m` is "c". The condition `if m` is true.
   - `a.replace(m, '', 1)` attempts to replace the first occurrence of 'c' in `a`. Since 'c' is not present in `a`, `a` remains "unrndqafi".
   - `a` becomes "unrndqafi", and `m` becomes `None`.
   - `result` and `m` are reset to "c".

4. **After the loop:**
   - `result` is "c".
   - `a.split(b)` splits `a` by "c". Since "c" is not in `a`, the result is a list containing only `a`: `["unrndqafi"]`.
   - `result.join(a.split(b))` joins the elements of the list `["unrndqafi"]` with "c" as the separator. Since there's only one element, the result is simply "unrndqafi".
