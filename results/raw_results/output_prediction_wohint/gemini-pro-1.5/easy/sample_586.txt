The `rindex()` method in Python returns the highest index in the string where the substring is found. If the substring is not found, it raises a `ValueError`.

In this case, the string `text` is "breakfast" and the character `char` is "e".

The character "e" appears twice in "breakfast": at index 1 and at index 6. Since `rindex()` returns the *highest* index, the function will return 6.
