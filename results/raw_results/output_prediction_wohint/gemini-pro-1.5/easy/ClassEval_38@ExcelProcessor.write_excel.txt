The `write_excel` function takes a list of lists (representing rows of data) and a file name as input. It creates an Excel workbook, adds the data to the active sheet row by row, saves the workbook to the specified file, and returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.

In this case, the data is provided as a list of lists, and the file name is "test_data_process.xlsx". The function will create an Excel file named "test_data_process.xlsx" with the given data. Since the input is valid and no exceptions are expected, the function will return 1.
