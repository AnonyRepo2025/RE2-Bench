Here's how the function `f` executes with the given inputs:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `full = "hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy"`
   - `part = "hr"`
   - `length = len(part) = 2`
   - `index = full.find(part) = 0` (first occurrence of "hr" is at index 0)
   - `count = 0`

2. **First loop iteration:**
   - `full = full[index + length:] = full[0 + 2:] = "siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy"`
   - `index = full.find(part) = 8` (next occurrence of "hr" is at index 8)
   - `count += 1 = 1`

3. **Second loop iteration:**
   - `full = full[index + length:] = full[8 + 2:] = "uejfhbrisvlmmy"`
   - `index = full.find(part) = -1` ("hr" is not found in the remaining string)
   - `count += 1 = 2` (This line is not reached because the loop condition is `index >= 0`)

4. **Loop termination:** The `while` loop terminates because `index` is now -1.

5. **Return:** The function returns the final value of `count`, which is 2.
