The function `f` reverses the input string `text`.

1. The `for` loop iterates from `len(text) - 1` down to 0. In our case, `len("was,")` is 4, so the loop iterates from 3 down to 0.
2. In each iteration, the character at index `i` is appended to the `result` string.

- i = 3: `result += text[3]` which is ',' so `result` becomes ','
- i = 2: `result += text[2]` which is 's' so `result` becomes ',s'
- i = 1: `result += text[1]` which is 'a' so `result` becomes ',sa'
- i = 0: `result += text[0]` which is 'w' so `result` becomes ',saw'

Therefore, the final returned string is ',saw'.
