The `splitlines()` method splits a string into a list of strings, using newline characters as delimiters. Let's trace the execution:

1. **Input:** `text` is "145\n\n12fjkjg".
2. **splitlines():** The string is split into a list of strings wherever a newline character ('\n') is encountered.
3. **Resulting list:** The list `s` will be `['145', '', '12fjkjg']`. Notice that consecutive newline characters result in empty strings in the list.
4. **len(s):** The `len()` function returns the number of elements in the list `s`. In this case, there are 3 elements.

Therefore, the function will return 3.
