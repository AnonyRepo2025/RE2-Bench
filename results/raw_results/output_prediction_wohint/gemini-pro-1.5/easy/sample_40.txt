The `ljust` function pads the string on the right with a given character (in this case, '#') until it reaches a specified length.

The input string is "the cow goes moo". Its length is 16.
The desired length is len(text) + 1, which is 16 + 1 = 17.
Therefore, the string will be padded with one '#' character at the end.
