Here's how we determine the output of the function `f` with the given input:

1. **Input string:** `st = "Hi there"`

2. **Lowercase conversion:** `st.lower()` becomes `"hi there"`

3. **First `rindex('i')`:** This finds the index of the last occurrence of 'i' in the lowercase string. In "hi there", the last 'i' is at index 1.

4. **Second `rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i'))`:** This searches for the last occurrence of 'h' *before or at* the index found in the previous step (which is 1).  So, it searches for 'h' in "h". The last 'h' is at index 0.

5. **Comparison:** The code compares the index of the last 'h' found (0) with the index of the last 'i' found (1).  The condition `0 >= 1` is `False`.

6. **Return value:** Since the condition is false, the `else` block is executed, returning "Hi".
