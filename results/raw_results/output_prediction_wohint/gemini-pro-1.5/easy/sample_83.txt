Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given input "qq0tt".

1. **`l = text.rpartition('0')`**: This partitions the string `text` into three parts based on the last occurrence of '0'.
   - `l[0]` will be the part before the last '0': "qq"
   - `l[1]` will be the last occurrence of '0': "0"
   - `l[2]` will be the part after the last '0': "tt"

2. **`if l[2] == '':`**: This condition checks if the part after the last '0' is empty. In our case, `l[2]` is "tt", which is not empty. So, the `if` block is skipped.

3. **`return f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find('0') + 1}'`**: This line constructs the return string.
   - `len(l[0])`: The length of "qq" is 2.
   - `l[2].find('0')`: This searches for the index of '0' within "tt". Since '0' is not present in "tt", `find()` returns -1.
   - `l[2].find('0') + 1`: -1 + 1 = 0.

Therefore, the function returns "2:0".
