The function `f(a, b)` merges two dictionaries `a` and `b`. If there are common keys, the values from dictionary `b` will overwrite the values from dictionary `a`.

In this case, `a` is `{"w": 5, "wi": 10}` and `b` is `{"w": 3}`.
The key `"w"` is present in both dictionaries. The value of `"w"` in the merged dictionary will be the value from `b`, which is 3. The key `"wi"` is only present in `a`.

The resulting dictionary will be `{"w": 3, "wi": 10}`.
