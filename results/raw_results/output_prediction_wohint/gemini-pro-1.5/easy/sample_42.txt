Let's trace the execution of the function `f(nums)` with the given input `nums = []`.

1. **nums.clear():** This line clears the list `nums`. Since `nums` is already empty, this operation doesn't change anything. `nums` remains `[]`.

2. **for num in nums:** This loop iterates through the elements of `nums`. Since `nums` is empty, the loop body is not executed.

3. **return nums:** The function returns the modified `nums`, which is still an empty list `[]`.
