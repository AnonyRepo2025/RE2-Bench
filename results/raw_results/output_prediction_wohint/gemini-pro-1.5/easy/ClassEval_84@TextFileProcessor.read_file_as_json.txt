The `read_file_as_json` method attempts to open the file specified by `file_path`, which is "test_2.txt", and parse its contents as JSON.  Since we don't have the actual contents of "test_2.txt", we can't determine the exact output.  We need to know what's in "test_2.txt" to predict the output of the function.  If "test_2.txt" contains valid JSON, the function will return a Python object representing that JSON data (e.g., a dictionary, list, string, number, boolean, or null). If "test_2.txt" does not exist or contains invalid JSON, the function will raise an exception (FileNotFoundError or JSONDecodeError, respectively).

Assuming "test_2.txt" contains the following valid JSON:

```json
{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```

Then the output would be:

```json
{
    "output": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "New York"
    }
}
```

[OUTPUT]
```json
{
    "output": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "New York"
    }
}
```
