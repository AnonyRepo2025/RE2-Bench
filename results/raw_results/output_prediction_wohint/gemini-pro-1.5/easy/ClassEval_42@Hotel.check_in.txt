Here's how the `check_in` method executes with the given input:

1. **`if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys():`**: `room_type` is "single", and "single" is a key in `self.booked_rooms`, so this condition is `False`. The code proceeds to the next block.

2. **`if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]:`**: `name` is "guest 1". `self.booked_rooms["single"]` is an empty dictionary `{}`. Thus, "guest 1" is not in this dictionary. This condition is `False`.  The method returns `False`.
