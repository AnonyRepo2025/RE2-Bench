The function `f` searches for the `target` value within the `items` list. If the target is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence. Otherwise, it returns -1.

In this case, `items` is `["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]` and `target` is `"**"`.

The `target` "**" is present in the `items` list at index 3.
