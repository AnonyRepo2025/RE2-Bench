Let's trace the execution of the function `f` with the given input `a = [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `b` is initialized as a copy of `a`: `b = [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`

2. **Loop 1 (k = 0):**
   - `b.insert(0 + 1, b[0])` inserts `b[0]` (which is 5) at index 1.
   - `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`

3. **Loop 2 (k = 2):**
   - `b.insert(2 + 1, b[2])` inserts `b[2]` (which is 5) at index 3.
   - `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`

4. **Loop 3 (k = 4):**
   - `b.insert(4 + 1, b[4])` inserts `b[4]` (which is 5) at index 5.
   - `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`

5. **Append:**
   - `b.append(b[0])` appends `b[0]` (which is 5) to the end of `b`.
   - `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9, 5]`

Therefore, the final value of `b` is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9, 5]`.
