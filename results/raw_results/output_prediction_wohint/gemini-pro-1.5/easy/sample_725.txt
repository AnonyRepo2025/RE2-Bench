The function `f` takes a string `text` as input.
1. It initializes a list `result_list` with four '3's.
2. It checks if `result_list` is not empty. Since it's initialized with elements, the condition is true.
3. Inside the `if` block, `result_list.clear()` removes all elements from the list, making it empty.
4. Finally, the function returns the length of the input string `text`.

In this case, the input `text` is "mrq7y". The length of this string is 5. Therefore, the function will return 5.
