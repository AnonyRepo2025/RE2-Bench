Let's trace the execution of the function `f(s, l)` with `s = "urecord"` and `l = 8`.

1. `s.ljust(l, '=')`: This part left-justifies the string `s` within a field of width `l` by padding it with `=` characters on the right. Since `s` has length 7 and `l` is 8, the result is "urecord=".

2. `.rpartition('=')`: This partitions the string from the right based on the separator `=`. It returns a tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. In our case, the string is "urecord=". The rightmost `=` is the separator. So, the tuple will be ("urecord", "=", "").

3. `[0]`: This extracts the first element of the tuple, which is the part before the rightmost `=`. In our case, it's "urecord".

Therefore, the function returns "urecord".
