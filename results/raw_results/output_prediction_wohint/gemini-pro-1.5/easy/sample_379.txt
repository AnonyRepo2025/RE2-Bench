Let's trace the execution of the function `f(nums)` with `nums = []`.

1. **`for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -3):`**:
   - `len(nums)` is 0.
   - `len(nums) - 1` is -1.
   - The `range` function with arguments `(start=-1, stop=-1, step=-3)` will not execute any iterations. The loop condition is checked before each iteration. In this case, the initial value of `i` would be -1. Since the step is -3 and the stop value is -1, the loop terminates immediately without entering the body.

2. **`return nums`**: Since the loop doesn't execute, the function returns the original `nums` list, which is empty.
