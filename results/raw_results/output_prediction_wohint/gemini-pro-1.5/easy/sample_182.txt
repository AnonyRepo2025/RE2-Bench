The function `f` takes a dictionary `dic` as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a key-value pair from the input dictionary. The list is sorted alphabetically by the keys.

In this case, the input dictionary `dic` is `{"b": 1, "a": 2}`.

The `dic.items()` method returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.  For the given `dic`, `dic.items()` would produce something like: `dict_items([('b', 1), ('a', 2)])`.

The `sorted()` function, with the `key=lambda x: x[0]` argument, sorts the items based on the first element of each tuple (which is the key).

Therefore, the `sorted(dic.items(), key=lambda x: x[0])` will sort the items alphabetically by key, resulting in `[('a', 2), ('b', 1)]`.
