1. The function `f` takes `array` and `list` as input.
2. `array.extend(list)` modifies `array` in-place by appending the elements of `list` to it. So, `array` becomes `[2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1]`.
3. The list comprehension `[e for e in array if e % 2 == 0]` creates a new list containing only the even numbers from `array`. However, this new list is not assigned to any variable, so it doesn't affect the final result.
4. The return statement `return [e for e in array if e >= 10]` creates a new list containing elements from `array` that are greater than or equal to 10. In our modified `array`, these elements are 15, 15, 15.
5. Therefore, the function returns `[15, 15, 15]`.
