Here's how the execution flows:

1. **Check if `name` is in `student_marks`:** The `name` provided is "6f53p". The `student_marks` dictionary contains only one key-value pair: {"882afmfp": 56}. Since "6f53p" is not a key in `student_marks`, the condition `name in student_marks` evaluates to `False`.

2. **Return 'Name unknown':** Since the condition in the `if` statement is `False`, the code inside the `if` block is skipped. The function then proceeds to the `return 'Name unknown'` statement.

Therefore, the function will return "Name unknown".
