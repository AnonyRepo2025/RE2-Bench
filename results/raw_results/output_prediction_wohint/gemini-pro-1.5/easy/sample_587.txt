Let's trace the execution of the function `f(nums, fill)` with the given inputs.

1. `nums` is the list `[0, 1, 1, 2]`.
2. `fill` is the string `"abcca"`.
3. `ans = dict.fromkeys(nums, fill)` creates a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements of `nums` and the value associated with each key is `fill`.

The `dict.fromkeys()` method creates a dictionary where all keys point to the same object in memory.  This means if you modify the value associated with one key, it will affect all keys. However, in this case, the value is a string, which is immutable in Python. So, even though all keys initially point to the same string object, any subsequent modification to the string will create a new string object, leaving the original string unchanged.

The unique elements in `nums` are `0`, `1`, and `2`. So, the resulting dictionary will be:
```
{
    0: "abcca",
    1: "abcca",
    2: "abcca"
}
```
