The function `f(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with all occurrences of 'a' and 'r' removed.

Given the input `s = "rpaar"`, let's trace the execution:

1. `s.replace('a', '')`: This removes all occurrences of 'a' from the string.  `s` becomes "rpr".
2. `.replace('r', '')`: This removes all occurrences of 'r' from the modified string. `s` becomes "p".

Therefore, the final output is "p".
