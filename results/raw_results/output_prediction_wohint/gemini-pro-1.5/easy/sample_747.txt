Here's how we determine the output of the function `f` with the given input:

1. **Initial Check:** The input `text` is "123E-10". The function first checks if `text` is equal to "42.42". Since it's not, the code moves to the loop.

2. **Looping through the string:** The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `len(text) - 3 -1 = 7 - 3 - 1 = 3`. So, the loop only runs for `i = 3`.

3. **Condition inside the loop:**
   - `text[i]` is `text[3]` which is 'E'.
   - `text[i-3:]` is `text[0:]` which is "123E-10". This is not a digit string due to 'E' and '-'.
   - `text[:i]` is `text[:3]` which is "123". This is a digit string.

   Since `text[i-3:]` is not a digit string, the condition `text[i] == '.' and text[i - 3:].isdigit() and text[:i].isdigit()` is false.

4. **Loop Completion and Default Return:** The loop finishes without returning `True`. Therefore, the function returns `False`.
