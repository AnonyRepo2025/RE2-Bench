The `set_target_temperature` method simply updates the `target_temperature` attribute of the `Thermostat` object to the provided `temperature` argument.

Initially, the `Thermostat` object has a `target_temperature` of 25. The method is called with `temperature = 10`. Therefore, the `target_temperature` attribute will be updated to 10. The method doesn't return anything explicitly, so it implicitly returns `None`.
