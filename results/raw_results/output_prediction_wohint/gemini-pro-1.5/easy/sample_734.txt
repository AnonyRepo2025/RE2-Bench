Let's trace the execution of the function `f(nums)` with `nums = [5, 3, 3, 7]`.

1. **Initial state:** `nums = [5, 3, 3, 7]`
2. **Loop 1:**
   - `i = len(nums) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2`
   - `nums[2] = 3`
   - `3 % 2 == 0` is false. So, no element is removed.
3. **Loop 2:**
   - `i = 1`
   - `nums[1] = 3`
   - `3 % 2 == 0` is false. So, no element is removed.
4. **Loop 3:**
   - `i = 0`
   - `nums[0] = 5`
   - `5 % 2 == 0` is false. So, no element is removed.

Since no even numbers are present in the input list, the function will return the original list unchanged.
