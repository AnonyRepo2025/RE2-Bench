The `extract_file` method attempts to extract a file named `example5.txt` from the zip archive `example.zip` and save it to the directory `output_directory`.  Since we don't have the actual `example.zip` file to test with, we can only predict the output based on whether `example5.txt` exists within `example.zip`.  The problem description doesn't tell us the contents of `example.zip`.  Therefore, we must assume that `example5.txt` *does not* exist in the archive, and the extraction will fail, raising an exception within the `try...except` block.  This will cause the function to return `False`.
