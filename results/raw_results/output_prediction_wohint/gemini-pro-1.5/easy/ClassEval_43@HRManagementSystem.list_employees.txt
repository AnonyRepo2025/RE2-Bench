Here's how `list_employees` will execute:

1. **Initialization:** `employee_data` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
2. **Check for Employees:** The `if self.employees` condition is met because `self.employees` is not empty.
3. **Looping through Employees:** The code iterates through the `self.employees` dictionary. In this case, there's only one employee with ID "1".
4. **Creating Employee Details:** Inside the loop, `employee_details` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
5. **Adding Employee ID:** The employee's ID ("1") is added to `employee_details` with the key "employee_ID".
6. **Adding Other Details:** The code then iterates through the employee's information (name, position, department, salary) and adds each key-value pair to `employee_details`.
7. **Adding to `employee_data`:** Finally, `employee_details` (which now contains all the employee's information) is added to `employee_data` with the employee ID ("1") as the key.

Therefore, the `employee_data` dictionary will be:

```
{
    "1": {
        "employee_ID": "1",
        "name": "John",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 100000
    }
}
```

```json

    "output": {
        "1": {
            "employee_ID": "1",
            "name": "John",
            "position": "Manager",
            "department": "Sales",
            "salary": 100000
        }
    }
}
```
