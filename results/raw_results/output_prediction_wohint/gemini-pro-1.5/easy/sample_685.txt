The function `f` takes an array and an element as input. It returns the number of times the element appears in the array plus the element itself.

In this case, the array is `[1, 1, 1]` and the element is `-2`.

The `array.count(elem)` will return the number of times `-2` appears in the array `[1, 1, 1]`. Since `-2` is not present in the array, the count will be 0.

Then, the function returns `0 + (-2)`, which is `-2`.
