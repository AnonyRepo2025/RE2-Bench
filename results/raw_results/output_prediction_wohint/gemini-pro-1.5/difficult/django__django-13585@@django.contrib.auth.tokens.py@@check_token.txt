1. **Initial checks:** `user` and `token` are not None.
2. **Token splitting:** `ts_b36` becomes "coo5bv" and `legacy_token` is False (because length of "coo5bv" is 6, which is not less than 4).
3. **Timestamp conversion:** `ts` becomes `base36_to_int("coo5bv")` which is 13835059.
4. **Token comparison:** The core logic lies in comparing the provided token with a generated token.
   - It calls `self._make_token_with_timestamp(user, ts)` with `legacy=False`.
5. **Inside `_make_token_with_timestamp`:**
   - `ts_b36` remains "coo5bv".
   - `hash_string` is calculated as follows:
     - `self._make_hash_value(user, timestamp)` returns "1md5$YbSnGA0Tetrj$704b247ccdb4be0f0f5df96a453b648c13835059test2@example.com".
     - `salted_hmac` is used with the above string, `key_salt`, `secret="abcdefghijkl"`, and `algorithm="sha256"`. This produces a hex digest.
     - The hex digest is sliced with `[::2]` (taking every second character).
     - Let's assume the resulting `hash_string` is "92cebe54064db62bd060fb49891f8efe" (This is derived from the input token, as the question doesn't provide `settings.SECRET_KEY` to calculate the actual hash).
   - The function returns "coo5bv-92cebe54064db62bd060fb49891f8efe".
6. **Comparison result:** The generated token matches the provided token.
7. **Timestamp check:**
   - `now` is the current datetime.
   - `self._num_seconds(now)` calculates the number of seconds from 2001-01-01 to `now`.
   - The difference between `self._num_seconds(now)` and `ts` is checked against `settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT`. We don't have the value of `settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT` or the exact current time, but since the generated token matches the provided one, let's assume the time difference is within the timeout.
8. **Final result:** The function returns `True`.
