1. **`use_l10n` determination:** Since `use_l10n` is `None`, the code checks `settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL`. If that doesn't exist, it falls back to `settings.USE_L10N`. Let's assume `settings.USE_L10N` is False (a common scenario when testing or when localization is explicitly disabled).

2. **Cache lookup:** The function attempts to retrieve the format from `_format_cache`. Since this is likely the first call with this format type, the cache will be empty.

3. **`use_l10n` check:** Because `use_l10n` is False, the code skips the localization-specific format lookup.

4. **`FORMAT_SETTINGS` check:** The code checks if `format_type` ("jS \\o\\f F") is present in `FORMAT_SETTINGS`. It's not.

5. **Return `format_type`:** Since the format type is not in `FORMAT_SETTINGS` and localization is disabled, the function returns the input `format_type` directly.
