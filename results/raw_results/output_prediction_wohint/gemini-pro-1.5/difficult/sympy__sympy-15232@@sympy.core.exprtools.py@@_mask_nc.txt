Let's trace the execution of `_mask_nc` with the given input.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `expr` is set to `x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n`.
   - `rep`, `nc_obj`, and `nc_syms` are initialized as empty lists/sets.

2. **Preorder Traversal:**
   - The `preorder_traversal` function iterates through the expression tree.
   - It checks for non-commutative objects. In this case, `n`, `m`, `o` are non-commutative symbols, and `x` is commutative.

3. **Conditions and Appending to `rep`:**
   - The code checks if the current object `a` is already in `rep`.
   - If `a` is a non-commutative Symbol, it's added to `nc_syms`.
   - If `a` is non-commutative and not an Add, Mul, or Pow, it's added to `nc_obj`. However, this condition is not met in this example.

4. **After Traversal:**
   - `nc_obj` is empty.
   - `nc_syms` contains `n`, `m`, and `o`.

5. **Dummy Replacement:**
   - Since `len(nc_syms)` is 3 (not 1) and `nc_obj` is empty, the next condition is not met.
   - The code sorts `nc_syms` alphabetically, resulting in `m`, `n`, `o`.
   - It creates Dummy variables for each of these symbols and appends the replacements to `rep`.

6. **Substitution:**
   - `expr` is updated by substituting the original non-commutative symbols with their Dummy counterparts.

7. **Return:**
   - The function returns the modified `expr`, a dictionary mapping Dummy variables back to the original symbols, and the list of non-commutative Dummy symbols.

Therefore, the final `expr` will be a sum of products of Dummy variables, the dictionary will map these Dummy variables back to `m`, `n`, and `o`, and the list of non-commutative symbols will contain the Dummy variables.
