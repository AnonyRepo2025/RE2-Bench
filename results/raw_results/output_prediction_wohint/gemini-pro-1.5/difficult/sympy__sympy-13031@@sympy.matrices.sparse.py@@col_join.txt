1. **Initial state:**
   - `self` is an empty MutableSparseMatrix (0x0).
   - `other` is a 2x1 matrix.

2. **Inside `col_join`:**
   - The first `if` condition is met (`self.rows == 0` and `self.cols != other.cols`).
   - The function recursively calls itself with:
     - `self`: a new empty MutableSparseMatrix with dimensions 0x1 (matching `other.cols`).
     - `other`: the original 2x1 matrix.

3. **Second recursive call:**
   - `self` is now a 0x1 MutableSparseMatrix.
   - `other` is still the 2x1 matrix.
   - The first `if` condition is *not* met.
   - `A` becomes a copy of the 0x1 empty matrix.
   - The `if not isinstance(B, SparseMatrix)` branch is taken because `other` is not a SparseMatrix.
   - The loop iterates through `other` but since `other._mat` is `null`, no values are added to `A._smat`.
   - `A.rows` becomes `0 + 2 = 2`.

4. **Return:**
   - The function returns `A`, which is a 2x1 MutableSparseMatrix with no elements in `_smat`.
