1. The `transform` method calls `_transform_selected` with the provided X, `_transform` method, dtype, categorical_features, and copy=True. Since categorical_features is "all", `_transform_selected` directly calls `_transform` with the provided X.
2. Inside `_transform`, X is checked and converted to a numpy array: `X = np.array([[4, 1, 1]])`.
3. `n_samples`, `n_features` become 1 and 3, respectively.
4. `indices` is `self.feature_indices_`, which is `[0 2 5 9]`.
5. The code checks if `n_features` matches the expected number of features based on `indices`. Here, `n_features` is 3 and `indices.shape[0] - 1` is also 3, so the check passes.
6. `mask = (X < self.n_values_).ravel()`. `self.n_values_` is `[2 3 4]`. So, the comparison is `[[4 1 1]] < [[2 3 4]]`, which results in `[[False True True]]`. `mask` becomes `[False True True]`.
7. Since `handle_unknown` is "ignore", the code proceeds without raising an error despite `np.any(~mask)` being True.
8. `column_indices = (X + indices[:-1]).ravel()[mask]`. This becomes `([4 1 1] + [0 2 5]).ravel()[mask]`, which simplifies to `[4 3 6][mask]`. Applying the mask `[False True True]` results in `[3 6]`.
9. `row_indices = np.repeat(np.arange(n_samples, dtype=np.int32), n_features)[mask]`. This becomes `np.repeat([0], 3)[mask]`, which is `[0 0 0][mask]`. Applying the mask results in `[0 0]`.
10. `data = np.ones(np.sum(mask))` becomes `np.ones(2)`, which is `[1. 1.]`.
11. `out` is constructed as a sparse matrix with shape (1, 9). The non-zero entries are at (0, 3) and (0, 6) with values 1.
12. Since `n_values` is 'auto', `out` is sliced by `self.active_features_`, which is `[0 1 2 4 6 7 8]`. So, the final `out` will only have columns corresponding to these indices. The resulting matrix will have shape (1, 7). The non-zero entries will be at (0, 1) which was originally (0,3) and (0, 4) which was originally (0, 6), both with value 1.
13. Since `self.sparse` is True, the sparse matrix is returned.
