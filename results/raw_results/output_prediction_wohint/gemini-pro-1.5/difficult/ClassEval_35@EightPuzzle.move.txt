The `move` function takes the current state and a direction, and returns the new state after moving the blank tile (represented by 0) in the specified direction.

1. **find_blank(state)**: The function first finds the position of the blank tile (0) in the given state. In this case, the blank tile is at position (1, 2).

2. **move(state, direction)**: The function then creates a copy of the current state using `new_state = [row[:] for row in state]`. This is important to avoid modifying the original state.

3. The `direction` is "left". So, the code will execute the following line:
   `new_state[i][j], new_state[i][j - 1] = (new_state[i][j - 1], new_state[i][j])`
   Here, `i = 1` and `j = 2`. So, the values at `new_state[1][2]` (which is 0) and `new_state[1][1]` (which is 8) will be swapped.

4. The `new_state` after the swap will be:
   ```
   [
       [1, 6, 2],
       [7, 0, 8],
       [4, 5, 3]
   ]
   ```
