Here's how `fit` will execute with the given input:

1. **Input Check:** The input `X` is `null`.  However, the `fit` method of `FeatureUnion` first calls `_parallel_func` with `_fit_one` as the target function.

2. **_parallel_func:** This method iterates through the `transformer_list`.  Crucially, if `transformer_list` is empty (which it effectively is since `self.steps` is null, and therefore `self.transformer_list` hasn't been initialized), the loop in `_parallel_func` won't run.  The result is an empty list returned by `Parallel`.

3. **Empty Result Handling:** Back in `fit`, the code checks if `transformers` (the result from `_parallel_func`) is empty.  Since it is, the function immediately returns `self`.

Therefore, the output will be the `FeatureUnion` object itself, with no transformations applied because there were no transformers defined.

```
{
    "self": {
        "steps": null,
        "memory": null,
        "verbose": false
    }
}
