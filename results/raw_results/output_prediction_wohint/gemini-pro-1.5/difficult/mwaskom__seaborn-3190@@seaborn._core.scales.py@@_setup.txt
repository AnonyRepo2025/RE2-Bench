1. **Copy and default setup:** A copy of the `self` object is created. Since `_tick_params` and `_label_params` are not None, the `tick()` and `label()` methods are not called.

2. **Transformation:** `_get_transform()` is called with `trans="log"`. This will return a log transform function and its inverse.

3. **Matplotlib scale:** `_get_scale()` is called with the data name ("x"), the forward log transform, and the inverse log transform. This creates a Matplotlib scale object.

4. **Axis:** Since `axis` is None, a `PseudoAxis` is created using the Matplotlib scale. The units of the axis are updated with the data. Default locators and formatters are set on the Matplotlib scale.

5. **Normalization:** `prop.normed` is False (default), so `normalize`, `vmin`, and `vmax` are set to None.

6. **Pipeline:** A pipeline of functions is created: `[axis.convert_units, forward, normalize, prop.get_mapping(new, data)]`. Note that `normalize` is None. `prop.get_mapping` will likely return an identity function since no mapping is specified.

7. **Spacer:** A `spacer` function is created, which calculates the minimum difference between unique, non-missing values in a series.

8. **Legend:** `prop.legend` is False (default), so no legend is created.


Therefore, the output will be the modified `self` object with updated `_matplotlib_scale`, `_pipeline`, and `_spacer` attributes. `_legend` remains None. The exact values of `_matplotlib_scale` and `_pipeline` depend on the internal implementation of these methods and cannot be fully determined without more context.
