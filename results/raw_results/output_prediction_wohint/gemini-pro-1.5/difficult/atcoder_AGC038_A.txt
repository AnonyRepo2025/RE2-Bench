Let's trace the execution with H=1000, W=1000, A=0, and B=486.

The code initializes a 2D array `answer` of size HxW with '0'.

The code iterates through the array using nested loops.

- **Outer loop (i):** from 0 to H-1 (999)
- **Inner loop (j):** from 0 to W-1 (999)

Inside the loops, the code checks the following conditions:

1. **if i < B:** (i < 486)
   - **if j < A:** (j < 0) - This condition will never be true since j starts from 0.
   - **else:** `answer[i][j] = '1'` - For i < 486, all columns (j from 0 to 999) will be set to '1'.

2. **elif j < A:** (j < 0) - This condition will never be true.

3. **else:** `answer[i][j] = '0'` - This condition will only be reached when i >= 486. In this case, all columns (j from 0 to 999) will be set to '0'.

Finally, the code prints the `answer` array row by row.

So, the output will have 486 rows of all '1's, followed by (1000 - 486) = 514 rows of all '0's.
