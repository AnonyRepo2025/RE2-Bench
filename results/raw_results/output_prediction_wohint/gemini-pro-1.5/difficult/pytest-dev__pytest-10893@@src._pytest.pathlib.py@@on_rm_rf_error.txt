Let's trace the execution of `on_rm_rf_error` with the given input.

1. **Check excinfo:** `excinfo` is an empty dictionary, so the code will not enter the `if isinstance(excinfo, BaseException):` block. Instead, it tries to access `excinfo[1]`, which will raise a `KeyError`. Since this exception is not handled, the function will terminate and raise a `KeyError`.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "exception_type": "KeyError",
    "exception_message": "'1'"
}
```
