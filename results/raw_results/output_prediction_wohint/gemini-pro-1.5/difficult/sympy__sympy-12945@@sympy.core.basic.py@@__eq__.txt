1. **Initial Checks:**
   - `self is other`: False, as `self` is a Basic object and `other` is a string.
   - `type(self)` is not `type(other)`: True

2. **Sympification of `other`:**
   - The code attempts to convert `other` to a SymPy object using `_sympify("I*x")`. This creates a `Mul` object representing the product of the imaginary unit `I` and the symbol `x`.

3. **Type Comparison After Sympification:**
   - `type(self)` is still not equal to `type(other)` after sympification.

4. **Pow Special Case Check:**
   - The code checks if `self` is a `Pow` object with exponent 1, or if the sympified `other` is a `Pow` object with exponent 1. Neither condition is met.

5. **_hashable_content Comparison:**
   - Finally, the code compares `self._hashable_content()` with `other._hashable_content()`. Since the types are different, this comparison will return `False`.

Therefore, the final result of `__eq__` will be `False`.
