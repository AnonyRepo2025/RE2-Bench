Let's trace the execution of the `restify` function with the given input.

1. **Initial Check:** The input `cls` is not `None`, `NoneType`, or `Ellipsis`.

2. **INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES Check:** The input `cls` is not in `INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES`.

3. **isNewType Check:**
   - `safe_getattr(cls, '__module__', None)` returns `"tests.test_util_typing"`.
   - `safe_getattr(cls, '__qualname__', None)` returns `None` (since it's not provided in the input).
   - Thus, `isNewType(cls)` returns `False`.

4. **types_Union Check:** The code doesn't provide information about whether `cls` is an instance of `types_Union`, so we assume it's not.

5. **__module__ Check:** `cls.__module__` is `"tests.test_util_typing"`, which is neither `"__builtin__"` nor `"builtins"`.

6. **Python Version Check:** The code checks if `sys.version_info >= (3, 7)`. We don't have this information, but the outcome only determines which helper function (`_restify_py37` or `_restify_py36`) is called.  Since neither of these functions are provided, we can't determine the exact output string. However, we know the general format.

7. **_restify_py36 (assumed):**  Since we don't know the python version, and we don't have the implementation of either `_restify_py37` or `_restify_py36`, we'll assume the `else` branch is taken, which would likely call `_restify_py36` in a real execution if the Python version were less than 3.7.  We don't have the implementation of `_restify_py36`, but based on the other branches, it's likely to return a string representing the class, probably including the module and class name.

Since we don't have the implementation of `_restify_py36` or `_restify_py37`, we can't determine the precise output.  However, we can predict the general structure.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
  "output": ":class:`tests.test_util_typing.<cls_name>`" 
}
```
[/OUTPUT]

Note: `<cls_name>` represents the actual name of the class, which is not provided in the input.  If we had the implementation of `_restify_py36` or `_restify_py37` (and knew the Python version), we could determine the exact output.  If the input class had a `__qualname__` attribute, the output might include that as well.
