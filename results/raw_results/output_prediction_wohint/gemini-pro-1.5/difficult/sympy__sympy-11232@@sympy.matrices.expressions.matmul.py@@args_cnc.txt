Let's trace the execution of `args_cnc` with the given empty input.

1. **`self.as_coeff_matrices()`**: This method splits `self.args` into scalar and matrix parts. Since `self.args` is empty, both `scalars` and `matrices` lists will be empty. Consequently, `coeff` will be `Mul(*[])`, which evaluates to 1. The method returns `(1, [])`.

2. **`coeff.args_cnc(**kwargs)`**: This call is made on the `coeff` obtained in the previous step, which is 1.  `args_cnc` for an Integer object like 1 returns two lists. The first list contains commutative arguments, and the second contains non-commutative arguments. For 1, the commutative part is `[1]` (or sometimes `{1}` if it's a set), and the non-commutative part is an empty list `[]`.

3. **Conditional checks**: The code then checks if `coeff_c` is `[1]` or `{1}` and sets it to `[]` or `set()` respectively. In our case, `coeff_c` is `[1]`, so it becomes `[]`.

4. **Return**: Finally, the function returns `(coeff_c, coeff_nc + matrices)`.  `coeff_c` is now `[]`, `coeff_nc` is `[]`, and `matrices` is `[]`. Therefore, the function returns `([], [])`.
