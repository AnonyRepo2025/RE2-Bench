1. **Check Input Types and Shapes:**
   - `Gram` is a 12x12 matrix.
   - `Xy` is a 12x1 matrix.
   - `n_nonzero_coefs` is 1.
   - `tol` is None.
   - `norms_squared` is a list containing a single element.

2. **Main Loop:** The code iterates through each column of `Xy`. Since `Xy` has only one column, the loop runs once.

3. **Inside _gram_omp:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `indices` is initialized as `[0, 1, ..., 11]`.
     - `alpha` is initialized as `Xy`.
     - `n_active` is 0.
     - `max_features` is 1 (because `tol` is None and `n_nonzero_coefs` is 1).

   - **First Iteration of while loop:**
     - `lam = np.argmax(np.abs(alpha))`. This finds the index of the largest absolute value in `alpha` (which is `Xy`).  `alpha` is `[[ 0.1260535 ], [-0.4460294 ], [ 0.29305911], [-0.84156526], [ 2.15579371], [-1.60930398], [-0.25892627], [-1.34654783], [ 1.24704881], [ 0.66923821], [-0.16778773], [-0.09414498]]`. The index of the maximum absolute value (2.15579371) is 4. So, `lam` = 4.
     - The `if n_active > 0` block is skipped because `n_active` is 0.
     - `L[0, 0] = sqrt(Gram[lam, lam]) = sqrt(Gram[4, 4]) = sqrt(1.0) = 1.0`.
     - Swapping is performed:
       - `Gram[0]` and `Gram[4]` are swapped.
       - `Gram[:, 0]` and `Gram[:, 4]` are swapped.
       - `indices[0]` and `indices[4]` are swapped.
       - `Xy[0]` and `Xy[4]` are swapped.
     - `n_active` becomes 1.
     - `gamma` is calculated using `potrs`. Since `L[:n_active, :n_active]` is just `[[1.0]]` and `Xy[:n_active]` is `[2.15579371]`, `gamma` becomes `[2.15579371]`.
     - `beta = np.dot(Gram[:, :n_active], gamma)`.
     - `alpha = Xy - beta`.
     - The loop breaks because `n_active == max_features`.

4. **Return Value:** The function returns `(gamma, indices[:n_active], n_active)`.
   - `gamma` is `[2.15579371]`.
   - `indices[:n_active]` is `[4]`.
   - `n_active` is 1.

5. **Final Result:** The `orthogonal_mp_gram` function then processes these outputs and returns the `coef` array. The final `coef` will have a value of 2.15579371 at index 4 and 0 elsewhere.
