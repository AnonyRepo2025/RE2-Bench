Let's trace the execution of `_eval_subs` with the given input.

1. **Initial Check:** The function first checks if `self` is the same as `old`. Since `self` and `old` are different, the code proceeds.

2. **_eval_subs:** The method `self._eval_subs(old, new)` is called.  According to the provided code, `Application.eval` always returns `None`. Therefore, `_eval_subs` also returns `None`.

3. **Fallback:** Since `_eval_subs` returned `None`, the `fallback` function is called.

4. **Inner Loop:** Inside `fallback`, the code iterates through `self.args`.  In this case, `self.args` is empty, so the loop does not execute.

5. **hit = False:** Because the loop never executes, the `hit` flag remains `False`.

6. **Return self:** Since `hit` is `False`, the function returns `self` unchanged.


Therefore, the output will be the original `self` object.
