Let's trace the execution of `factor_terms` with the given input.

1. **Input Processing:** The input expression `-(\"sqrt(21)\" + 5)**(1/3) + \"sqrt(3)\"*I*(\"sqrt(21)\" + 5)**(1/3)` is a string representation of a symbolic expression.  Sympy's `sympify` will convert this string into a SymPy expression. Let's represent sqrt(21) + 5 as 'x' for brevity. The expression becomes `-x**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*x**(1/3)`.

2. **`do` function:**
   - The expression is an instance of `Add`, so it's not an atom and has `args_cnc`.
   - The `as_content_primitive` method is called on the expression.
   - Inside `as_content_primitive`:
     - The content `cont` is 1, and the primitive `p` is the expression itself.
   - Since `p` is an `Add`, the code iterates through its arguments: `-x**(1/3)` and `sqrt(3)*I*x**(1/3)`.
   - `do` is called recursively on each argument.
   - For `-x**(1/3)`:
     - `as_content_primitive` returns (-1, x**(1/3)).
   - For `sqrt(3)*I*x**(1/3)`:
     - `as_content_primitive` returns (sqrt(3)*I, x**(1/3)).
   - The `special` dictionary remains empty.
   - `gcd_terms` is called on `Add(-x**(1/3), sqrt(3)*I*x**(1/3))`. This will likely simplify to `x**(1/3)*(-1 + sqrt(3)*I)`.
   - `_keep_coeff` is called with `cont=1` and the simplified expression.

3. **Final Result:** The final result will be the simplified expression, likely equivalent to `(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) * (-1 + sqrt(3)*I)`.
