1. **`check_X_y(X, y, 'csr', ensure_min_features=2, force_all_finite=False)`**: This function checks the compatibility of `X` and `y`. `force_all_finite=False` allows NaN and inf values in `X`.  It converts `X` and `y` to numpy arrays. Since `X` contains `nan` and `inf`, it will remain as a floating-point array.

2. **`check_cv(self.cv, y, is_classifier(self.estimator))`**: `self.cv` is 5, `is_classifier` will return True because the estimator is expected to have a `predict` method (not shown in the provided code but implied by the context of feature selection).  Since `y` consists of three distinct classes (0, 1, and 2), `type_of_target(y)` will return 'multiclass'. Thus, `check_cv` returns a `StratifiedKFold` object with 5 splits.

3. **`check_scoring(self.estimator, scoring=self.scoring)`**: `self.scoring` is None.  Since RFECV inherits from RFE, and RFE has a default scoring method, this will return a default scorer from RFE's `score` method.

4. The code then calculates the step size based on `self.step` and `n_features`. In this case, `step` will be 1.

5. **Parallel loop**: The code performs a parallel loop over the cross-validation splits. In each iteration, `_rfe_single_fit` is called with a temporary `RFE` object, the estimator, data, and scorer.  This temporary RFE object starts with `min_features_to_select`.

6. **`scores = np.sum(scores, axis=0)`**: The scores from each fold are summed up.

7. **`n_features_to_select` calculation**: The code finds the index of the maximum score and calculates the optimal number of features to select.

8. **Final RFE fit**: A new `RFE` object is created with the calculated `n_features_to_select` and fitted to the entire dataset.

9. **`self.estimator_.fit(...)`**: The original estimator is cloned, and the cloned estimator is fitted with the transformed data (data with selected features).

10. **`self.grid_scores_`**: The cross-validation scores are stored.

The output will be the `self` object with updated attributes.  Specifically, `support_`, `n_features_`, `ranking_`, `estimator_`, and `grid_scores_` will have new values.  The exact values of these attributes depend on the behavior of the estimator and the data, which are not fully specified in the provided context.  However, we can predict the structure of the output.
