Let's trace the execution of the `to` method with the given inputs.

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - `other` is compared to `self.physical_unit`. They are the same object (meter unit).
   - The code enters the `if` block and returns `self.to_physical(value)`.

2. **`to_physical` Call:**
   - We don't have the implementation of `to_physical`, but based on the context, it likely converts the value from the function unit to the physical unit.
   - `self.function_unit` has a `_scale` of -2.0. This suggests a logarithmic relationship, possibly magnitude.  A common magnitude system is defined as -2.5 * log10(value). However, the provided code uses a scale of -2.0.
   - Let's assume `to_physical` calculates `10**(value / self.function_unit._scale)`.
   - In this case, `value` is 2.5 and `self.function_unit._scale` is -2.0.
   - So, the result would be 10**(2.5 / -2.0) = 10**(-1.25) â‰ˆ 0.056234

Therefore, the final result is approximately 0.056234.
