The provided code doesn't define `_build_repr`.  It's impossible to determine the output of `__repr__` without knowing the implementation of `_build_repr`.  It likely uses the `self` argument to construct a string representation of the object, but the exact format is unknown.  Therefore, I cannot provide a prediction for the output.

```
I cannot predict the output without the definition of _build_repr.
