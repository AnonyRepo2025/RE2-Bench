Let's trace the execution of `besselsimp` with the given input.

1. **Initial replacements:** The input expression contains `besseli` and `exp_polar(I*pi/2)`, which is in `ifactors`. Thus, the first replacement within `replacer` changes `besseli(a, 2*sqrt(x)*exp_polar(I*pi/2))` to `besselj(a, 2*sqrt(x)*exp_polar(I*pi/2))`. The expression becomes `exp(-I*pi*a/2)*besselj(a, 2*sqrt(x)*exp_polar(I*pi/2))`.

2. **Second replacement:** The expression now contains `besselj` and `exp_polar(I*pi/2)`. This matches the second replacement within `replacer`, converting the `besselj` back to `besseli`. The expression reverts to `exp(-I*pi*a/2)*besseli(a, 2*sqrt(x)*exp_polar(I*pi/2))`.

3. **Third replacement:** The expression contains `besseli` and `exp_polar(I*pi/2)`, but this time it's handled by the `torewrite` function within the second `replacer`. This rewrites `besseli(a, 2*sqrt(x)*exp_polar(I*pi/2))` to `besselj(a, 2*sqrt(x)*exp_polar(I*pi/2)).rewrite(besseli)`. This essentially cancels out, leaving the expression as `exp(-I*pi*a/2)*besseli(a, 2*sqrt(x)*exp_polar(I*pi/2))`.

4. **Fourth replacement:** No further replacements occur as the conditions for `minusfactors` and `expander` are not met.

5. **Final return:** The function returns the simplified expression, which is the same as the original input after the series of replacements and rewrites.
