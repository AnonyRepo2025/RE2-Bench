Let's trace the execution of `as_string` with the given input.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `items = {'replaces_str': '', 'initial_str': ''}`
   - `imports = set()`
   - `operations = []`

2. **Operations Loop:**
   - The `for` loop over `self.migration.operations` is skipped because `self.migration.operations` is `null`.

3. **Dependencies Loop:**
   - The `for` loop over `self.migration.dependencies` is skipped because it's implicitly empty (due to `operations` being `null`).

4. **Migration Imports:**
   - The loop checking for manual porting is skipped because `imports` is empty.
   - `'from django.db import migrations'` is added to `imports`.
   - `sorted_imports` becomes `['from django.db import migrations']`.
   - `items['imports'] = '\nfrom django.db import migrations\n'`

5. **Replaces String:**
   - The `if self.migration.replaces:` block is skipped because `self.migration.replaces` doesn't exist (implicitly `None`).

6. **Header:**
   - `items['migration_header'] = ''` because `self.include_header` is `false`.

7. **Initial String:**
   - The `if self.migration.initial:` block is skipped because `self.migration.initial` doesn't exist.

8. **Template Rendering:**
   - The `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE` is rendered with the collected `items`.

Therefore, the final output will be the `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE` with the placeholder values replaced by the computed values.

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
    ]

    operations = [
