[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of `polytope_integrate` with the given input.

1. **Input Processing:**
   - `poly` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
   - `expr` is the string "x**2 + x*y + y**2".
   - `clockwise` is `False` (default).
   - `max_degree` is `None` (default).

2. **Conditional Checks:**
   - The first `if` block regarding `clockwise` is skipped.
   - The next `if/elif/else` block checks the type and structure of `poly`. Since `poly` is an empty dictionary, none of these conditions are met, and we proceed to the last `else` block.
   - Inside the `else` block:
     - `vertices = poly[0]` raises a `KeyError` because the dictionary `poly` has no key `0`.

Therefore, the function will terminate with a `KeyError`.
