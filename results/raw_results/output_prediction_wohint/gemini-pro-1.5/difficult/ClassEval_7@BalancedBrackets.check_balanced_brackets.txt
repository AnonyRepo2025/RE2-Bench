Here's how `check_balanced_brackets` executes with the given input:

1. **`clear_expr()`:** The `expr` is already just brackets, so this function doesn't change it.  `self.expr` remains "[(){}".

2. **Loop:**
   - '[':  `stack` becomes `['[']`.
   - '(': `stack` becomes `['[', '(']`.
   - ')': `stack.pop()` returns '('. The if condition `Current_Brkt == '(' and Brkt != ')'` is false, so execution continues. `stack` becomes `['[']`.
   - '{': `stack` becomes `['[', '{']`.
   - '}': `stack.pop()` returns '{'. The if condition `Current_Brkt == '{' and Brkt != '}'` is false, so execution continues. `stack` becomes `['[']`.

3. **Final Check:** The loop finishes, and `self.stack` is `['[']`, which is not empty. Therefore, the function returns `False`.
