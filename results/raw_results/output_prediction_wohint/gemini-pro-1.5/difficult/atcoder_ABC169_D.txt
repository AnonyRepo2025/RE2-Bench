Let's trace the execution with input 32:

1. **x = int(input())**: x becomes 32.

2. **factorization(32)**:
   - The function finds the prime factorization of 32.
   - The loop runs from 2 to 5 (integer part of sqrt(32)).
   - i = 2: 32 % 2 == 0. cnt becomes 5, and temp becomes 1.
   - The loop terminates.
   - arr becomes [[2, 5]].

3. **l = sorted(l)**: l remains [[2, 5]].

4. **Loop for calculating ans**:
   - The loop iterates once (len(l) is 1).
   - l[0][0] is 2, not 1.
   - num becomes 5.
   - The inner loop runs:
     - j = 1: s = 1.
     - j = 2: s = 3.
     - j = 3: s = 6. Since s > num, j becomes 2.
   - ans becomes 2.

5. **print(ans)**: The code prints 2.
