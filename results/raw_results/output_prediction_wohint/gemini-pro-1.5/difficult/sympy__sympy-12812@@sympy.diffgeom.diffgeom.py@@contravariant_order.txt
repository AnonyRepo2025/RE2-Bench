The input `expr` is an empty dictionary `{}`.  Since it's not an instance of any of the explicitly handled types (`Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `BaseVectorField`, `TensorProduct`), the execution will fall into the `else` block at the end of the function.

Since `_strict` is False (default value), the condition `not _strict or expr.atoms(BaseScalarField)` will be evaluated. `not _strict` is True.  Therefore, the entire condition is True, and the function will return 0.
