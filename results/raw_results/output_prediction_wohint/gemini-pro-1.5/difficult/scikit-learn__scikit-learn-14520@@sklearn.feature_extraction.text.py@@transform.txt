1. The `transform` method first checks if `_tfidf` is fitted using `check_is_fitted`. Since `_tfidf` exists and has the required attributes, no error is raised.
2. It then calls `super().transform(raw_documents)`, which is `CountVectorizer.transform`.
3. Inside `CountVectorizer.transform`:
    - It checks if the vocabulary is fitted and not empty. Both conditions are met.
    - It calls `_count_vocab` with `fixed_vocab=True`.
4. Inside `_count_vocab`:
    - Since `fixed_vocab` is True, it uses the existing `vocabulary_`.
    - It initializes `j_indices`, `indptr`, and `values`.
    - Since `raw_documents` is None, the loop does not execute.
    - It creates a CSR matrix with shape (0, 11) because `len(indptr) - 1` is 0 and `len(vocabulary)` is 11.
5. The result of `super().transform` is the empty CSR matrix.
6. Finally, `transform` returns `self._tfidf.transform(X, copy=False)`, where `X` is the empty CSR matrix. This will effectively multiply the empty matrix by the `_idf_diag` matrix in `_tfidf`, resulting in another empty CSR matrix of the same shape.
