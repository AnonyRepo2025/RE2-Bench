Let's trace the execution of `_eval_evalf` with the given input.

1. **`self.func.__name__`**: This will retrieve the name of the function class. Let's assume it's something like "sin" for this example.

2. **`hasattr(mpmath, fname)`**: This checks if `mpmath` has a function with the given name (e.g., "sin").  We'll assume it does.

3. **`getattr(mpmath, fname)`**: This retrieves the `mpmath` function.

4. **`args = [arg._to_mpmath(prec + 5) for arg in self.args]`**: This converts the arguments of the function to `mpmath` numbers with a precision of `prec + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7`.  Since `self.args` contains only one element, let's assume this argument is a symbolic `x` with an assigned value.  The `_to_mpmath` function will be called on this argument.

5. **Inside `_to_mpmath`**:
    - It checks if the argument is an integer. Let's assume it's not.
    - It checks for `_as_mpf_val`. Let's assume it doesn't exist.
    - It calls `evalf(self, prec, {})`.

6. **Inside `evalf`**:
    - It checks `evalf_table` for a specialized function. Let's assume it's not found.
    - It calls `x._eval_evalf(prec)`. This is a recursive call to the original function. However, since we assumed the argument is a symbolic `x` with a value, this time the `_eval_evalf` will likely return a `Float` based on the assigned value. Let's assume this value is 0.5.
    - The `evalf` function then converts the result to `mpmath` format.

7. **Back in `_eval_evalf`**:
    - The `mpmath` function (e.g., `mpmath.sin`) is called with the converted argument.
    - The result is converted back to a SymPy `Float` using `Expr._from_mpmath`.

Since we assumed the function is "sin" and the argument is 0.5, the `mpmath.sin(0.5)` will be calculated with precision 7, and the result will be converted to a SymPy `Float`.
