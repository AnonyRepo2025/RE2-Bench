Let's trace the execution of the code with the given input 423.

The code constructs a list `li` by iterating from 1 to 370.

1. **i from 1 to 9:** `li` becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
2. **i from 10 to 99:** The digits of `i` are appended to `li` in reverse order. For example, when i=10, temp becomes [0, 1], and then li becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0].  This continues up to 99.
3. **i from 100 to 370:** Similar to the two-digit case, the digits are appended in reverse order. For example, when i=100, temp becomes [0, 0, 1], and li extends to include these digits.

After the loop, `li.pop()` is called twice, removing the last two elements added (which would be the digits of 370: 0, 7, and then 3).

Finally, the code reads an integer input `n` (which is 423 in this case) and prints `li[n-1]`, which is `li[422]`.

Now, let's calculate the length of the list `li` after the loop and before the pops:

- Single-digit numbers: 9 elements
- Two-digit numbers (10-99): 90 numbers * 2 digits/number = 180 elements
- Three-digit numbers (100-370): 271 numbers * 3 digits/number = 813 elements

Total elements before pops: 9 + 180 + 813 = 1002
After two pops: 1002 - 2 = 1000

Since the input `n` is 423, the code tries to access `li[422]`.

To determine the value at `li[422]`, we can break down the index as follows:

- First 9 elements are single digits (1-9).
- Next 180 elements are from two-digit numbers.
- The remaining elements are from three-digit numbers.

422 falls within the range of three-digit numbers.  Since we've covered 9 + 180 = 189 elements with single and two-digit numbers, the index within the three-digit range is 422 - 189 = 233.

Now, we need to find which three-digit number and which digit this index corresponds to.  Dividing 233 by 3 gives us 77 with a remainder of 2.  This means we are looking at the 78th three-digit number (since we start from 0), which is 100 + 77 = 177. The remainder of 2 indicates the third digit (counting from the right, starting at 0), which is 1.
