Let's trace the execution of `_sqlite_datetime_parse` with the given inputs.

1. **Initial values:**
   - `dt` = "2016-06-13 00:00:00"
   - `tzname` = "UTC"
   - `conn_tzname` = "UTC"

2. **typecast_timestamp(dt):**
   - The input string `dt` contains a space, so it's treated as a datetime.
   - `d` becomes "2016-06-13" and `t` becomes "00:00:00".
   - `dates` becomes ["2016", "06", "13"].
   - `times` becomes ["00", "00", "00"].
   - `seconds` becomes "00", and `microseconds` becomes "0".
   - Assuming `settings.USE_TZ` is True, `tzinfo` is set to `utc`.
   - The function returns a datetime object: `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)`

3. **conn_tzname check:**
   - `conn_tzname` is "UTC".
   - `dt` is updated to include the timezone information: `dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.timezone('UTC'))`. This doesn't change the actual time since the datetime object was already in UTC.

4. **tzname check:**
   - `tzname` is "UTC", which is equal to `conn_tzname`.
   - The `if` block is skipped.

5. **Return:**
   - The function returns the final `dt` value, which is `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.timezone('UTC'))`.
