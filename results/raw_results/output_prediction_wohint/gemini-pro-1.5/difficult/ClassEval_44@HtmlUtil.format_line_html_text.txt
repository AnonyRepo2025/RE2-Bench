[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of `format_line_html_text` with the given input.

1. **Initialization:** The `HtmlUtil` object is initialized with several marker attributes. These are not directly used in this specific call.

2. **`format_line_html_text` call:** The function receives `<ul><li>Item 1</li></ul>` as `html_text`.

3. **Soup Creation:** BeautifulSoup parses the HTML text.

4. **Code Tag Handling:** The code finds all `pre` and `blockquote` tags. Since there are none in the input, this part does nothing.

5. **UL/OL Group Handling:** The code finds all `ul` and `ol` tags.  There's one `ul` tag.
   - Inside the `ul`, it finds all `li` tags. There's one `li` tag with the text "Item 1".
   - `li_item_text` becomes "Item 1".
   - The last character of `li_item_text` is '1', which is not in `string.punctuation`.
   - The code modifies the `li` tag's string to `[-]Item 1.`.

6. **P Group Handling:** The code finds all `p` tags. Since there are none in the input, this part does nothing.

7. **Clean Text Extraction:** `soup.get_text()` extracts the text from the modified soup, which is now "[-]Item 1.".  `gensim.utils.decode_htmlentities` doesn't change this string as there are no HTML entities.

8. **Line Feed Formatting:** `__format_line_feed` replaces multiple newlines with single newlines. Since there are no newlines in the text, this part does nothing.

9. **Return:** The function returns "[-]Item 1.".
