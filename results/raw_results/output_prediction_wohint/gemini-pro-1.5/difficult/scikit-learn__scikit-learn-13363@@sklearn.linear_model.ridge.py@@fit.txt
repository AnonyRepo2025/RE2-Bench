1. **check_X_y**: The `check_X_y` function will validate `X` and `y`.
   - `X` will be converted to a NumPy array of float64 dtype.
   - `y` will be converted to a NumPy array of float64 dtype and reshaped to a column vector if necessary.
   - The function will check that `X` and `y` have consistent lengths.

2. **_preprocess_data**: This function will center `X` and `y` by subtracting their means. Since `normalize` is false, no scaling will be applied. `sample_weight` is a scalar, so it will be broadcasted to the same shape as `y`.

3. **_ridge_regression**: Since `X` is dense and `solver` is 'auto', the `_ridge_regression` function will use either 'cholesky', 'svd', 'lsqr', 'sparse_cg', 'sag', or 'saga' solver based on the input data and parameters. In this case, since `X` is dense and not large, it will likely use 'cholesky'. The function will compute the Ridge regression coefficients and number of iterations. Since `fit_intercept` is true, the intercept will be calculated and returned.

4. **_set_intercept**: Since `fit_intercept` is true, the intercept will be adjusted based on the offsets and scale of `X` and `y`.

5. **Return**: The `fit` method will return the modified `self` object with updated `coef_`, `n_iter_`, and `intercept_` attributes.
