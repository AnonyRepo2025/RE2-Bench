1. The input `query` is a list of lists, not a `MultiValueDict`.
2. The `if isinstance(query, MultiValueDict)` and `elif hasattr(query, 'items')` conditions are both false.
3. The code iterates through the `query` list:
   - For `['a', 1]`: `key` is 'a', `value` is 1. Since `doseq` is False (default), `query_val` becomes 1. `query_params` becomes `[('a', 1)]`.
   - For `['b', 2]`: `key` is 'b', `value` is 2. `query_val` becomes 2. `query_params` becomes `[('a', 1), ('b', 2)]`.
   - For `['c', 3]`: `key` is 'c', `value` is 3. `query_val` becomes 3. `query_params` becomes `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]`.
4. `original_urlencode(query_params, doseq)` is called with `doseq=False`. This encodes the list of tuples into a URL-encoded string.
