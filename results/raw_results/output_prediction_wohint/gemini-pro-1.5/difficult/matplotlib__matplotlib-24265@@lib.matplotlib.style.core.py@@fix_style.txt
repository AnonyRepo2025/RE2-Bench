Inside `fix_style(s)`:
1. `s` is a string, so the first conditional is met.
2. `s = style_alias.get(s, s)`. Since `s` is "default", and "default" is not a key in `style_alias`, `s` remains "default".
3. The next conditional `if s in _DEPRECATED_SEABORN_STYLES:` is not met, since `s` is "default".
4. The function returns `s`, which is "default".
