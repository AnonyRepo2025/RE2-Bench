1. **Initialization:**
   - `coeff` is initialized to 1.
   - `factors` is initialized to an empty list.

2. **Mul.make_args(expr):**
   - The expression `x + 4` is not a Mul, so `make_args` returns a tuple containing the sympified expression: `(x + 4,)`.

3. **Looping through args:**
   - The loop iterates only once, with `arg` being `x + 4`.

4. **Conditions within the loop:**
   - `arg.is_Number` is false.
   - `arg.is_Pow` is false.
   - Thus, `base` becomes `x + 4` and `exp` becomes 1.

5. **_poly_from_expr(base, opt):**
   - This function attempts to convert the expression `x + 4` into a polynomial.
   - It succeeds, creating a polynomial representation of `x + 4`.

6. **getattr(poly, method + '_list')():**
   - `method` is "factor", so this becomes `poly.factor_list()`.
   - The `factor_list` method of the polynomial object is called. For `x + 4`, which is irreducible over integers, it returns `(1, [(x + 4, 1)])`.

7. **Processing the result of factor_list:**
   - `_coeff` is 1.
   - `_factors` is `[(x + 4, 1)]`.
   - Since `_coeff` is 1, the `if _coeff is not S.One:` block is skipped.
   - Since `exp` is 1, `factors.extend(_factors)` is executed, making `factors = [(x + 4, 1)]`.

8. **Return:**
   - The function returns `(coeff, factors)`, which is `(1, [(x + 4, 1)])`.
