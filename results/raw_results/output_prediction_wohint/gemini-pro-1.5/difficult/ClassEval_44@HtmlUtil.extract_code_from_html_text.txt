Let's trace the execution of `extract_code_from_html_text` with the given input.

1. **`format_line_html_text(html_text)` is called:**
   - The HTML is parsed.
   - Code tags (`pre`, `blockquote`) are found and their content is replaced with `-CODE-`.
   - `<p>` tags' content is modified to end with a period.
   - The result of `format_line_html_text` will be:
     "Title.This is a paragraph.-CODE-Another paragraph.:-CODE-"

2. **Check for `CODE_MARK`:**
   - `-CODE-` is present in the formatted text.

3. **Extract code:**
   - The original HTML is parsed again.
   - Code tags (`pre`, `blockquote`) are found. There are two of them.
   - The content of the first `pre` tag is extracted: `print('Hello, world!')`
   - The content of the second `pre` tag is extracted: `<code>for i in range(4):\n                print(i)</code>`

4. **Return the list of code snippets:**
   - The function returns a list containing the extracted code snippets.

Therefore, the output will be a list containing the two code blocks.

[OUTPUT]
```json
{
    "output": [
        "print('Hello, world!')",
        "<code>for i in range(4):\n                print(i)</code>"
    ]
}
```
