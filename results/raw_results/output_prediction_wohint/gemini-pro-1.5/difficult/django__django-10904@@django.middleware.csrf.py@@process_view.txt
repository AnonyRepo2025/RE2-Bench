Let's trace the execution of `process_view` with the given input.

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - `request.csrf_processing_done` is False.
   - `callback.csrf_exempt` is False.
   - `request.method` is "POST", which is not in ('GET', 'HEAD', 'OPTIONS', 'TRACE').
   - `request._dont_enforce_csrf_checks` is False (default).

2. **Security Checks (because `request.method` is POST):**
   - `request.is_secure()` will likely return False (not specified in input). Thus the referer checks are skipped.
   - `csrf_token` is retrieved from `request.META['CSRF_COOKIE']` which is "ABC1bcdefghij2bcdefghij3bcdefghij4bcdefghij5bcdefghij6bcdefghijA".
   - `request_csrf_token` is initially empty. Since the method is POST:
     - It tries to get it from `request.POST.get('csrfmiddlewaretoken', '')`. This is empty in the input.
     - Then it tries `request.META.get(settings.CSRF_HEADER_NAME, '')`. This is also empty in the input.
   - `request_csrf_token` remains empty.
   - `_sanitize_token(request_csrf_token)` is called with an empty string. This will generate a new token.
   - `_compare_salted_tokens` compares the newly generated token with the original `csrf_token`. This will return `False`.
   - Since the comparison fails, `_reject` is called, and the function returns a rejection response.

Therefore, the output will be a rejection response. Since the question asks for the output of `process_view`, and the rejection path returns a response object, the `process_view` function itself returns that response object.
