1. The `__eq__` method of `Expr` is called.
2. Inside `__eq__`, `_sympify("picoweber")` is called.
3. `_sympify` calls `sympify("picoweber", strict=True)`.
4. `sympify` attempts to convert "picoweber" to a SymPy object. Since "picoweber" is not a recognized symbol or number, it raises a `SympifyError`.
5. The `__eq__` method catches the `SympifyError` and returns `False`.
