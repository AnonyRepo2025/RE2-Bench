1. **y_true and y_pred processing:** `y_true` and `y_pred` are converted to NumPy arrays.
2. **eps:** `eps` is set to `auto`, so it will be assigned the smallest representable positive number based on the data type of `y_pred`.
3. **LabelBinarizer:** A `LabelBinarizer` is created and fitted to `y_true`. This determines the unique classes in `y_true`, which are [0, 1].
4. **Transforming labels:** `y_true` is transformed into a one-hot encoded representation: `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.
5. **y_pred clipping:** `y_pred` values are clipped to be within the range [eps, 1-eps].
6. **y_pred reshaping:** Since `y_pred` is 1D, it's reshaped to 2D: `[[0], [1]]`. Then, as it has only one column, it's expanded to `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.
7. **y_pred normalization:** The sum of `y_pred` rows is checked to be close to 1. If not, a warning is issued, and `y_pred` is normalized so that each row sums to 1. In this case, y_pred is already normalized.
8. **Loss calculation:** The log loss is calculated using the formula `-xlogy(transformed_labels, y_pred)`.
9. **Weighted sum:** The losses are summed up. Since `sample_weight` is None, and `normalize` is True, the sum is divided by the number of samples (2).

Therefore, the final result will be a very small value close to 0, due to the clipping of `y_pred` and the nature of the log loss function.
