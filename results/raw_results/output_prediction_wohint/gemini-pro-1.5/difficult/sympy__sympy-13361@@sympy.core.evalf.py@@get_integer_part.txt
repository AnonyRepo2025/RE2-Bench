1. **evalf(expr, assumed_size, options):** `expr` is 1/2, `assumed_size` is 30, and `options` is an empty dictionary. `evalf` returns (mpf('0.5'), None, 30, None).
2. **gap calculation:** Since only `ire` is present, `gap` becomes `fastlog(0.5) - 30`, which is approximately `-30.69`.
3. **Re-evaluation of evalf:** Since `gap` < -10, `evalf` is called again with higher precision: `evalf(expr, 10 + 30 + (-30.69), options)`. This simplifies to `evalf(expr, 9.31, options)`, which will likely return a similar result as before, but with a lower precision (around 9). Let's assume it returns (mpf('0.5'), None, 9, None).
4. **calc_part(re(expr), ire):**
   - `nint = int(to_int(ire, rnd)) = int(0.5) = 0`
   - `is_int = False` because the precision of `ire` is not 0.
   - `expr = Add(expr, -nint, evaluate=False) = 1/2 - 0 = 1/2`
   - `evalf(expr, 10, options)` is called, returning (mpf('0.5'), None, 10, None).
   - `check_target` is called and passes.
   - `nint += int(no * (mpf_cmp(x, fzero) == no)) = 0 + int(-1 * (1 == -1)) = 0`.
   - `nint` is returned as 0.
5. **Return values:** Since `return_ints` is True, the function returns `(int(re_), int(im_)) = (0, 0)`.
