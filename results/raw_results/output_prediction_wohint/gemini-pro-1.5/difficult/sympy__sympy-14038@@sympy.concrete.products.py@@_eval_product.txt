Here's how `_eval_product` will execute with the given input:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `term` is the expression `2**(2*f(k))`.
   - `limits` is a list containing only '1'. This isn't a valid limit tuple (should be (k, a, n)). The function expects `limits` to be a tuple of three elements: the index variable, the lower limit, and the upper limit.

2. **Limit Check:**
   - The code checks if `k` is present in `term.free_symbols`.  `k` *is* present in the term (inside the function `f(k)`).

3. **Incomplete Limits:**
   - Since the `limits` argument doesn't have the required three elements (k, a, n), none of the conditional checks within the function will be met.

4. **No Calculation, Return None:**
   - The function will fall through all the `if/elif` conditions without finding a matching case.  Therefore, it will implicitly return `None`.
