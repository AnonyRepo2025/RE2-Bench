[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of `exptrigsimp` with the given input "(1 + exp(2))/(y*(-1 + exp(2)))".

1. **Initial Simplification:** The `bottom_up` function with `exp_trig` attempts to rewrite the expression in terms of exponentials or trigonometric functions, choosing the form with the fewest operations. In this case, the expression already contains `exp`, and rewriting it in terms of `cos` or other forms doesn't simplify it further. So, the expression remains unchanged after this step.

2. **Hyperbolic/Trigonometric Simplification:** The code then checks for hyperbolic functions and rewrites them in terms of trigonometric functions if present.  Since there are no hyperbolic functions, this part is skipped. Similarly, the subsequent check for trigonometric functions and application of `TR2i` is also skipped.

3. **Main Simplification Loop:** The core logic lies within the second `bottom_up` call with function `f`. This function attempts to identify patterns involving exponentials and rewrite them using hyperbolic or trigonometric functions.

   - The expression is parsed as a multiplication of terms.
   - The code looks for patterns like `exp(x)` and `1 + exp(x)` or `1 - exp(x)`.
   - In our case, the expression can be rewritten as:

     ```
     (1 + exp(2)) / (y * (-1 + exp(2))) = (1 + exp(2)) / (y * (exp(2) - 1))
     ```

   - The code doesn't find direct matches for the patterns it's looking for (like `1 + exp(x)` in the numerator and `1 - exp(x)` in the denominator to rewrite as `-coth(x/2)`).  Therefore, the `f` function doesn't modify the expression.

4. **Final Check and Return:** The code checks if the simplified expression contains `I` (imaginary unit) while the original expression didn't. Since this is not the case, the function returns the expression obtained after the initial simplification, which is the same as the input.

Therefore, the final output will be the same as the input expression.
