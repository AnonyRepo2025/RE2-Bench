Here's how we determine the output of `check_winner`:

1. **Calculate player hand value:**
   - 2S (2) + 4S (4) + 5S (5) = 11

2. **Calculate dealer hand value:**
   - 2S (2) + JS (10) + QS (10) = 22

3. **Check winner:**
   - Player hand value (11) is less than 21.
   - Dealer hand value (22) is greater than 21.
   - Therefore, the player wins.
