Here's how `doit(p, q)` will execute with the given inputs:

1. **Initial State:**
   - p = "zoo"
   - q = "0"

2. **Type Conversions:**
   - Inside `doit`, both `p` and `q` are implicitly converted to SymPy objects by the `eval` method.  "zoo" becomes a Symbol and "0" becomes an Integer.

3. **Conditions:**
   - `p.is_infinite`, `q.is_infinite`, `p is nan`, `q is nan`: These conditions are all false.
   - `p == q`, `p == -q`: These are false.
   - `p.is_Pow and ...`: This complex condition is false because `p` is not a `Pow` object.
   - `p.is_integer and q == 1`: False because `q` is 0.
   - `q.is_Number`: True.
   - `p.is_Number`: False.
   - `q == 2`: False.

4. **Division and Integer Check:**
   - `r = p / q`: This results in a `zoo/0`, which is a division by zero. However, SymPy generally doesn't raise exceptions for symbolic calculations. Instead, it represents this as `zoo*oo`.
   - The `try...except` block attempts to convert `r` to an integer. This will fail because `zoo*oo` is not an integer, so the `TypeError` is caught.

5. **No Early Return:** Since none of the conditions were met, and the integer conversion failed, the function continues.

6. **Return p:**
   - `d = p - q`: This results in `zoo - 0`, which simplifies to `zoo`.
   - `d.is_negative`: This is `None` because we don't know if `zoo` is positive or negative.
   - Since the first condition in the nested `if` is not met, the code proceeds to the `elif q.is_positive`: This is true.
   - Therefore, the function returns `p`, which is the symbol `zoo`.
