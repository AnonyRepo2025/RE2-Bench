Let's trace the execution of `_matrix_derivative` with the given input.

1. **`_matrix_derivative(expr, x)`**:
   - `expr` is an ImmutableDenseMatrix with shape (2, 2).
   - `x` is the symbol 'x'.

2. **`expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)`**: This calls `_eval_derivative` on `expr`.

3. **`expr._eval_derivative(x)`**: This calls `applyfunc(lambda x: x.diff(arg))`.

4. **`expr.applyfunc(lambda x: x.diff(x))`**: This applies the derivative with respect to `x` to each element of the matrix `expr`. Since `_mat` is null, it means the matrix elements are not explicitly defined.  However, the `applyfunc` will create a new matrix of the same dimensions (2x2) where each element is the derivative of the corresponding element in the original matrix with respect to x. Since the original matrix elements are not defined, their derivatives with respect to x will also be undefined but represented symbolically.

5. **Back in `_matrix_derivative`**:
   - `parts` becomes a list containing the result of `expr._eval_derivative(x)`, which is a 2x2 matrix of derivatives.
   - The code then attempts to convert the elements of `parts` to matrices using `convert_array_to_matrix`. Since the derivatives are symbolic, they will remain symbolic after this conversion.
   - The code calculates the rank of the resulting expression. In this case, the rank will be 2 because the derivative of a matrix with respect to a scalar is a matrix of the same dimensions.
   - Since the rank is 2, the code will attempt to construct the derivative using matrix multiplication and addition. The result will be a 2x2 matrix where each element is the derivative of the corresponding element in the original matrix with respect to x.

Therefore, the final result will be a 2x2 matrix of derivatives.
