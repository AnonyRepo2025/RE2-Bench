Let's trace the execution of `_eval_Eq` with the given empty dictionaries for `self` and `other`.

1. **`isinstance(other, MatrixExpr)`:** Since `other` is an empty dictionary, it's not an instance of `MatrixExpr`. This condition evaluates to `False`.

2. **Return `False`:**  The function immediately returns `False` because the first condition is not met.

Therefore, the final output is `False`.
