The `check_winner` function iterates through the board and checks for five consecutive identical symbols in all four directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and anti-diagonal).

1. **First Row:** The first row has five 'O's in a row. Starting from the first 'O' at (0, 0), the horizontal check will find a winner. The function will return 'O'.

The rest of the board doesn't need to be checked since a winner is found.
