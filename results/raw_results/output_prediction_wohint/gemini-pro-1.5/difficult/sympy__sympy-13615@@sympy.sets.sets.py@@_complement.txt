1. The `_complement` method is called with `self` being an instance of a `Set` (specifically, an `EmptySet` since `self` is empty) and `other` being a `FiniteSet` with elements 10 and 15.

2. The code enters the `elif isinstance(other, FiniteSet):` block.

3. Inside this block:
    - `ternary_sift` is defined. This function checks if an element is contained in `self`. Since `self` is an `EmptySet`, `self.contains(el)` will always return `False`.
    - `sifted = sift(other, ternary_sift)` sifts the elements of `other` based on the output of `ternary_sift`. Since `ternary_sift` always returns `False`, all elements of `other` will be in `sifted[False]`. `sifted[None]` will be empty.
    - The code then returns `Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet)`.
    - Since `sifted[None]` is empty, the `if sifted[None]` condition is false, and the `else` part is executed, returning `S.EmptySet`.

Therefore, the final result is an `EmptySet`.
