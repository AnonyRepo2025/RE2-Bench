1. **Copy and default setup:** The method starts by creating a copy of the `Scale` object and initializes `_tick_params` and `_label_params` if they are `None`.

2. **Transformation setup:** The `_get_transform()` method will be called. Since `trans="log"`, it will return a log transform function and its inverse.

3. **Matplotlib scale creation:** `_get_scale` is called with the data name ("ymax"), the forward log transform, and its inverse. This creates a `matplotlib.scale.LogScale` object.

4. **Axis handling:** Since `axis` is not provided, a `PseudoAxis` is created using the Matplotlib scale. The units of the axis are updated based on the provided data. Default locators and formatters are set on the Matplotlib scale.

5. **Normalization:** Since `prop.normed` is not provided (and thus implicitly `False`), the `normalize` function, `vmin`, and `vmax` are set to `None`.

6. **Pipeline creation:** A pipeline of functions is created. This pipeline will be used to transform data values. In this case, it consists of:
    - `axis.convert_units`: Converts data units to axis units.
    - `forward`: The log transform function.
    - `normalize`: `None` in this case.
    - `prop.get_mapping(new, data)`: Gets the appropriate mapping function based on the property and data. Since the property is "y", it will likely return a linear mapping function.

7. **Spacer calculation:** A `spacer` function is defined. This function calculates the minimum difference between unique, non-missing values in a series. It's used for determining tick spacing.

8. **Legend handling:** Since `prop.legend` is not provided (and thus implicitly `False`), the legend-related part of the code is skipped.

Therefore, the output will be a new `Scale` object (a copy of `self`) with updated attributes: `_tick_params`, `_label_params`, `_matplotlib_scale`, `_pipeline`, and `_spacer`. `_legend` remains `None`.
