Let's trace the execution of `factor_terms` with the given input "R3 + R4 + 4050".

1. **sympify("R3 + R4 + 4050")**: This converts the input string into a SymPy expression. Assuming R3 and R4 are symbols, the expression becomes `Add(Symbol('R3'), Symbol('R4'), Integer(4050))`.

2. **do(expr)**:
   - The expression is an `Add` instance, so it goes into the `if p.is_Add` block.
   - `list_args` becomes `[Symbol('R3'), Symbol('R4'), Integer(4050)]`.
   - The `all` condition checks if all terms can be multiplied by -1. This is false because 4050 cannot be factored by -1 to remain a positive integer.
   - `special` remains empty.
   - `p` remains `Add(Symbol('R3'), Symbol('R4'), Integer(4050))`.
   - `gcd_terms(p, isprimitive=True, clear=clear, fraction=fraction)` is called. Since there are no common factors between R3, R4, and 4050, this returns the original expression `Add(Symbol('R3'), Symbol('R4'), Integer(4050))`.
   - `rv = _keep_coeff(cont, p, clear=clear, sign=sign)` is called with `cont=1` and `p=Add(Symbol('R3'), Symbol('R4'), Integer(4050))`. This simply returns the expression unchanged.

Therefore, the final output is the same as the sympified input.
