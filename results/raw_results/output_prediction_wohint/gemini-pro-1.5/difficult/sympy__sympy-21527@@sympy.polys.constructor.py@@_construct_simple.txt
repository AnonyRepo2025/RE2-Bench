Let's trace the execution of `_construct_simple` with the given input.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `rationals`, `floats`, `complexes`, `algebraics` are initialized to `False`.
   - `float_numbers` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **Loop:**
   - The loop `for coeff in coeffs` will not execute as `coeffs` is `null`.

3. **Post Loop:**
   - `max_prec` will be 53 as `float_numbers` is empty.
   - The `if algebraics` block will not execute as `algebraics` is `False`.
   - Inside the `else` block:
     - None of the `if/elif` conditions will be met.
     - The `else` block within this `else` will execute:
       - `domain` will be set to `ZZ` as `complexes` is `False`.
       - `result` will be an empty list as `coeffs` is `null`.

4. **Return:**
   - The function will return the tuple `(domain, result)`, which is `(ZZ, [])`.


[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "domain": "ZZ",
    "result": []
}
```
