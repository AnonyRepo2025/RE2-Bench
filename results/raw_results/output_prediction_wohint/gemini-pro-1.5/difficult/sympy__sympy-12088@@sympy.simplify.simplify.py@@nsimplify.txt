The input expression `1/4 + "sqrt(5)\"/4` involves a string `"sqrt(5)"`.  `sympify` will handle this correctly, interpreting it as the square root of 5. The function will attempt to find a rational approximation but will fail because sqrt(5) is irrational.  Since no `tolerance` is provided, the default tolerance will be used.  Since no `rational` argument is provided, the function will return the simplified symbolic expression.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "result": "(1 + sqrt(5))/4"
}
