Here's how the `answer` function will execute with the given input:

1. **Input Check:** The input expression is "1+1+1+2".
2. **Statistic Calculation:** The code iterates through the expression and counts the occurrences of each digit:
   - '1': 3
   - '2': 1
3. **Number Usage Check:** It checks if the counts in `statistic` match the numbers available in `self.nums`:
   - `self.nums` contains four 1s. The expression uses three 1s.
   - `self.nums` does *not* contain a 2.
4. **Return False:** Because the expression uses a '2' which is not in `self.nums`, the function will immediately return `False`. It doesn't even proceed to evaluate the expression.
