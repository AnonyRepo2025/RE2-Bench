Let's trace the execution of the `__add__` method of the `Media` class given the provided input.

1. **Initialization of `self`:**
   - The input shows that `self._css_lists` and `self._js_lists` are initially `null`. However, the `__init__` method of the `Media` class initializes these attributes even if they are not provided in the constructor.  Since `media` is None, and both `css` and `js` are None (default), the `__init__` method sets `self._css_lists` to `[{}]` and `self._js_lists` to `[[]]`.

2. **Initialization of `other`:**
   - Similarly, the input `other` also has `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` as `null`. However, due to the same logic in the `__init__` method, `other._css_lists` will be `[{}]` and `other._js_lists` will be `[[]]`.

3. **Inside `__add__`:**
   - A new `Media` object, `combined`, is created.
   - `combined._css_lists` is initialized as a copy of `self._css_lists`, which is `[{}]`.
   - `combined._js_lists` is initialized as a copy of `self._js_lists`, which is `[[]]`.
   - The code then iterates through `other._css_lists`. Since `other._css_lists` is `[{}]`, the loop runs once.
   - The condition `item and item not in self._css_lists` checks if `item` is not empty and not already present in `self._css_lists`. In this case, `item` is `{}`. Since `{}` is present in `self._css_lists`, the condition is false, and `{}` is not appended again.
   - Similarly, the code iterates through `other._js_lists` which is `[[]]`. The loop runs once with `item` being `[]`. Since `[]` is present in `self._js_lists`, the condition is false, and `[]` is not appended again.

4. **Return value:**
   - The function returns the `combined` object.  `combined._css_lists` is `[{}]` and `combined._js_lists` is `[[]]`.

Therefore, the output will be a `Media` object with `_css_lists` as `[{}]` and `_js_lists` as `[[]]`.
