1. **Input Processing:** The function receives `X` (3 samples, 8 features), `dictionary` (8 atoms, 8 features), `gram` (8x8 precomputed Gram matrix), and other parameters. `algorithm` is "lasso_cd", `regularization` is 1.0, and `positive` is True.

2. **Algorithm Selection:** The code enters the `elif algorithm == 'lasso_cd'` block.

3. **Lasso with Coordinate Descent:** A `Lasso` object `clf` is created with the specified parameters.  `alpha` is calculated as `regularization / n_features = 1.0 / 8 = 0.125`. `positive=True` enforces non-negative coefficients.

4. **Lasso Fit:** `clf.fit(dictionary.T, X.T)` is called. This fits the Lasso model to the data, where `dictionary.T` becomes the design matrix (8 features, 8 samples) and `X.T` becomes the target (8 features, 3 samples). The coordinate descent algorithm is used for optimization, subject to the L1 penalty and the positivity constraint.

5. **Coefficient Extraction:** `new_code = clf.coef_` retrieves the learned coefficients. The shape of `new_code` will be (3, 8), representing the code for each of the 3 samples in terms of the 8 dictionary atoms.

6. **Return:** The function returns `new_code`.

Since the actual fitting process of Lasso is complex and iterative, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the coefficients without running the code. However, we can predict the shape and some properties of the output.
