The provided code snippet and input are for the `get_many` method of Django's `BaseCache` class.  Let's trace the execution based on the input:

1. **`get_many(self, keys, version=None)`:** The input shows `keys` is `null` and `version` is 2.  Since `keys` is null, the loop `for k in keys:` will not execute.

2. **Empty Dictionary:** The function initializes an empty dictionary `d = {}`.

3. **No Loop Execution:** Because `keys` is null, the loop never runs, and no items are added to the dictionary `d`.

4. **Return Empty Dictionary:** The function returns the dictionary `d`, which remains empty.


Therefore, the output will be an empty dictionary.
