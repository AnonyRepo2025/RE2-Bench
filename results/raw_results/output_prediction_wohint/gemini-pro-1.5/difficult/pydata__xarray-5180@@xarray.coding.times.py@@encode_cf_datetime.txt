1. **dates** is converted to a NumPy array. Its dtype is initially `datetime64[ns]`.
2. **units** is cleaned up by `_cleanup_netcdf_time_units`. `_unpack_netcdf_time_units` extracts "days" and "2000-01-01". `format_timestamp` converts the reference date to a string, so units becomes "days since 2000-01-01".
3. **calendar** remains "gregorian".
4. The code enters the `try` block because "gregorian" is a standard calendar.
5. Inside the `try` block:
    - `delta_units` becomes "D".
    - `time_delta` becomes `np.timedelta64(1, 'D')`.
    - `ref_date` becomes `pd.Timestamp('2000-01-01')`.
    - `dates_as_index` becomes `pd.DatetimeIndex(['2000-01-11T00:00:00.000000000'])`.
    - `time_deltas` becomes a `TimedeltaIndex` representing the difference between the input date and the reference date, which is 10 days.
    - The condition `np.all(time_deltas % time_delta == np.timedelta64(0, 'ns'))` is true, so `num` becomes 10.0.
6. `cast_to_int_if_safe` converts `num` to the integer 10.
7. The function returns the tuple `(10, "days since 2000-01-01", "gregorian")`.
