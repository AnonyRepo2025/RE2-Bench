1. **_check_targets**: `y_true` and `y_pred` are both 1D arrays of integers. The `type_of_target` for both is 'multiclass'. The function returns ('multiclass', y_true, y_pred).

2. **unique_labels**: Since `labels` is None, it calculates the unique labels from `y_true` and `y_pred`. The unique labels are [0, 1, 2].

3. **label_to_ind**: This dictionary maps labels to indices: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}.

4. **y_true and y_pred conversion**: Both `y_true` and `y_pred` are converted to numpy arrays using the `label_to_ind` mapping. Since all labels are present in the dictionary, the arrays remain the same.

5. **Filtering**: The `ind` variable becomes an array of all True values because all predicted and true labels are less than `n_labels` (which is 3). Therefore, `y_true`, `y_pred`, and `sample_weight` remain unchanged after filtering.

6. **coo_matrix creation**: A sparse matrix is created with the shape (3, 3). The values are the sample weights (all ones), and the coordinates are determined by `y_true` and `y_pred`.

7. **Conversion to dense array**: The sparse matrix is converted to a dense numpy array.

8. **Normalization**: Since `normalize` is None, no normalization is performed.

9. **Return**: The function returns the confusion matrix `cm`.

Let's calculate the confusion matrix:

```
   Predicted
     0  1  2
True
0   30 10  0
1    6 44  0
2    0  0  4
```

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "confusion_matrix": [
        [30, 10, 0],
        [6, 44, 0],
        [0, 0, 4]
    ]
}
```
