1. The `urlencode` function checks if the input `query` is a `MultiValueDict`. It's not in this case, so it moves to the next check.
2. It checks if `query` has an `items` attribute. It doesn't, so it proceeds to the loop.
3. The loop iterates through the `query` list of lists:
   - For `['a', 1]`: `key` is 'a', `value` is 1. Since `value` is not a sequence and `doseq` is False, `query_val` becomes 1. The tuple `('a', 1)` is appended to `query_params`.
   - For `['b', 2]`: `key` is 'b', `value` is 2. Similarly, `query_val` becomes 2, and `('b', 2)` is appended to `query_params`.
   - For `['c', 3]`: `key` is 'c', `value` is 3. Similarly, `query_val` becomes 3, and `('c', 3)` is appended to `query_params`.
4. Finally, `original_urlencode` is called with `query_params` which is `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]` and `doseq=False`. This will produce the URL-encoded string.
