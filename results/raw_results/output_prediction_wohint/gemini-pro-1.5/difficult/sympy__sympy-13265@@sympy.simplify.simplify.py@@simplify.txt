Let's trace the execution of the `simplify` function with the given input.

1. **Input Processing:**
   - The input `expr` is "50", which is a string.

2. **sympify(expr):**
   - The `sympify` function converts the string "50" into a SymPy Integer object.

3. **isinstance checks and simplification logic:**
   - The code checks if the sympified expression is an instance of various SymPy classes (Add, Mul, Pow, ExpBase). Since 50 is an Integer, none of these conditions are met.
   - The code then proceeds to the base case where it returns the input if it's not an instance of these classes and doesn't have any arguments (which is true for the Integer 50).

Therefore, the function returns the SymPy Integer object representing 50.

```
{
    "result": 50
