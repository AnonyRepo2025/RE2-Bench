The input represents an empty tuple. Let's trace the execution of `unparse` with the given input.

1. The input `node` is of type `Tuple` and `node.elts` is `null`.
2. The `if node.elts:` condition in the `Tuple` handling block will evaluate to `False`.
3. The `else` block will be executed, returning "()".
