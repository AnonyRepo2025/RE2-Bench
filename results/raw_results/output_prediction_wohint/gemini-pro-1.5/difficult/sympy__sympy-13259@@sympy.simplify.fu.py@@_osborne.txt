[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of `_osborne` with the given input.

1. **Input:** `e = 2*sinh(2)`, `d` is not provided, so it defaults to 1.

2. **Inside `_osborne`:**
   - The function `f(rv)` is defined. This function checks if `rv` is a hyperbolic function.

3. **`bottom_up(e, f)` is called:**
   - `bottom_up` traverses the expression tree from bottom to top, applying the function `f` to each node.

4. **`f(sinh(2))` is called:**
   - `rv` is `sinh(2)`.
   - `rv` is a `HyperbolicFunction`.
   - `a = rv.args[0] = 2`
   - `a = a * d = 2 * 1 = 2`
   - Since `rv.func` is `sinh`, the function returns `I * sin(a) = I * sin(2)`

5. **`f(2 * (I*sin(2)))` is called:**
   - `rv` is now `2 * (I*sin(2))` which resulted from the previous step.
   - `rv` is *not* a `HyperbolicFunction`.
   - The function returns `rv` unchanged, which is `2*I*sin(2)`.

Therefore, the final result is `2*I*sin(2)`.
