Let's trace the execution of `sympify` with the given input.

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - `a` is "{2.0, 3}".
   - `is_sympy` checks are negative.
   - No registered converter for `str` type.
   - No superclass converter found.
   - `a` is not a `CantSympify` instance.
   - `evaluate` defaults to `global_parameters.evaluate` (we'll assume it's True for simplicity, though its actual value doesn't affect this specific case much).
   - `_is_numpy_instance(a)` is False.
   - `a` doesn't have a `_sympy_` method.
   - Strict mode is False (default).
   - `a` doesn't have a `flat` attribute.
   - `a` is a string, so the numeric coercion block is skipped.

2. **String Handling:**
   - The code enters the string handling block.
   - `a` is not modified by newline removal (already no newlines).

3. **Parsing:**
   - `parse_expr` is called on "{2.0, 3}".
   - `parse_expr` attempts to parse this as a SymPy expression.
   - This will raise a `SympifyError` because "{2.0, 3}" is not valid SymPy syntax.  It looks more like a set literal, but the decimal makes it invalid.

4. **Exception Handling:**
   - The `SympifyError` is caught.

5. **Final Result:**
   - The function raises a `SympifyError`.

```
{
    "error": "SympifyError",
    "message": "could not parse '{2.0, 3}'"
