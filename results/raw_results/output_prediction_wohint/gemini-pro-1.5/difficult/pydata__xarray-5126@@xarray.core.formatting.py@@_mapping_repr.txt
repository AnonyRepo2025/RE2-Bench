Let's trace the execution of `_mapping_repr` with the given inputs.

1. **Initial setup:**
   - `col_width` is calculated using `_calculate_col_width`. The input to this function is the keys of the `mapping`, which is `["foo"]`. The maximum length of the strings in this list is 3. So, `col_width` becomes `max(3, 7) + 6 = 13`.
   - `max_rows` is set to `OPTIONS['display_max_rows']`. We don't have the value of this option, but it won't affect the output in this case because the mapping has only one element.
   - `summary` is initialized as `["Attributes:"]`.

2. **Mapping is not empty:**
   - The code enters the `if mapping:` block.
   - `len_mapping` is 1.
   - `_get_boolean_with_default("display_expand_attrs", default=True)` is called. Assuming the global option is not set (i.e., it's 'default'), this returns `True`.
   - Since `len_mapping` (1) is not greater than `max_rows` (we assume it's a reasonably large number like 10), the code enters the `else` block within the `if len_mapping > max_rows` condition.
   - The code iterates through the `mapping.items()`, which is `[("foo", "bar")]`.
   - The `summarizer` function is called with `k="foo"`, `v="bar"`, and `col_width=13`. We don't have the implementation of `summarizer` (it's `summarize_attr` in the original code), but we can infer its behavior based on the context. It likely formats the key-value pair with the given column width. Let's assume it returns `"    foo: bar     "` (padding with spaces to reach the column width).
   - This result is appended to the `summary` list.

3. **Final output:**
   - The `'\n'.join(summary)` is returned.

Therefore, the predicted output is:

[OUTPUT]
```
Attributes:
    foo: bar     
```
[/OUTPUT]
