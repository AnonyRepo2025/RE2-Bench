1. The input `data` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
2. The function checks if `data` is a string, bytes, has a `read` attribute, or is iterable. It is iterable (a dictionary).
3. The `to_key_val_list` function is called with the empty dictionary.
4. Inside `to_key_val_list`, since the input is a mapping, `value.items()` is returned, which is an empty list for an empty dictionary.
5. Back in `_encode_params`, the result of `to_key_val_list` is an empty list.
6. The `urlencode` function is called with an empty list, which returns an empty string.
