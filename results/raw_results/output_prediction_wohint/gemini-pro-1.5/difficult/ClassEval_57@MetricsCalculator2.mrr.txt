[THOUGHT]
Let's trace the execution of the `mrr` function with the given input.

The input `data` is a list containing a single tuple: `([0, 0, 0, 1], 4)`.

Since `data` is a list, the code enters the `if type(data) == list:` block.
The loop iterates only once with `sub_list = [0, 0, 0, 1]` and `total_num = 4`.

Inside the loop:
- `sub_list` becomes `np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])`.
- `total_num` is 4, so the `if total_num == 0:` block is skipped.
- `ranking_array` becomes `1.0 / (np.array([0, 1, 2, 3]) + 1)` which is `np.array([1.0, 0.5, 0.333..., 0.25])`.
- `mr_np` becomes element-wise product of `sub_list` and `ranking_array`: `np.array([0, 0, 0, 0.25])`.
- The loop `for team in mr_np:` starts.
- In the first iteration, `team` is 0. The `if team > 0:` condition is false.
- In the second iteration, `team` is 0. The `if team > 0:` condition is false.
- In the third iteration, `team` is 0. The `if team > 0:` condition is false.
- In the fourth iteration, `team` is 0.25. The `if team > 0:` condition is true.
- `mr` is assigned the value 0.25.
- The loop breaks.

- `separate_result.append(mr)` adds 0.25 to the initially empty list `separate_result`.

Finally, the function returns `(np.mean(separate_result), separate_result)`. Since `separate_result` contains only 0.25, the mean is also 0.25.

Therefore, the output is (0.25, [0.25]).
