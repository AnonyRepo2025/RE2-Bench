Let's trace the execution of `is_valid_move` with the given inputs.

1. **Initial checks:**
   - `pos1 = (0, 0)` and `pos2 = (0, 1)` are within the board boundaries.
   - `pos1 != pos2`
   - `board[0][0] == 'a'` and `board[0][1] == 'b'`. Thus, `board[pos1] != board[pos2]`.

2. **Return False:** Since the icons at `pos1` and `pos2` are different, the function immediately returns `False` without even checking for a path.
