1. Inside `variable_type`, the input vector is a pandas Series.
2. The Series is empty, so `pd.isna(vector).all()` returns True.
3. Since the Series is empty, `vector.dropna()` also returns an empty Series.
4. `bool(np.isin(vector, [0, 1]).all())` returns True, so the Series is a boolean vector.
5. Therefore, the output is `VarType('boolean')`.
