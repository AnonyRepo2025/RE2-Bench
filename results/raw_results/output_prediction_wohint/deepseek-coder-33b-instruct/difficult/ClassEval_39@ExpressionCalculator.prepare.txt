1. The `prepare` method is used to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression.
2. The `postfix_stack` is an empty deque.
3. The `operat_priority` is a list of operator priorities.
4. The `expression` is "2+3+4".
5. The `is_operator` method checks if a character is an operator.
6. The `compare` method compares the priority of two operators.
7. The `prepare` method iterates over the characters in the expression.
8. If the character is an operator, it checks the top of the operator stack.
9. If the top of the operator stack has higher or equal priority, it pops the operator from the stack and appends it to the postfix stack.
10. If the character is not an operator, it appends the number to the postfix stack.
11. After the iteration, it pops the remaining operators from the operator stack and appends them to the postfix stack.
12. The postfix stack will be "2", "3", "+", "4", "+".
