1. __init__(n=15) stores self.n = 15.
2. generate_primes() is called.
3. It initializes a boolean array "sieve" of size n+1 and sets all entries as true. 0 and 1 are not prime, so sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False.
4. It starts from the first prime number, 2, and marks its multiples as False.
5. It continues this process for all numbers up to sqrt(n).
6. It then collects all the prime numbers from the sieve, which are the indices of the True values.
7. So, the primes up to 15 are [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13].
