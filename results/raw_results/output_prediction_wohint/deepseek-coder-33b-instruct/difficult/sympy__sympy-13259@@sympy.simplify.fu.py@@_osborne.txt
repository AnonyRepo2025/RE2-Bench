1. The function `_osborne` is a transformation function that converts hyperbolic functions to their equivalent trigonometric functions.
2. The input `e` is a string representation of a mathematical expression.
3. The function `sympify` is used to convert the string into a symbolic expression.
4. The function `_osborne` is then applied to the symbolic expression.
5. The function `bottom_up` is a function that applies a function to each node in a tree from the bottom up.
6. The function `f` is applied to each node in the tree. If the node is a hyperbolic function, it is replaced with its equivalent trigonometric function.
