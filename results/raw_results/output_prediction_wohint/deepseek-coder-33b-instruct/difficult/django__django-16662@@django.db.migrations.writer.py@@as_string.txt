1. Inside `as_string`, it calls `MigrationWriter.serialize` for each operation in `self.migration.operations`. Since `self.migration.operations` is None, it skips the loop.
2. It then checks if `self.migration.replaces` is not None. Since it is None, it skips the if block.
3. It then checks if `self.include_header` is True or False. Since it is False, it skips the if block.
4. It then checks if `self.migration.initial` is True. Since it is not, it skips the if block.
5. It then checks if `self.needs_manual_porting` is True. Since it is not, it skips the if block.
6. It then checks if `imports` is not empty. Since it is empty, it skips the if block.
7. Finally, it returns the `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE` string with the `items` dictionary.
