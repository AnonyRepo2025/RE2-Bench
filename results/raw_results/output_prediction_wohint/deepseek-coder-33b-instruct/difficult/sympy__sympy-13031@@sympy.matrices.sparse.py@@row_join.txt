1. Inside `row_join`, it checks if `self.cols`=0 and `other.rows`=2, so it returns `self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)`.
2. Inside `_new`, it creates a new instance of `MutableSparseMatrix` with `rows`=2, `cols`=0, and `_smat`={}.
3. Then it calls `row_join` on the new instance with `other`.
4. Inside `row_join`, it checks if `A.rows`=`B.rows`=2, so it continues.
5. Then it checks if `B` is an instance of `SparseMatrix`, which is not the case here, so it continues.
6. Then it checks if `B._mat` is a sequence, which is not the case here, so it continues.
7. Then it checks if `B._smat` is a dictionary, which is the case here, so it iterates over `B._smat`.
8. For each key-value pair in `B._smat`, it adds the value to `A._smat` at the key plus `A.cols`.
9. Finally, it increments `A.cols` by `B.cols` and returns `A`.
