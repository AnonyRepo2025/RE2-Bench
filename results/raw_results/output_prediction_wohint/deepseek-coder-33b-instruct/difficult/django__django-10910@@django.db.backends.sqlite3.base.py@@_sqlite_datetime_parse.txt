1. Inside `_sqlite_datetime_parse`, it calls: dt = backend_utils.typecast_timestamp(dt)
2. Inside `typecast_timestamp`, it splits the input string into date and time parts.
3. It then calls `typecast_date` to convert the date part into a datetime object.
4. It then converts the time part into hours, minutes, and seconds.
5. It then creates a datetime object with the date, time, and timezone information.
