1. The input is a list of two elements: a list of 0s and 1s, and an integer 4.
2. The function checks if the type of data is list or tuple.
3. If the data is a list, it iterates over each sublist and total_num pair.
4. For each sublist, it calculates the reciprocal of the rank of the first non-zero element (1) and appends it to separate_result.
5. Finally, it returns the mean of separate_result and separate_result itself.
6. The mean of separate_result is 0.25, and separate_result is [0.25].
