1. The function `log_loss` is called with `y_true` = [0. 1.] and `y_pred` = [0. 1.].
2. The `eps` parameter is set to 'auto', so it will be set to `np.finfo(y_pred.dtype).eps`.
3. The `normalize` parameter is not provided, so it will be set to True by default.
4. The `sample_weight` parameter is not provided, so it will be set to None by default.
5. The `labels` parameter is not provided, so it will be set to None by default.
5. The `y_pred` array is checked to ensure it is a 2D array.
6. The `y_true` array is checked to ensure it is a 1D array.
7. The `y_pred` array is clipped to ensure all values are between `eps` and `1 - eps`.
8. The `y_pred` array is normalized so that each row sums to 1.
9. The `xlogy` function is called with `transformed_labels` and `y_pred`. This function returns the element-wise `x * log(y)`.
10. The `_weighted_sum` function is called with `loss`, `sample_weight`, and `normalize`. This function returns the weighted sum of `loss`.
