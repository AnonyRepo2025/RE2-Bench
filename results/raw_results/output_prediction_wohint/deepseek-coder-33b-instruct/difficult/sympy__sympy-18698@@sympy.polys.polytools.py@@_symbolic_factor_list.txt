1. Inside `_symbolic_factor_list`, `expr` = "x + 4", `opt` = {}, `method` = "factor".
2. `coeff` is initialized to S.One and `factors` is initialized to an empty list.
3. `args` is a list of arguments in `expr` after applying `Mul.make_args`. Here, `args` = [x + 4].
4. Since `method` = "factor", it calls `_poly_from_expr` to convert `expr` into a polynomial.
5. Inside `_poly_from_expr`, `expr` = "x + 4", `opt` = {}.
6. `opt.gens` is None, so `opt.gens` is set to `poly.gens`, which is [x].
7. `opt.domain` is None, so `opt.domain` is set to `poly.domain`, which is QQ.
8. `opt.polys` is None, so `opt.polys` is set to False.
9. `poly` is a polynomial with coefficients [1, 4] and variables [x].
10. `_poly_from_expr` returns `(poly, opt)`.
11. Inside `_symbolic_factor_list`, `_poly_from_expr` is called and `poly` is set to the polynomial returned by `_poly_from_expr`.
12. `func` is set to `poly.factor_list`.
13. `_coeff` and `_factors` are set to `func()`, which is `(S.One, [(x + 4, 1)])`.
14. `coeff` is multiplied by `_coeff`, which is S.One, so `coeff` remains S.One.
15. `factors` is extended by `_factors`, which is [(x + 4, 1)].
16. `_symbolic_factor_list` returns `(coeff, factors)`, which is (S.One, [(x + 4, 1)])
