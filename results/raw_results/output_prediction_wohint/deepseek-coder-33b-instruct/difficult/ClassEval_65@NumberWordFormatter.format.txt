The function `format` is called with `x` as `null`. In Python, `None` is equivalent to `null`.

The function `format` checks if `x` is `None`. If it is, it returns an empty string.

If `x` is not `None`, it calls `format_string` with `str(x)`.

The function `format_string` splits `x` into two parts: `lstr` and `rstr`. `lstr` is the part before the decimal point, and `rstr` is the part after the decimal point.

The function `format_string` then reverses `lstr` and adds '00' or '0' to the end of `lstr` if its length is not a multiple of 3.

The function `format_string` then splits `lstr` into groups of 3, and calls `trans_three` on each group.

The function `trans_three` converts a 3-digit number to words.

The function `format_string` then calls `parse_more` on each group.

The function `parse_more` returns the suffix for a group.

The function `format_string` then returns a string that contains the words for the number and the words for the decimal part.

So, `format(None)` will return an empty string.
