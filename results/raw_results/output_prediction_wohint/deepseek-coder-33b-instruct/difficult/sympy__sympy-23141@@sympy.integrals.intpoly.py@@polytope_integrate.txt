1. The function `polytope_integrate` is called with `poly` as an empty dictionary and `expr` as "x**2 + x*y + y**2".
2. Since `poly` is an empty dictionary, it means that the input is not a 2-PolytopeV-representation or a 3-PolytopeV-representation.
3. Since `max_degree` is not provided, it is set to None.
4. Since `expr` is not None, it means that the function will try to integrate the expression "x**2 + x*y + y**2".
5. The function `main_integrate` is called with `expr` as "x**2 + x*y + y**2".
6. The function `main_integrate` will try to integrate the expression "x**2 + x*y + y**2".
