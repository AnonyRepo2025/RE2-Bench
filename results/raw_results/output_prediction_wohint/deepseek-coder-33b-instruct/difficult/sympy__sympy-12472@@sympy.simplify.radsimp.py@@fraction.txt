1. Inside `fraction`, `expr` = "-x**3".
2. `numer` and `denom` are initialized as empty lists.
3. For each term in `expr`, if term is a commutative and either a power or an exponential, it is processed.
4. If term is a power, it is split into base and exponent.
5. If exponent is negative, it is added to `denom`.
6. If exponent is positive, it is added to `numer`.
7. If exponent is neither positive nor negative, it is added to `numer`.
8. If term is a rational number, it is split into numerator and denominator and added to `numer` and `denom` respectively.
9. If term is neither a power nor a rational number, it is added to `numer`.
10. Finally, `numer` and `denom` are converted to `Mul` and returned.
