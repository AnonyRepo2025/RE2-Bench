1. The function `_finger` takes an equation as input.
2. It first finds the free symbols in the equation.
3. Then it creates a dictionary `d` with the free symbols as keys and lists of 5 zeros as values.
4. It then iterates over the arguments of the equation.
5. If the argument is a symbol, it increments the first element of the list in `d` for that symbol.
6. If the argument is a Not, it increments the second element of the list in `d` for the symbol in the argument.
7. If the argument is neither a symbol nor a Not, it iterates over the arguments of the argument.
8. If the argument of the argument is a symbol, it increments the third element of the list in `d` for that symbol and increments the last element of the list in `d` by the number of arguments plus the number of Not arguments.
9. If the argument of the argument is a Not, it increments the fourth element of the list in `d` for the symbol in the argument.
10. It then creates a dictionary `inv` with the lists of `d` as keys and lists of symbols as values.
11. It then iterates over `d` in order of the keys.
12. If the length of the list of symbols in `inv` is greater than 1, it recursively calls `ordered` on the list of symbols.
13. It then yields the symbols in the list of symbols in `inv`.
14. It then removes the key from `inv`.
15. It then returns `inv`.
