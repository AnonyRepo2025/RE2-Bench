1. Inside `to_python`, it calls super().to_python(value) which calls the to_python method of the parent class CharField.
2. The value "http://www.example.com/category/" is passed as an argument to the to_python method of the CharField class.
3. The to_python method of the CharField class returns the value "http://www.example.com/category/".
4. The to_python method of the URLField class is then called with the value "http://www.example.com/category/".
5. The value "http://www.example.com/category/" is split into its components using the urlsplit function.
6. If the scheme is not present, it is assumed to be "https".
7. If the netloc is not present, it is assumed to be the same as the path.
8. The urlunsplit function is used to join the components back together.
9. The to_python method of the URLField class returns the value "https://www.example.com/category/".
