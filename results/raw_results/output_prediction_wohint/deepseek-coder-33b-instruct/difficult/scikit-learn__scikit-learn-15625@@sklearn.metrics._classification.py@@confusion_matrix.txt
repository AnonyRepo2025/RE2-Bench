1. The function `confusion_matrix` is called with `y_true` and `y_pred` as input.
2. `_check_targets` is called to check the type of `y_true` and `y_pred`.
3. `check_consistent_length` is called to check if `y_true` and `y_pred` have the same length.
4. `type_of_target` is called to check the type of `y_true` and `y_pred`.
5. `unique_labels` is called to get the unique labels from `y_true` and `y_pred`.
6. `_unique_multiclass` is called to get the unique labels from `y_true` and `y_pred`.
7. `check_array` is called to check if `y_true` and `y_pred` are array-like.
8. `coo_matrix` is called to create a confusion matrix.
9. The confusion matrix is returned.
