1. The `other` is a string "picoweber".
2. The `self` is an empty dictionary.
3. Since `self` is not an instance of `Basic`, it tries to convert `other` to a sympy object using `_sympify(other)`.
4. `_sympify(other)` tries to convert `other` to a sympy object by calling `sympify(other, strict=True)`.
5. `sympify(other, strict=True)` tries to convert `other` to a sympy object by calling `parse_expr(other, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)`.
6. `parse_expr(other, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)` tries to parse `other` as a sympy expression.
7. Since `other` is not a valid sympy expression, it raises a `SympifyError`.
8. `SympifyError` is a subclass of `Exception`, so it is not equal to `other`.
