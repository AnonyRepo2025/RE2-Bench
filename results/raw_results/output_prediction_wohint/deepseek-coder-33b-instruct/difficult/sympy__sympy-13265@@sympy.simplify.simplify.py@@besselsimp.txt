1. The input is a string representation of a mathematical expression.
2. The function `besselsimp` is used to simplify the expression.
3. The expression contains the Bessel function of the first kind, the Bessel function of the second kind, the Bessel function of the third kind, and the Bessel function of the fourth kind.
4. The expression also contains the exponential function, the exponential function in polar form, and the imaginary unit.
5. The expression is simplified by replacing the Bessel functions with their equivalent expressions, expanding the expressions, and factoring the expression.
