1. Inside `diop_solve`, it calls `classify_diop(eq, _dict=False)`.
2. Inside `classify_diop`, it first checks if `eq` is a valid equation. If it is, it extracts the variables and coefficients.
3. It then checks the type of the equation. In this case, it is a 'linear' equation.
4. It then calls `_diop_linear(var, coeff, param)`.
