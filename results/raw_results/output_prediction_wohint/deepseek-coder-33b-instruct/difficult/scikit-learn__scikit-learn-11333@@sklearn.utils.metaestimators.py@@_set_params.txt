1. Inside `_set_params`, it first checks if `attr` is in `params`. If it is, it removes `attr` from `params` and sets the attribute of `self` to the value of `attr`.
2. It then checks if any of the keys in `params` are nested (i.e., contain '__'). If they are, it separates the key into the name of the attribute and the sub-key, and sets the sub-key of the attribute to the value of the key.
3. Finally, it sets the remaining keys in `params` as attributes of `self`.
4. In this case, `attr` is "_transformers", and `params` is {"n_jobs": 2}. Since "n_jobs" is not nested, it sets the attribute "n_jobs" of `self` to 2.

```
{
    "self": {
        "transformers": null,
        "remainder": "drop",
        "n_jobs": 2,
        "transformer_weights": null
    }
