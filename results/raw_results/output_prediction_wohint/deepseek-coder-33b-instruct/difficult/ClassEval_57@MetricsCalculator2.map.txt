1. The function `map` is called with an empty list as argument.
2. The function checks if the input is a list or a tuple. It is a list, so it proceeds to the next step.
3. The function checks if the list is empty. It is, so it returns a tuple with the first element being 0.0 and the second element being a list with a single element 0.0.
4. Therefore, `map([])` will return: (0.0, [0.0])
