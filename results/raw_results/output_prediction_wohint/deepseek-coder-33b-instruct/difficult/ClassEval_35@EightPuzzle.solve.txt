The solve() function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the solution. It starts with the initial state and explores all possible moves from the current state. If a move leads to a state that has not been visited before, it is added to the open list. The search continues until the goal state is found or all possible states have been explored.

In this case, the initial state is already the goal state, so the function will return an empty list, indicating that no moves are needed to reach the goal state from the initial state.
