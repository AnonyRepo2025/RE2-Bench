1. The input is a string representation of a mathematical expression.
2. The function `do` is a recursive function that applies a series of transformations to the input expression.
3. The transformations include:
    - Factoring out common terms
    - Simplifying powers
    - Converting fractions to their simplest form
    - Converting expressions to their simplest form
4. The output of the function is the simplified form of the input expression.
