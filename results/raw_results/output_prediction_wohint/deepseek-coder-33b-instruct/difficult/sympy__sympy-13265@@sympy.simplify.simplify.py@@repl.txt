The function `repl` is not defined in the provided code. It seems to be a placeholder for a function that will be used to replace certain parts of an expression. The function is likely to be used in a context where it will be passed as an argument to a method like `replace` or `rewrite`. The exact behavior of `repl` would depend on the context in which it is used.
