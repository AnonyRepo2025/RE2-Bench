1. Inside `__add__`, it creates a new Media object `combined`.
2. `combined._css_lists` is a copy of `self._css_lists`, which is None. So, `combined._css_lists` is an empty list.
3. `combined._js_lists` is a copy of `self._js_lists`, which is None. So, `combined._js_lists` is an empty list.
4. For each item in `other._css_lists`, if the item is not in `self._css_lists`, it is appended to `combined._css_lists`. Since `other._css_lists` is an empty list, no items are appended.
5. For each item in `other._js_lists`, if the item is not in `self._js_lists`, it is appended to `combined._js_lists`. Since `other._js_lists` is an empty list, no items are appended.
6. Finally, `combined` is returned.
