1. The input is a string representation of a mathematical expression.
2. The function `exptrigsimp` simplifies the expression by applying various rules.
3. The rules are defined in the function `exp_trig` and `f`.
4. The function `bottom_up` is used to apply the rules to the expression.
5. The function `sympify` is used to convert the string representation of the expression into a symbolic expression.
