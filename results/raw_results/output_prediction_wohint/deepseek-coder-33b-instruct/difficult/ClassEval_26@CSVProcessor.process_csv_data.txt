1. __init__() does nothing.
2. process_csv_data(N=1, save_file_name="read_test.csv") calls read_csv(file_name="read_test.csv")
3. read_csv("read_test.csv") opens the file "read_test.csv" and reads it line by line.
4. The first line is the title, and the rest are data.
5. It then extracts the Nth column from each row of data, converts it to uppercase, and stores it in column_data.
6. It then creates a new list new_data with the title and the processed column data.
7. Finally, it calls write_csv(data=new_data, file_name="read_test_process.csv")
8. write_csv() tries to write the data to the file "read_test_process.csv". If it succeeds, it returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.
