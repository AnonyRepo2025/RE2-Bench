2. `is_valid_move` checks if pos1 and pos2 are within the board size. They are, so it continues.
3. It checks if pos1 and pos2 are the same. They are not, so it continues.
4. It checks if the icons at pos1 and pos2 are the same. They are, so it continues.
5. It checks if there is a path from pos1 to pos2. There is, so it returns True.
