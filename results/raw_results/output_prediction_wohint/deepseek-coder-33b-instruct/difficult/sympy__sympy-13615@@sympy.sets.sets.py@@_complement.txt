1. Inside `_complement`, `other` is a FiniteSet with elements {10, 15}.
2. Since `other` is a FiniteSet, it calls:
    return Union((o - self for o in other.args))
3. `other.args` is a list of elements in the FiniteSet, so it will return a Union of the elements in the FiniteSet minus `self`.
[/THOUGHT]

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "strpath": "Union(10 - self, 15 - self)"
}
```
[/OUTPUT]
