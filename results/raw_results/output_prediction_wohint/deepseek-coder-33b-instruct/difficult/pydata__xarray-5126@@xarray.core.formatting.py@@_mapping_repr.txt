1. The function `_mapping_repr` is called with the arguments:
    - `mapping`: {"foo": "bar"}
    - `title`: "Attributes"
    - `summarizer`: {}
    - `expand_option_name`: "display_expand_attrs"
    - `col_width`: None
    - `max_rows`: None
2. Since `col_width` is None, it calls `_calculate_col_width` with `col_items` = {"foo": "bar"}.
3. `_calculate_col_width` returns the maximum length of the keys in `mapping` plus 6.
4. Since `max_rows` is None, it is set to OPTIONS['display_max_rows'].
5. Since `mapping` is not empty, it checks if `expand_option_name` is False. Since `expand_option_name` is "display_expand_attrs", it calls `OPTIONS['display_expand_attrs']`.
6. Since `OPTIONS['display_expand_attrs']` is not False, it checks if the length of `mapping` is greater than `max_rows`.
7. Since the length of `mapping` is 1 and `max_rows` is 1000, it does not enter the if block.
8. It then calls `summarizer` with `k` = "foo", `v` = "bar", and `col_width`.
9. `summarizer` is an empty dictionary, so it raises a TypeError.
