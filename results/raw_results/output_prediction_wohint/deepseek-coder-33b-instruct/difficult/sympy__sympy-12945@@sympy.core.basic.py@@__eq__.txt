1. The `__eq__` method is called with `self` as an instance of `Basic` and `other` as "I*x".
2. The `other` is converted to a sympy object using `sympify`.
3. The `sympify` method tries to convert "I*x" to a sympy object.
4. "I*x" is a string, so it is converted to a sympy object using `parse_expr`.
5. The `parse_expr` method tries to parse "I*x" and returns a sympy object.
6. The `__eq__` method is called with `self` as an instance of `Basic` and `other` as the sympy object returned by `parse_expr`.
7. The `__eq__` method compares the `_hashable_content` of `self` and `other`.
8. The `_hashable_content` of `self` is `(I, x)` and the `_hashable_content` of `other` is `(I, x)`.
9. Since `(I, x)` == `(I, x)`, the `__eq__` method returns `True`.
