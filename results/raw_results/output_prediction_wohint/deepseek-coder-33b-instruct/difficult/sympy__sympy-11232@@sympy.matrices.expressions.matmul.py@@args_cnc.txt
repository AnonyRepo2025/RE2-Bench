1. Inside `args_cnc`, it calls `self.as_coeff_matrices()`.
2. Inside `as_coeff_matrices`, it first finds all scalars in `self.args` and all matrices in `self.args`.
3. Since `self.args` is empty, both `scalars` and `matrices` are empty.
4. Then it returns `(coeff, matrices)`, where `coeff` is the product of all scalars and `matrices` is all matrices.
5. Since `scalars` is empty, `coeff` is 1.
6. Since `matrices` is empty, `matrices` is also empty.
