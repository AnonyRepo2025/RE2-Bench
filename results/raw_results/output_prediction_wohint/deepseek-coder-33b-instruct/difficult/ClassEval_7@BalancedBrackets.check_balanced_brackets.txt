1. __init__(expr="[(){}") initializes the object with the given expression.
2. clear_expr() removes all characters from the expression that are not brackets. The expression becomes "[(]"
3. check_balanced_brackets() checks if the brackets in the expression are balanced.
4. The first character is "[", which is a left bracket, so it is added to the stack.
5. The second character is "(", which is a left bracket, so it is added to the stack.
6. The third character is ")", which is a right bracket. The top of the stack is "(", which is a matching pair. The top of the stack is removed.
7. The fourth character is "}", which is a right bracket. The top of the stack is "[", which is not a matching pair. The function returns False.
