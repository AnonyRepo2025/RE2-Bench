1. The function `sympify` is called with `a` = "{2.0, 3}".
2. Since `a` is a string, it tries to parse the string as a mathematical expression.
3. The string "{2.0, 3}" is not a valid mathematical expression, so it raises a `SympifyError`.

[OUTPUT]
```
{
    "error": "SympifyError: could not parse '{2.0, 3}'"
}
```
