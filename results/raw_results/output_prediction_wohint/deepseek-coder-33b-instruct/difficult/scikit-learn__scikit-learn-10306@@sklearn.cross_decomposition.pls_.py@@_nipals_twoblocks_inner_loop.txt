1. The function `_nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop` is a part of the PLS (Partial Least Squares) algorithm, which is a method used for dimension reduction and feature extraction.
2. The function takes in two matrices X and Y, and performs an iterative process to find the weights for X and Y that maximize the covariance between the two.
3. The mode parameter determines whether the weights for X or Y are calculated first.
4. The function will iterate until the change in the weights is less than the tolerance or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
5. The function returns the weights for X and Y, and the number of iterations.
