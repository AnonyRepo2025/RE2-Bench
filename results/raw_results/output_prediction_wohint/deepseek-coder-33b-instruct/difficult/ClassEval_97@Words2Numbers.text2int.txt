1. The function `text2int` takes a string of words and converts it into a number.
2. The string "thirty-two" is split into words: "thirty", "-", "two".
3. For each word, if it's in `ordinal_words`, it's converted to a number and added to the current number.
4. If the word is not in `ordinal_words`, but ends with "ieth" or "th", it's replaced with the corresponding number.
5. If the word is not in `ordinal_words` and does not end with "ieth" or "th", it's added to the current string.
6. If the word is in `numwords`, it's converted to a number and added to the current number.
7. If the word is not in `numwords`, it's added to the current string.
8. The current number is added to the result.
9. The current number and current string are reset.
10. The result is returned as a string.
