1. The input is a string "R3 + R4 + 4050".
2. The function `sympify` is called to convert the string into a sympy expression.
3. The sympy expression is "R3 + R4 + 4050".
4. The function `do` is called to factor the terms.
5. The function `do` calls `expr.as_content_primitive`, but `expr` is not an instance of `Sum` or `Integral`, so it goes to the `elif` block.
6. The function `gcd_terms` is called to find the greatest common divisor of the terms.
7. The function `gcd_terms` calls `gcd`, which finds the greatest common divisor of the terms.
8. The function `gcd` returns the greatest common divisor of the terms.
9. The function `_keep_coeff` is called to keep the coefficient of the terms.
10. The function `_keep_coeff` returns the coefficient of the terms.
