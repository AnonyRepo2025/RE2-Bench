1. The function `_parse_scatter_color_args` is a static method of the class `Axes`. It takes 4 arguments: `self`, `c`, `edgecolors`, and `kwargs`.
2. `c` is null, `edgecolors` is "r", and `kwargs` is an empty dictionary.
3. `xsize` is 2, and `get_next_color_func` is an empty dictionary.
4. Since `c` is null, `c_was_none` is True.
5. Since `c` is null and `kwargs` does not contain a 'color' key, `kwcolor` is also null.
6. Since `edgecolors` is "r", `edgecolors` remains "r".
7. Since `c` is null, `c_is_string_or_strings` is False.
8. Since `c` is null and `kwargs` does not contain a 'color' key, `c` is set to "b" (default color).
9. Since `c` is "b", `colors` is set to the RGBA value of "b".
10. The function returns a tuple: (c, colors, edgecolors).
