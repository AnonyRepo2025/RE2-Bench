2. The new position is (2, 2).
3. The new position is not a wall, so the player moves there.
4. The new position contains a box, so the box is moved one step in the same direction.
5. The new box position is (3, 2) and is not a wall, so the box moves there.
6. The game is not over, so the function returns False.
