1. The function `fit` is called with X and y as arguments.
2. X and y are checked for correctness using `check_X_y`.
3. If X is sparse and `fit_intercept` is True, the function `_ridge_regression` is called.
4. If X is not sparse or `fit_intercept` is False, the function `_ridge_regression` is called.
5. The function `_ridge_regression` is a private function and is not defined in the provided code.
6. The function `_set_intercept` is called to set the intercept.
