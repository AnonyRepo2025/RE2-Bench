1. Inside `_make_test_folds`, y = column_or_1d(y) converts y to a 1D array.
2. Then, y = np.asarray(y) converts y to a numpy array.
3. Then, y_encoded = class_perm[y_inv] is used to encode y.
4. Then, y_order = np.sort(y_encoded) is used to sort y_encoded.
5. Then, allocation = np.asarray([np.bincount(y_order[i::self.n_splits], minlength=n_classes) for i in range(self.n_splits)]) is used to allocate y_order.
6. Then, test_folds = np.empty(len(y), dtype='i') is used to create an empty array of length y.
7. Then, for k in range(n_classes): folds_for_class = np.arange(self.n_splits).repeat(allocation[:, k]) is used to create folds for each class.
8. Then, if self.shuffle: rng.shuffle(folds_for_class) is used to shuffle folds_for_class.
9. Then, test_folds[y_encoded == k] = folds_for_class is used to assign folds_for_class to test_folds.
