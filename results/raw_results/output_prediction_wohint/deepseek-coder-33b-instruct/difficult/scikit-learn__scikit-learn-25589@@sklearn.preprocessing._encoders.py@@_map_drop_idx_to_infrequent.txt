The function `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` is a method of a class that is used to map the index of a category to be dropped to the index of the infrequent category.

The input is a dictionary with the following keys:
- `self`: a dictionary containing the attributes of the class instance.
- `args`: a dictionary containing the positional arguments of the function.
- `kwargs`: a dictionary containing the keyword arguments of the function.

The function takes two arguments: `feature_idx` and `drop_idx`. `feature_idx` is the index of the feature, and `drop_idx` is the index of the category to be dropped.

The function first checks if infrequent categories are enabled. If not, it simply returns the `drop_idx`.

If infrequent categories are enabled, it retrieves the default mapping from the infrequent categories for the given feature index. If the default mapping is `None`, it returns the `drop_idx`. Otherwise, it retrieves the indices of the infrequent categories for the given feature index.

If the `drop_idx` is in the infrequent indices, it raises a `ValueError` because it is not possible to drop an infrequent category. Otherwise, it returns the index of the category in the original categories that corresponds to the `drop_idx` in the infrequent categories.
