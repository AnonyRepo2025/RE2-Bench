1. The `transform` method is called with the input "2 + 4 / 4". It removes all whitespace and replaces "-" with "~" if it's a unary operator. The result is "2+4/4".
2. The `prepare` method is called with the transformed expression "2+4/4". It converts the infix expression to postfix notation. The result is "244/+".
3. The `calculate` method is called with the postfix expression "244/+". It calculates the result of the postfix expression.
4. The `calculate` method first reverses the postfix stack to "+/442".
5. It then iterates over the reversed postfix stack.
6. If the current operator is not an operator, it appends it to the result stack.
7. If the current operator is an operator, it pops two values from the result stack, calculates the result, and appends it to the result stack.
8. The result stack is then converted to a string and evaluated to get the final result.
9. The final result is 3.0.
