1. The function `answer` is called with the expression "1+1+1+2".
2. The function checks if the expression is "pass". If it is, it calls `get_my_cards` and returns the cards.
3. If the expression is not "pass", it creates a dictionary `statistic` to count the number of times each digit appears in the expression.
4. It then creates a copy of `statistic` called `nums_used`.
5. It iterates over the cards in `self.nums`. If a card is in `nums_used` and its count is greater than 0, it decrements the count.
6. If all counts in `nums_used` are 0, it evaluates the expression.
7. The function `evaluate_expression` evaluates the expression using the `eval` function. If the result is 24, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
8. If an exception occurs during the evaluation, it catches the exception and returns False.
9. If all counts in `nums_used` are not 0, it returns False.
10. Therefore, the output of `answer("1+1+1+2")` will be False.
