1. The function `make_classification` generates a random dataset for classification problems.
2. The parameters are:
    - n_samples: 200
    - n_features: 2
    - n_informative: 2
    - n_redundant: 0
    - n_repeated: 0
    - n_classes: 4
    - n_clusters_per_class: 1
    - weights: None
    - flip_y: 0
    - class_sep: 1000000.0
    - hypercube: False
    - shift: 0
    - scale: 1
    - shuffle: False
    - random_state: 0
3. The function first checks if the sum of n_informative, n_redundant and n_repeated is less than n_features. If not, it raises a ValueError.
4. Then it checks if n_informative is less than log2(n_classes * n_clusters_per_class). If not, it raises a ValueError.
5. If weights is not None, it checks if its length is either n_classes or n_classes - 1. If not, it raises a ValueError.
6. It then generates the centroids for each class.
7. It generates the informative features for each class.
8. If n_redundant is greater than 0, it generates the redundant features for each class.
9. If n_repeated is greater than 0, it generates the repeated features for each class.
10. If shift is None, it generates the shift for each feature.
11. If scale is None, it generates the scale for each feature.
12. If shuffle is True, it shuffles the features and the labels.
13. It returns the generated dataset.
