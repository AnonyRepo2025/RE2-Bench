1. Inside `distance`, since `p` is not an instance of `Point`, it checks if `len(p) == len(self)`. Since `self` is an empty point, `len(self)` is 0, and `len(p)` is 2, so it returns `False`.
2. Then it checks if `len(p)` is equal to the length of `self`. Since `self` is an empty point, `len(self)` is 0, and `len(p)` is 2, so it returns `False`.
3. Finally, it calculates the Euclidean distance between `self` and `p`. Since `self` is an empty point, `self.args` is an empty list, and `p` is a list of two elements, `[6, 3]`, so it calculates the Euclidean distance between an empty list and a list of two elements.
