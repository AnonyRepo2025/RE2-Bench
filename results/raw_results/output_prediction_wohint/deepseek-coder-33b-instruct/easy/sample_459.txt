Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `arr` and `d`. `arr` is a list of strings, and `d` is a dictionary.
2. The for loop starts from index 1 (second element) and increments by 2 each time (so it only iterates over the odd indices).
3. For each iteration, it updates the dictionary `d` with a new key-value pair. The key is the current element in `arr` (odd index), and the value is the previous element in `arr` (even index).
4. After the loop, the function returns the updated dictionary `d`.
5. The output will be the updated dictionary `d`.

1. The function `f` takes one argument: `arr`, which is a list of integers.
2. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list. For each element `i` in `arr`, if `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`), it is included in the new list.
3. The output will be the new list of even numbers.
