1. __init__(data=[1 2 3 4]) stores self.data = np.array([1 2 3 4]).
2. get_variance() calculates the variance of self.data.
3. np.var(self.data) calculates the variance of [1 2 3 4] which is 1.25.
4. round(np.var(self.data), 2) rounds the variance to 2 decimal places, so it becomes 1.25.

1. isValid("()[]{}") checks if the string s is a valid parentheses.
2. It uses a stack to store the opening brackets.
3. For each character in s:
    - If the character is an opening bracket, it is added to the stack.
    - If the character is a closing bracket, it checks if the last opening bracket in the stack matches it. If it does, the opening bracket is removed from the stack. If it doesn't, the string is not valid.
4. If the stack is empty at the end, the string is valid. If it's not, the string is not valid.
5. In this case, the string is valid, so it returns True.
