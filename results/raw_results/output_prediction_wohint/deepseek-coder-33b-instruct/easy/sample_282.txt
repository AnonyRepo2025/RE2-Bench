1. The function `f` takes two strings `s1` and `s2` as input.
2. It initializes `position` to 1 and `count` to 0.
3. It enters a while loop where it keeps finding the position of `s2` in `s1` starting from the `position`.
4. If `s2` is found, it increments `count` by 1 and moves `position` to the next character.
5. If `s2` is not found, the loop breaks.
6. Finally, it returns `count`.
