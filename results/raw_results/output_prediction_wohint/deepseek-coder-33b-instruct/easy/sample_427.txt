1. The function `f` takes a string `s` as input.
2. `count` is initialized to the length of `s` minus 1.
3. `reverse_s` is the reversed string `s`.
4. The while loop continues until `count` is greater than 0 and 'sea' is not found in the reversed string `reverse_s`.
5. In each iteration, `count` is decremented by 1 and `reverse_s` is updated to be the substring of `reverse_s` from the start to `count`.
6. The function returns the substring of `reverse_s` from `count` to the end.
