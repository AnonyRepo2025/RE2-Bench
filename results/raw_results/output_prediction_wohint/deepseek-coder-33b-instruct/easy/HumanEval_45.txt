1. The function `triangle_area` takes two arguments: `a` and `h`.
2. It returns the area of a triangle, which is calculated as `a * h / 2.0`.
3. So, the area of a triangle with `a` = 10 and `h` = 8 is `10 * 8 / 2.0 = 40.0`.

What will be the output of `fibonacci` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "inputs": {
        "n": 10
    }
}
```
[/INPUT]

[THOUGHT]
1. The function `fibonacci` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list.
3. If `n` is 1, it returns a list with one element: 0.
4. If `n` is 2, it returns a list with two elements: 0 and 1.
5. If `n` is greater than 2, it initializes a list `fib` with the first two elements of the Fibonacci sequence: 0 and 1.
6. Then, it enters a while loop that continues until `fib` has `n` elements. In each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two elements of `fib` to `fib`.
7. Finally, it returns `fib`.
8. So, the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.

What will be the output of `is_prime` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "inputs": {
        "n": 17
    }
}
```
[/INPUT]

[THOUGHT]
1. The function `is_prime` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns False.
3. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, it returns True.
4. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns False.
5. Then, it enters a while loop that continues until `i * i` is greater than `n`. In each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`. If it is, it returns False.
6. If `n` is not divisible by any number in the loop, it returns True.
7. So, 17 is a prime number, so the function returns True.

def factorial(n):

What will be the output of `factorial` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "inputs": {
        "n": 5
    }
}
```
[/INPUT]

[THOUGHT]
1. The function `factorial` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. If `n` is 0, it returns 1.
3. If `n` is not 0, it returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`.
4. This is a recursive function, so it calls itself with `n-1` until `n` is 0.
5. So, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

```
[/INPUT]

[THOUGHT]
1. The function `bubble_sort` takes a list `lst` as input.
2. It sorts the list in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
3. Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
4. So, the sorted list will be [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90].

What will be the output of `linear_search` given the following input:

    }
}
```
[/INPUT]

[THOUGHT]
1. The function `linear_search` takes a list `lst` and an element `x` as input.
2. It searches for `x` in `lst` using the Linear Search algorithm.
3. Linear Search works by comparing each element in the list with `x` until it finds a match.
4. So, 110 is found at index 6 in the list.
