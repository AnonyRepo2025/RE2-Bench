1. The function `f` takes a string `text` as input.
2. `ls = text[::-1]` reverses the string `text`. So `ls` will be "alacs".
3. `text2 = ''` initializes an empty string `text2`.
4. The for loop iterates over the reversed string `ls` in steps of 3, starting from the 4th character (index 3) and going backwards to the 1st character (index 0).
5. For each group of 3 characters, `'---'.join(ls[i:i + 3])` joins them with "---" and adds them to `text2`.
6. After the loop, `text2[:-3]` removes the last "---" from `text2`.
7. The function returns `text2`.

What will be the output of `f` given the following input:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},

        "n": 5

[THOUGHT]
1. The function `f` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. If `n` is 0, it returns 0.
3. If `n` is not 0, it returns `n` plus the result of calling `f` with `n - 1`.
4. This is a recursive function, so it will keep calling itself with decreasing values of `n` until `n` is 0.
5. The sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is returned.
