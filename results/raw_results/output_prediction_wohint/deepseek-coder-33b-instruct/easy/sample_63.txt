1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `prefix`.
2. The while loop will keep running as long as `text` starts with `prefix`.
3. In each iteration, `text` is sliced from the index where `prefix` ends to the end of the string.
4. If `text` is empty after slicing, it will return the original `text`.
5. The loop will stop when `text` no longer starts with `prefix`.
6. The function will return the remaining part of `text` after removing all occurrences of `prefix` from the start.

[THOUGHT]
1. The function `f` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. If `n` is 0, it returns 0.
3. If `n` is not 0, it returns `n` plus the result of calling `f` with `n - 1`.
4. This is a recursive function, so it will keep calling itself with decreasing values of `n` until `n` is 0.
5. The sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) will be returned.

1. The function `f` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. If `n` is 0, it returns 0.
3. If `n` is not 0, it returns `n` multiplied by the result of calling `f` with `n - 1`.
4. This is a recursive function, so it will keep calling itself with decreasing values of `n` until `n` is 0.
5. The product of all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) will be returned.
