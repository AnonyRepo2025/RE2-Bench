1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `s` and `p`. `s` is the string to be partitioned and `p` is the separator.
2. The `partition` method of a string splits the string into three parts: the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator.
3. The lengths of these three parts are calculated and stored in `part_one`, `part_two`, and `part_three`.
4. The condition `part_one >= 2 and part_two <= 2 and (part_three >= 2)` checks if the length of the first part is at least 2, the length of the second part is at most 2, and the length of the third part is at least 2.
5. If the condition is true, the function returns the concatenation of the reversed first part, the second part, the reversed third part, and a '#' symbol.
6. If the condition is false, the function returns the concatenation of the three parts without any modifications.
