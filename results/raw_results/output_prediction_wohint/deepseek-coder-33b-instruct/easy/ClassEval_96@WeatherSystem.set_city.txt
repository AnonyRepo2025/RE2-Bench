1. `set_city` is called with "Beijing" as an argument.
2. `set_city` sets `self.city` to "Beijing".
3. `set_city` does not return anything, so the output is `None`.

1. `isValid` is called with "()[]{}" as an argument.
2. `isValid` initializes an empty list `stack` and a dictionary `mapping`.
3. `isValid` iterates over each character in the string "()[]{}".
4. For the first character "(", it is not in `mapping`, so it is appended to `stack`.
5. For the second character ")", it is in `mapping`, so `top_element` is popped from `stack` (which is "(") and compared to `mapping[")"]` (which is "("). They are the same, so nothing happens.
6. For the third character "{", it is not in `mapping`, so it is appended to `stack`.
7. For the fourth character "}", it is in `mapping`, so `top_element` is popped from `stack` (which is "{") and compared to `mapping["}"]` (which is "{"). They are the same, so nothing happens.
8. For the fifth character "[", it is not in `mapping`, so it is appended to `stack`.
9. For the sixth character "]", it is in `mapping`, so `top_element` is popped from `stack` (which is "[") and compared to `mapping["]"]` (which is "["). They are the same, so nothing happens.
10. After all characters are processed, `stack` is empty, so `isValid` returns `True`.
