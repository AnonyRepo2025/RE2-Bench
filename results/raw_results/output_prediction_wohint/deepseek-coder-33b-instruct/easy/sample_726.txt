Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `ws` is initialized to 0.
2. The for loop iterates over each character in the string `text`.
3. If the character is a whitespace (checked by `s.isspace()`), `ws` is incremented by 1.
4. The function returns a tuple containing the number of whitespace characters and the length of the string.
5. In the given string, there are no whitespace characters, so `ws` remains 0.
6. The length of the string is 30.

Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` is defined to take an integer `n` as input.
2. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.
3. If `n` is not 0, the function returns `n` plus the result of calling `f` with `n - 1`.
4. This process repeats until `n` is 0, at which point the function returns 0.
5. The sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` is returned.
