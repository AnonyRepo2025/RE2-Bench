Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `add` takes a list `lst` as an argument.
2. The list comprehension `[lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0]` generates a new list that includes every second element of `lst` that is even.
3. The `sum` function then adds up all the elements in this new list.
4. The return value will be the sum of the even elements at odd indices in the list.
5. In the given list, the elements at odd indices are 4 and 6. However, only 4 is even, so the sum will be 4.
