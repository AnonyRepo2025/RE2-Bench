Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `text.rpartition('0')` splits the string into three parts: everything before the last occurrence of '0', the '0' itself, and everything after the '0'. The result is `('qq', '0', 'tt')`.
2. `l[2] == ''` is False, so we skip the if branch.
3. `f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find('0') + 1}'` returns a string that is the length of the first part of the split string (`'qq'`), a colon, and the position of the '0' in the second part of the split string (`'tt'`). The position is found with `find('0')`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of '0' in the string, and we add 1 because we want the position to be 1-based, not 0-based. The result is `'2:1'`.

Let's execute the code step by step.
1. `range(1, n+1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
2. `if n % i == 0` checks if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., if `i` is a divisor of `n`).
3. If `i` is a divisor of `n`, `i` is included in the list.
4. The list comprehension generates a list of all divisors of `n`.
5. The result is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]`.
