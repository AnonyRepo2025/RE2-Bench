1. The function `f` takes three arguments: `n`, `m`, and `text`.
2. The first line of the function checks if `text` is an empty string. If it is, the function returns `text`.
3. The next three lines split `text` into three parts: `head`, `mid`, and `tail`.
4. The `head` is the first character of `text`, `mid` is all characters of `text` except the first and last, and `tail` is the last character of `text`.
5. The `joined` variable is the concatenation of `head`, `mid`, and `tail`, with all occurrences of `n` replaced with `m`.
6. The function returns `joined`.
