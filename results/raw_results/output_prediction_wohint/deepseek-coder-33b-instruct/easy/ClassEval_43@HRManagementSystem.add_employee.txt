1. `add_employee(employee_id=1, name="John Doe", position="Manager", department="HR", salary=5000)` is called.
2. The employee_id 1 is already in the system, so the function returns False.

[THOUGHT]

1. `isValid("()")` is called.
2. The first character is "(", which is not in the mapping dictionary, so it is appended to the stack.
3. The second character is ")", which is in the mapping dictionary, so the top element of the stack is popped and compared with the corresponding value in the mapping dictionary. In this case, the top element is "(", which matches the value in the mapping dictionary, so the function continues.
4. The stack is empty, so the function returns True.
