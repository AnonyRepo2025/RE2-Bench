1. The function `f` counts the number of times `part` occurs in `full`.
2. `length` is the length of `part`, which is 2.
3. `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `part` in `full`.
4. `count` is the number of times `part` occurs in `full`.
5. The while loop continues until `index` is less than 0, which means `part` is not found in `full`.
6. In each iteration of the loop, `full` is updated to be the substring of `full` starting from the character after the current `index`, and `index` is updated to be the index of the next occurrence of `part` in `full`.
7. The function returns `count`, which is the number of times `part` occurs in `full`.

1. The function `f` is a recursive function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 0 to `n`.
2. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0.
3. If `n` is not 0, the function returns `n` plus the result of calling `f` with `n - 1`.
4. This process repeats until `n` is 0, at which point the function returns 0.
5. The sum of all numbers from 0 to `n` is returned.
