1. The function `f` takes two arguments: a list of chemicals and a number.
2. The function creates a new list `fish` which is a copy of the input list `chemicals` without the first element.
3. The function reverses the order of the input list `chemicals`.
4. The function enters a loop that runs `num` times. In this case, `num` is 0, so the loop doesn't run.
5. The function reverses the order of the input list `chemicals` again.
6. The function returns the input list `chemicals`.
