The function `f` takes a string `text` and a string `characters`. It iterates over the `characters` string, and for each character, it removes all occurrences of that character from the end of `text`.

Here's the reasoning process:
1. The `characters` string is "x.r".
2. The `text` string is "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r".
3. The first character of `characters` is "x". There are no "x" characters in `text`, so `text` remains unchanged.
4. The second character of `characters` is ".". There are no "." characters in `text`, so `text` remains unchanged.
5. The third character of `characters` is "r". There are "r" characters at the end of `text`, so they are removed.
6. The `text` string becomes "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;".
7. The `characters` string is "x.r".
8. The first character of `characters` is "x". There are no "x" characters in `text`, so `text` remains unchanged.
9. The second character of `characters` is ".". There are no "." characters in `text`, so `text` remains unchanged.
10. The third character of `characters` is "r". There are "r" characters at the end of `text`, so they are removed.
11. The `text` string becomes "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;".
12. The `characters` string is "x.r".
13. The first character of `characters` is "x". There are no "x" characters in `text`, so `text` remains unchanged.
14. The second character of `characters` is ".". There are no "." characters in `text`, so `text` remains unchanged.
15. The third character of `characters` is "r". There are "r" characters at the end of `text`, so they are removed.
