Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` takes a list of numbers as input.
2. The for loop starts from the second last element of the list (index `len(nums) - 2`) and goes backwards to the first element (index `0`).
3. If the current number is even (`nums[i] % 2 == 0`), it is removed from the list (`nums.remove(nums[i])`).
4. The function returns the modified list.
5. In the given input, the list `nums` is `[5, 3, 3, 7]`.
6. The loop starts from the second last element (`3`), checks if it is even, and it is not.
7. Then it moves to the third last element (`3`), checks if it is even, and it is not.
8. Finally, it checks the first element (`5`), and it is not even.
9. So, the function returns the original list `[5, 3, 3, 7]`.
