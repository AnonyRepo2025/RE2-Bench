1. mean([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]) calculates the mean of the list.
2. sum(data) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 25
3. len(data) = 6
4. sum(data) / len(data) = 25 / 6 = 4.17
5. round(4.17, 2) = 4.17
Therefore, `mean([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7])` will return: 4.17

        ],
        "target": 9
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]

[THOUGHT]
1. twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) finds two numbers in the list that add up to the target.
2. The first number is 2. The complement of 2 in the target is 7. 7 is not in the hashmap. So, add 2 to the hashmap with index 0.
3. The second number is 7. The complement of 7 in the target is 2. 2 is in the hashmap. So, return [0, hashmap[2]] = [0, 0].
Therefore, `twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)` will return: [0, 0]

1. isValid("()") checks if the string of parentheses is valid.
2. The first character is "(". It is not in the mapping, so append it to the stack.
3. The second character is ")". It is in the mapping, so pop the top element from the stack.
4. The top element is "(". The mapping of ")" is "(". They are the same, so continue.
5. The stack is empty, so return not stack = not [] = True.
