Let's execute the code step by step.
1. The function `f` takes a list of numbers as input.
2. It iterates over the list using a for loop.
3. For each number, it checks if the number is divisible by 3.
4. If the number is divisible by 3, it appends the number to the end of the list.
5. The function returns the modified list.
6. In the given input, the list is [1, 3, 3].
7. The first number 1 is not divisible by 3, so no appending happens.
8. The second number 3 is divisible by 3, so it gets appended to the end of the list.
9. The third number 3 is divisible by 3, so it gets appended to the end of the list.
10. The final list becomes [1, 3, 3, 3, 3].
