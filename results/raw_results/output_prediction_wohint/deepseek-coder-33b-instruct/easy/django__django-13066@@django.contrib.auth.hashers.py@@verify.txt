1. Inside `verify`, it calls: argon2.PasswordHasher().verify('$' + rest, password)
2. `argon2.PasswordHasher().verify` is a method from the argon2 library.
3. The encoded string is split into algorithm, rest. The rest is then passed to the verify method of the argon2 library.
4. The verify method of the argon2 library will return True if the password matches the encoded string, and False otherwise.
