[THOUGHT]
The function `median` computes the median of a list of numbers. Here's the step-by-step process for the input data [2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8]:

1. **Sort the data**: The input list `[2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8]` is sorted to `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.
2. **Determine length**: The sorted list has 7 elements (odd length).
3. **Calculate median for odd-length list**: 
   - For odd-length lists, the median is the middle element. 
   - The middle index is `n // 2 = 7 // 2 = 3` (0-based indexing).
   - The element at index 3 in the sorted list is `5`.
4. **No rounding for odd-length**: The code only rounds the result for even-length lists. Since the length is odd, the value `5` is returned directly.

Thus, the output is `5`.
