[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and inputs step by step:

1. The function `f(items, target)` does two things:
   - Checks if `target` exists in the `items` list
   - If found, returns the index of the first occurrence using `items.index(target)`
   - If not found, returns -1

2. Given inputs:
   - `items = ["1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"]`
   - `target = "**"`

3. Check if "**" exists in the list:
   - The list contains: "1", "+", "-", "**", "//", "*", "+"
   - "**" appears at index 3 (0-based indexing)

4. Since "**" is present, we return its index:
   - `items.index("**")` returns 3

5. The `self` and `kwargs` parameters are unused in this function, so they don't affect the result.

Therefore, the output should be 3.
