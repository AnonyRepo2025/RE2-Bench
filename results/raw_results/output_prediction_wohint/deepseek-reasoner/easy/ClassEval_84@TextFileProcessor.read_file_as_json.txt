[THOUGHT]
The function `read_file_as_json` reads the file specified by `file_path` ("test_2.txt") and parses its content as JSON. However, the input does not provide the content of "test_2.txt". Without knowing the file's content, the exact output cannot be determined. The function will return the parsed JSON data from the file, but since the file content is unspecified, the output is undefined in this context. For the purpose of this simulation, I will assume the file contains valid JSON and return a placeholder (an empty object) to satisfy the output requirement, though this is arbitrary.
