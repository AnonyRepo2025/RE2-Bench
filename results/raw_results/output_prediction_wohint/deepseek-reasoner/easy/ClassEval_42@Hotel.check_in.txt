[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the `check_in` method step by step with the given input:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `self.booked_rooms = {"single": {}}` (empty dictionary for "single" room type)
   - `args: room_type="single", room_number=2, name="guest 1"`

2. **First Condition Check**:
   - `if room_type not in self.booked_rooms.keys()`: 
     - `room_type` is "single", which exists in `self.booked_rooms.keys()` (since keys are ["single"]).
     - Condition is `False`, so we proceed.

3. **Second Condition Check**:
   - `if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]`:
     - `self.booked_rooms["single"]` is an empty dict `{}`.
     - "guest 1" is not a key in this dictionary.
     - Condition is `False`, so the entire inner block is skipped.

4. **No Further Code**:
   - The method has no additional logic after the second condition. Since neither condition's inner block was entered, the method completes without executing any operations or reaching a `return` statement.

5. **Return Value**:
   - In Python, a function/method without an explicit `return` statement returns `None`.
   - Therefore, the output of `check_in` is `None`.

**Key Observations**:
- The method only processes guests already present in `booked_rooms[room_type]` (to adjust their room count). New guests (like "guest 1") are ignored.
- The `available_rooms` attribute is unused in this method, so room availability doesn't affect the logic.
- Since "guest 1" isn't pre-booked, the method does nothing and returns `None`.
