The function `f` processes the input text by iterating over each character in the `characters` string. For each character at index `i`, it creates a substring by taking every `len(characters)`-th character starting from `i`, and then strips the text of any trailing characters that match this substring. 

Given:
- `text = "r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r"`
- `characters = "x.r"` (length = 3)

Steps:
1. **Iteration 1 (i=0):**  
   `characters[0::3]` → `"x"` (slicing starts at index 0, step 3: indices 0, 3, ... → only 'x' is present).  
   `text.rstrip('x')` → No trailing 'x' in `"r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r"`, so text remains unchanged: `"r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r"`.

2. **Iteration 2 (i=1):**  
   `characters[1::3]` → `"."` (slicing starts at index 1, step 3: only '.' is present).  
   `text.rstrip('.')` → No trailing '.' in `"r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r"`, so text remains: `"r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r"`.

3. **Iteration 3 (i=2):**  
   `characters[2::3]` → `"r"` (slicing starts at index 2, step 3: only 'r' is present).  
   `text.rstrip('r')` → Removes **all trailing 'r' characters**. The original text ends with a single 'r' (last character), so only the final 'r' is removed. The text becomes: `"r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;"`.

Final output: `"r;r;r;r;r;r;r;r;"` (8 'r's and 8 semicolons, ending with a semicolon).
