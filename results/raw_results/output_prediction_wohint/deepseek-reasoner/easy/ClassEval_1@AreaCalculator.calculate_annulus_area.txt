[THOUGHT]
The `AreaCalculator` class has an `__init__` method that sets `self.radius`, but the `calculate_annulus_area` method does not use `self.radius` at all. Instead, it directly uses the arguments `inner_radius` and `outer_radius` passed to it. 

Given the input:
- `inner_radius = 0`
- `outer_radius = 1`

The calculation is:
1. `outer_radius ** 2 = 1 ** 2 = 1`
2. `inner_radius ** 2 = 0 ** 2 = 0`
3. `outer_radius ** 2 - inner_radius ** 2 = 1 - 0 = 1`
4. `math.pi * 1 = math.pi` (approximately 3.141592653589793)

The value of `self.radius` (2000) is irrelevant since it's not used in the method. The output is solely determined by the provided arguments.
