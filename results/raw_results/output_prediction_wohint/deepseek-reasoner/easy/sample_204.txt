[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `f(name)` takes a single argument `name`, which in this case is the string "master. " (including a space at the end).
2. The function returns a list with two elements:
   - First element: `name[0]` → the first character of the string.
     - For "master. ", index 0 is 'm'.
   - Second element: `name[1][::-1][0]` → let's break this down:
     - `name[1]` extracts the character at index 1, which is 'a'.
     - `[::-1]` reverses this substring. Since it's a single character ('a'), reversing gives 'a'.
     - `[0]` takes the first character of this reversed substring, which is 'a'.
3. Therefore, the function returns `['m', 'a']`.

The input string "master. " has these characters:
- Index 0: 'm'
- Index 1: 'a'
- Remaining characters don't affect the result since only indices 0 and 1 are used.

Final output: `['m', 'a']`
