[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` uses the string method `ljust()` to left-justify the input text. The method takes two arguments: the total width of the resulting string and the fill character (default is space). Here, the width is set to `len(text) + 1`, and the fill character is `#`. 

Given the input text is "the cow goes moo":
1. Calculate the length of the text: "the cow goes moo" has 16 characters (including spaces).
2. The width for `ljust()` is `16 + 1 = 17`.
3. Since the current length (16) is less than the specified width (17), one `#` is appended to the end of the string to make the total length 17.
4. The result is "the cow goes moo#".

Thus, the function returns the string with an additional `#` at the end.
