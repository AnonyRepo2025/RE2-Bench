The `list_employees` method processes the `employees` dictionary stored in the class instance. Here's the step-by-step execution:

1. Initialize an empty `employee_data` dictionary.
2. Check if `self.employees` is non-empty (it contains one employee with ID "1").
3. Iterate over `self.employees`:
   - Current employee ID: `"1"`
   - Current employee info: `{"name": "John", "position": "Manager", "department": "Sales", "salary": 100000}`
4. Create `employee_details` dictionary:
   - Add `'employee_ID': '1'` (from the loop key)
   - Iterate through employee info keys:
     * `name: "John"` → add to details
     * `position: "Manager"` → add to details
     * `department: "Sales"` → add to details
     * `salary: 100000` → add to details
5. Add the constructed `employee_details` to `employee_data` with key `"1"`.
6. Return `employee_data` containing the formatted employee record.

The output will be a dictionary with employee ID as the key, and a merged dictionary containing both the original details plus the added `employee_ID` field.
