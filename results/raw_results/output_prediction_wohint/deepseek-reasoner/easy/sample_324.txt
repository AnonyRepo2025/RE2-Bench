[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function step by step with the given input:

1. The input is `nums = []` (an empty list).
2. `asc = nums.copy()` creates a copy of the empty list, so `asc = []`.
3. `asc.reverse()` reverses the list in place. Since the list is empty, reversing it has no effect. `asc` remains `[]`.
4. `desc = asc[:len(asc) // 2]`:
   - `len(asc)` is 0.
   - `len(asc) // 2` is 0 (integer division).
   - `asc[:0]` is an empty slice, so `desc = []`.
5. The return statement is `desc + asc + desc`:
   - This concatenates three empty lists: `[] + [] + []`.
   - The result is an empty list `[]`.

Therefore, the output is an empty list.
