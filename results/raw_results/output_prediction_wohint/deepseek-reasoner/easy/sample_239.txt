[THOUGHT]
The function `f` performs left and right stripping of characters specified in `froms` from the input `text`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial input values**:
   - `text = "0 t 1cos "` (note the trailing space)
   - `froms = "st 0\t\n  "` (characters: 's', 't', space, '0', tab, newline, and two spaces)

2. **Left strip (`lstrip`)**:
   - Removes leading characters present in `froms` until a non-matching character is found.
   - Breakdown:
     - First character '0' is in `froms` → remove → text becomes " t 1cos "
     - Next character space is in `froms` → remove → text becomes "t 1cos "
     - Next character 't' is in `froms` → remove → text becomes " 1cos "
     - Next character space is in `froms` → remove → text becomes "1cos "
     - Next character '1' is **not** in `froms` → stop stripping.
   - Result after `lstrip`: `"1cos "` (trailing space remains).

3. **Right strip (`rstrip`)**:
   - Removes trailing characters present in `froms` until a non-matching character is found.
   - Starting from `"1cos "`:
     - Last character space is in `froms` → remove → text becomes "1cos"
     - New last character 's' is in `froms` → remove → text becomes "1co"
     - New last character 'o' is **not** in `froms` → stop stripping.
   - Result after `rstrip`: `"1co"`.

4. **Final output**: The function returns `"1co"`.
