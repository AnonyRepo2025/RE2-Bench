[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `chars`. The logic is as follows:
1. If `chars` is non-empty, remove trailing characters from `text` that are in `chars` using `rstrip(chars)`.
2. If `chars` is empty, remove trailing spaces from `text` using `rstrip(' ')`.
3. If the resulting text is an empty string, return '-'.
4. Otherwise, return the modified text.

Given inputs:
- `text`: "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.2"
- `chars`: "0123456789-"

Step-by-step execution:
- Since `chars` is non-empty ("0123456789-"), we perform `text.rstrip(chars)`.
- The string ends with "2.2". The `rstrip` removes trailing characters in `chars` (digits or hyphens) from the right until a character not in `chars` is encountered.
- The last character '2' (digit) is removed, leaving "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2." (the '.' is not in `chars`, so removal stops).
- The resulting text is not empty, so it is returned.

Thus, the output is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.".
