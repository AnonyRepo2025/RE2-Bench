[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` uses the string method `isascii()`, which returns `True` if all characters in the string are ASCII characters (Unicode code points in the range U+0000 to U+007F), and `False` otherwise.

Given the input string: `"wW\uc758IV]HDJjhgK[dGIUlVO@Ess$coZkBqu[Ct"`

1. The string contains the character `\uc758`, which is the Unicode character 'Ïùò' (Hangul syllable). Its Unicode code point is U+C758 (51029 in decimal), which is outside the ASCII range (0-127).
2. Since at least one character (U+C758) is non-ASCII, `text.isascii()` will return `False`.

Thus, the output is `False`.
