[THOUGHT]
The `set_target_temperature` method updates the `target_temperature` attribute of the Thermostat instance but does not return any value. Therefore, the output of the method call is `None`.

Steps:
1. The method accepts a `temperature` argument (10 in this case).
2. It sets `self.target_temperature = temperature`, updating the instance's state.
3. Since there is no `return` statement, the method implicitly returns `None`.

The method does not produce any output value beyond modifying internal state, so the function output is `None`.
