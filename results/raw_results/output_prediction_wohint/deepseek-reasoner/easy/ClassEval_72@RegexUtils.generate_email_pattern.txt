[THOUGHT]
The function `generate_email_pattern` returns a regex pattern string for matching email addresses. The pattern is defined as:
```python
pattern = '\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'
```
Since the input has no arguments (`args` and `kwargs` are empty), calling this method will simply return the pre-defined pattern string. The pattern includes escaped backslashes (`\\`) which represent literal backslashes in the regex, and the character classes are explicitly defined. The output will be this exact string.
