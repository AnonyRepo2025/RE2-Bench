[THOUGHT]
The function `f(s1, s2)` counts occurrences of substring `s2` in `s1` starting from position 1 (index 1) and onward. It initializes `position = 1` and `count = 0`. The loop runs while `position > 0`. In each iteration:
1. `position = s1.find(s2, position)` searches for `s2` starting from `position`.
2. `count` is incremented by 1, regardless of whether a match is found.
3. `position` is incremented by 1.

For `s1 = "xinyyexyxx"` and `s2 = "xx"`:
- Start with `position = 1`, `count = 0`.
- First `find`: Search for "xx" starting at index 1. The substring "xx" appears at index 8. So `position = 8`, then `count = 1`, and `position` becomes 9.
- Second `find`: Search for "xx" starting at index 9. No occurrence is found, so `position = -1`. Then `count = 2`, and `position` becomes `-1 + 1 = 0`.
- Loop condition `position > 0` fails, so exit.
- Return `count = 2`.

The function counts the actual occurrence at index 8 and the failed search afterward, resulting in a return value of 2.
