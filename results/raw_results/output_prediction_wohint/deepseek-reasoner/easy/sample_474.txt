The function `f(txt, marker)` processes the input text as follows:
1. Split `txt` into lines using `split('\n')`, resulting in a list of strings.
2. For each line, apply `line.center(marker)` to center the line within a field of width `marker`.
3. Join the processed lines back with newline characters.

Given inputs:
- `txt = "#[)[]>[^e>\n 8"` (which splits into two lines: `"#[)[]>[^e>"` and `" 8"`)
- `marker = -5`

Key behavior of `str.center(width)` in Python:
- If `width` is less than or equal to the length of the string, the original string is returned unchanged.
- Since `marker = -5` (negative) is always less than the length of any non-empty string, both lines will be returned as-is.

Step-by-step execution:
1. Split `txt` into lines: 
   - Line 1: `"#[)[]>[^e>"` (length = 10)
   - Line 2: `" 8"` (length = 2)
2. Process each line with `center(-5)`:
   - `"#[)[]>[^e>".center(-5)` → returns `"#[)[]>[^e>"` (unchanged)
   - `" 8".center(-5)` → returns `" 8"` (unchanged)
3. Join the lines: `"#[)[]>[^e>" + "\n" + " 8"` → `"#[)[]>[^e>\n 8"`

Thus, the output is identical to the input string because the negative `marker` value prevents any centering.
