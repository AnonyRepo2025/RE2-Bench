[THOUGHT]
The `update_product_quantity` method updates the quantity of a product in the inventory if the product_id exists. The input shows:
- `self.inventory` has a product with key "1" (string)
- `args` provides `product_id=1` (integer) and `quantity=-1`
Since the method checks `if product_id in self.inventory`, and the keys in `self.inventory` are strings while `product_id` is an integer, the condition fails (1 â‰  "1"). Thus, no update occurs. The method has no return statement, so it returns `None`.
