[THOUGHT]
The `stop` method in the MusicPlayer class checks if `self.current_song` is not None. If true, it sets `self.current_song` to None and returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. Given the input state:
- `self.current_song` is "song1" (non-None)
The condition is met, so `self.current_song` is set to None, and the method returns True. The output is the boolean value True.
