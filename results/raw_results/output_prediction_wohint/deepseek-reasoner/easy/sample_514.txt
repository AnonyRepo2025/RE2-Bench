[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` processes the input string by:
1. Splitting the text into tokens using space as the delimiter.
2. For each token, it replaces occurrences of:
   - A hyphen followed by the token (pattern: `-{token}`)
   - The token followed by a hyphen (pattern: `{token}-`)
   with a space.
3. After processing all tokens, it strips leading and trailing hyphens from the resulting string.

Given input: `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`
- Tokens from split: `['-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-']`

Processing each token:
1. For token `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in'`:
   - Pattern `-{token}` = `'--stew---corn-and-beans-in'` → not found in text (text starts with single `-`).
   - Pattern `{token}-` = `'-stew---corn-and-beans-in-'` → not found (token ends with `in`, followed by space).
   - No changes to text.

2. For token `'soup-.-'`:
   - Pattern `-{token}` = `'-soup-.-'` → not found (`soup` is preceded by space, not `-`).
   - Pattern `{token}-` = `'soup-.-.-'` → not found (token is at end of string).
   - No changes to text.

After processing, text remains: `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`

Final step: `text.strip('-')`
- Removes leading `-` → `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`
- Removes trailing `-` (last character) → `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."`
- Result: `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."`
