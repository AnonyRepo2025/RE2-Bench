[THOUGHT]
The `set_city` method is defined as:
```python
def set_city(self, city):
    self.city = city
```
This method updates the `city` attribute of the object to the new value passed as an argument. It does not return any value (i.e., returns `None`).

Given the input:
- Current state: `city` is "New York"
- Method argument: `city` is "Beijing"

After calling `set_city("Beijing")`:
1. The `self.city` attribute will be updated from "New York" to "Beijing"
2. The method has no return statement, so it returns `None`

Therefore, the output is `None`.
