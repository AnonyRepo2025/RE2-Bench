[THOUGHT]
The input provides the state of the `TimeUtils` instance with `datetime` set to the string `"2025-08-25 16:37:34.963631"`. However, the `get_current_date` method expects `self.datetime` to be a `datetime.datetime` object (as initialized in `__init__`). Since the input provides a string instead of a datetime object, calling `strftime` on it would normally raise an `AttributeError`. 

But note the problem context: The input JSON represents the state, and the value `"2025-08-25 16:37:34.963631"` is meant to describe a datetime object. For the purpose of this simulation, we interpret this string as representing a datetime object with the corresponding value. Thus, when `strftime('%Y-%m-%d')` is called, it formats the date part as `"2025-08-25"`.

Reasoning:
1. The method uses `strftime('%Y-%m-%d')` to format the date.
2. The year is `2025`, month is `08`, and day is `25` (from the input string).
3. The output is the formatted date string: `"2025-08-25"`.
