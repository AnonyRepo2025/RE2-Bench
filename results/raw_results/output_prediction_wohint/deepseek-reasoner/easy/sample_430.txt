[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes two arguments: `arr1` and `arr2`. Here's what it does step by step:
1. `new_arr = arr1.copy()`: Creates a shallow copy of `arr1`. For the input, `arr1` is `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]`, so `new_arr` becomes a new list `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8]`.
2. `new_arr.extend(arr2)`: Extends `new_arr` by appending all elements from `arr2`. The input `arr2` is `["", 0, -1, []]`, so these elements are added to the end of `new_arr`.
3. The extended list becomes: `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.
4. This list is returned as the output.

The function does not modify the original `arr1` or `arr2` since it works on a copy. The output is a single list combining both arrays.
