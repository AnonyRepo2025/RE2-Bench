[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the execution of the function `f(n, m, text)` with the given inputs:
- `n = "x"`
- `m = "$"`
- `text = "2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"`

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Check for empty text**:  
   `text.strip()` is called. The original text `"2xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"` has no leading/trailing whitespace, so `text.strip()` returns the same string. Since it's not empty, we proceed.

2. **Split the text into head, mid, and tail**:  
   - `head = text[0]` → First character: `"2"`  
   - `tail = text[-1]` → Last character: `"s"`  
   - `mid = text[1:-1]` → Substring from index 1 to the second-to-last character: `"xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri"`  
   (Original text: `"2 x z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri s"` → head=`"2"`, mid=`"xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri"`, tail=`"s"`)

3. **Replace `n` with `m` in each part**:  
   - `head.replace("x", "$")` → `"2"` (no `"x"` to replace) → remains `"2"`  
   - `mid.replace("x", "$")` → `"xz&5H3*1a@#a*1hri"` becomes `"$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri"` (the `"x"` at position 0 of `mid` is replaced)  
   - `tail.replace("x", "$")` → `"s"` (no `"x"` to replace) → remains `"s"`  

4. **Concatenate the parts**:  
   `joined = "2" + "$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hri" + "s" = "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"`  

5. **Return the result**:  
   The function returns `"2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"`.

Key observations:  
- Only the `"x"` in the `mid` portion (originally the second character of the input string) is replaced with `"$"`.  
- No other characters are modified since `n="x"` only targets `"x"`.  
- The splitting and replacement are done per segment (head, mid, tail), but since `head` and `tail` are single characters, replacement in them only occurs if they match `"x"` (which they don't in this case).  

Thus, the output string is `"2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris"`.
