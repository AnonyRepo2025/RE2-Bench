The function `f` counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring `part` in the string `full`. It works by repeatedly finding the next occurrence of `part`, removing the prefix up to and including that occurrence, and incrementing a counter until no more occurrences are found.

Given:
- `full = "hrsiajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy"`
- `part = "hr"`

Step-by-step execution:
1. `length = len("hr") = 2`
2. First occurrence: `index = full.find("hr")` → found at position 0.
   - Update `full = full[0 + 2:] = full[2:] = "siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy"`
   - `count = 1`
3. Second occurrence: `index = full.find("hr")` → in "siajiajieihruejfhbrisvlmmy", "hr" starts at index 10 (characters 'h' at index 10, 'r' at index 11).
   - Update `full = full[10 + 2:] = full[12:] = "uejfhbrisvlmmy"`
   - `count = 2`
4. Third occurrence: `index = full.find("hr")` → in "uejfhbrisvlmmy", no contiguous "hr" exists (e.g., 'h' at index 4 is followed by 'b', not 'r').
   - `index = -1`, loop exits.
5. Return `count = 2`

Thus, the output is 2.
