[THOUGHT]
The function `eat` takes three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. The logic is:
- If `need` is less than or equal to `remaining`, it returns a list containing `number + need` and `remaining - need`.
- Otherwise, it returns a list containing `number + remaining` and `0`.

Given the input values:
- `number` = 4
- `need` = 8
- `remaining` = 9

Check the condition: `need` (8) <= `remaining` (9) is true. Therefore:
- Compute `number + need` = 4 + 8 = 12
- Compute `remaining - need` = 9 - 8 = 1
- Return the list [12, 1]

The output will be a list with these two values.
