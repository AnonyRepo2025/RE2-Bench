[THOUGHT]
The `extract_file` method attempts to extract a specific file from a zip archive. Given the inputs:
- `self.file_name = "example.zip"`
- `file_name = "example5.txt"`
- `output_path = "output_directory"`

The method uses a try-except block:
1. It tries to open "example.zip" and extract "example5.txt" to "output_directory".
2. If any error occurs (e.g., "example.zip" doesn't exist, "example5.txt" isn't in the archive, or "output_directory" is invalid), it returns `False`.
3. If successful, it returns `True`.

Since the input doesn't provide the state of the filesystem (existence of "example.zip" or "example5.txt"), we must consider common failure scenarios:
- The zip file "example.zip" likely doesn't exist in the current context (as no file data is provided).
- Even if it exists, "example5.txt" might not be in the archive.

The try-except catches any exception, and without explicit confirmation of the files' existence, the operation will fail, returning `False`.
