[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function `f` step by step with the given inputs:

1. The function `f` takes two arguments: `list` (which is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`) and `operation` (which is a lambda function `lambda x: x.reverse()`).

2. The first line inside the function creates a shallow copy of the input list:  
   `new_list = list[:]` → `new_list = [6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`

3. The next line sorts `new_list` in ascending order:  
   `new_list.sort()` → `new_list` becomes `[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`

4. The `operation` is applied to `new_list`:  
   `operation(new_list)` executes `lambda x: x.reverse()`, which reverses `new_list` in place.  
   After reversal, `new_list` becomes `[15, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.

5. The function returns the original `list` (which was never modified):  
   `return list` → returns `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.

Key observations:  
- The original list (`list`) is not modified because `new_list` is a separate copy.  
- The `operation` (reverse) is applied only to the sorted copy (`new_list`), leaving the original list unchanged.  
- The lambda function `lambda x: x.reverse()` performs an in-place reversal and returns `None`, but this return value is ignored.

Thus, the output is the original input list: `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
