[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a string `text` and performs three main operations:
1. Sets the global variable `field` to `text` with all spaces removed.
2. Sets the global variable `g` to `text` with all '0's replaced by spaces.
3. Replaces all '1's in `text` with 'i' and returns this modified string.

Given the input text: "00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110"

Step-by-step execution:
- The original `text` is "00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110".
- `field` is set to `text.replace(' ', '')`, which removes all spaces: "0000000000000000011011000110010101101110".
- `g` is set to `text.replace('0', ' ')`, which replaces every '0' with a space (leaving existing spaces and '1's unchanged). This results in a string with many spaces and the '1's preserved.
- Finally, `text` is modified by replacing every '1' with 'i', while '0's and spaces remain unchanged. The groups become:
  - "00000000" → remains "00000000" (no '1's)
  - "00000000" → remains "00000000" (no '1's)
  - "01101100" → becomes "0ii0ii00"
  - "01100101" → becomes "0ii00i0i"
  - "01101110" → becomes "0ii0iii0"

The function returns the modified `text`: "00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0i 0ii0iii0".

Note: The global variables `field` and `g` are modified, but the function's output is the return value (the modified `text`).
