[THOUGHT]
We are to simulate the `__delitem__` method of the `CamelCaseMap` class with the given input. The input shows:
- `self._data` is an empty dictionary `{}`
- The `key` argument is `"first_name"`

Steps:
1. `__delitem__` calls `self._convert_key(key)` to process the key.
2. `_convert_key` checks if the key is a string. Since `"first_name"` is a string, it calls `_to_camel_case("first_name")`.
3. `_to_camel_case` splits the key by underscores: `["first", "name"]`.
4. The first part `"first"` is kept as-is. The remaining parts are title-cased: `"name"` becomes `"Name"`.
5. These are concatenated: `"first" + "Name" = "firstName"`.
6. `__delitem__` then attempts to delete `self._data["firstName"]`.
7. However, `self._data` is empty (as per input), so the key `"firstName"` does not exist.
8. This raises a `KeyError: 'firstName'`.

Since the method raises an exception and does not return a value, the output of the function call is this exception. We represent it as a string in the output.
