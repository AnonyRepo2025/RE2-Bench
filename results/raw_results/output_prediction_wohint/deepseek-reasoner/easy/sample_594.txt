[THOUGHT]
The function `f(file)` returns the index of the first occurrence of the newline character `'\n'` in the string `file`. 

Given input string: `"n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n.\n"`
- The string ends with a newline character `\n`.
- The part before `\n` is `"n wez szize lnson tilebi it 504n."`, which has 33 characters (including spaces and punctuation).
- Since Python uses 0-based indexing, the newline character `\n` is at position 33.

Thus, `file.index('\n')` returns `33`.
