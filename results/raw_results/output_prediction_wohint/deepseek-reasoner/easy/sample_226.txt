The function `f` takes a list `nums` and iterates over its indices. For each element at index `i`, if the element is divisible by 3, it appends that element to the end of the list. The loop runs only for the initial length of the list, as `range(len(nums))` is evaluated once at the start.

Given input `nums = [1, 3, 3]`:
1. **Initial list**: `[1, 3, 3]` (length = 3).
2. **Iteration 1 (i=0)**:
   - `nums[0] = 1` → `1 % 3 = 1` (not divisible by 3) → no change.
3. **Iteration 2 (i=1)**:
   - `nums[1] = 3` → `3 % 3 = 0` (divisible by 3) → append `3` to list.
   - List becomes `[1, 3, 3, 3]`.
4. **Iteration 3 (i=2)**:
   - `nums[2] = 3` (original third element) → `3 % 3 = 0` → append `3`.
   - List becomes `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
5. Loop ends after 3 iterations (initial length). The modified list `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is returned.

Thus, the output is `[1, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
