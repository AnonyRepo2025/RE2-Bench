[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `suffix`. It checks if `suffix` is non-empty and if `text` ends with `suffix`. If both conditions are true, it returns `text` without the suffix; otherwise, it returns `text` unchanged.

Given inputs:
- `text = "mathematics"`
- `suffix = "example"`

1. Check if `suffix` is non-empty: `"example"` is not empty → condition passes.
2. Check if `text` ends with `suffix`: Does `"mathematics"` end with `"example"`? 
   - The last 7 characters of `"mathematics"` are `"ematics"` (since `"example"` is 7 characters long).
   - `"ematics"` ≠ `"example"` → condition fails.

Since the `if` condition fails, the function returns the original `text` (`"mathematics"`).
