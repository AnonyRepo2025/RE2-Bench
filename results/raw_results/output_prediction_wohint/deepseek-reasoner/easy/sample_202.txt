[THOUGHT]
Let's simulate the function step by step with the given inputs:

1. **Initial state:**
   - `array` = [2, 15, 15, 1]
   - `list` = [15, 1]

2. **Execute `array.extend(list)`:**  
   This modifies `array` in-place by appending all elements from `list`.  
   New `array` becomes: [2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1]

3. **Evaluate list comprehension `[e for e in array if e % 2 == 0]`:**  
   This creates a temporary list of even numbers:  
   - Elements: 2 (even), 15 (odd), 15 (odd), 1 (odd), 15 (odd), 1 (odd)  
   - Result: [2]  
   *Note: This list is discarded since it's not stored or returned.*

4. **Return `[e for e in array if e >= 10]`:**  
   Filter elements ≥ 10 from the modified `array` ([2, 15, 15, 1, 15, 1]):  
   - 2 → skip (<10)  
   - 15 → include (≥10)  
   - 15 → include (≥10)  
   - 1 → skip (<10)  
   - 15 → include (≥10)  
   - 1 → skip (<10)  
   Final result: [15, 15, 15]

The output is a list of elements ≥ 10 after extending `array` with `list`.
