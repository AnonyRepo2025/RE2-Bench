Let's simulate the function step by step with the input list `a = [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`:

1. **Initialization**:  
   `b = a.copy()` â†’ `b = [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`

2. **Loop execution** (iterating over `k` in `range(0, len(a)-1, 2)`):  
   - `len(a) = 6`, so the range is `[0, 2, 4]` (stops before 5).  
   - **Iteration 1 (k=0)**:  
     Insert `b[0]` (value `5`) at index `k+1 = 1`:  
     `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`  
   - **Iteration 2 (k=2)**:  
     Insert `b[2]` (value `5`) at index `k+1 = 3`:  
     `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`  
   - **Iteration 3 (k=4)**:  
     Insert `b[4]` (value `5`) at index `k+1 = 5`:  
     `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9]`  

3. **Append operation**:  
   Append `b[0]` (value `5`) to the end:  
   `b` becomes `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9, 5]`  

4. **Return value**:  
   The final `b` is returned: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 9, 5]`  

**Key observations**:  
- The loop runs for every even index (0, 2, 4) in the original list (length 6).  
- Each insertion duplicates the element at position `k` and inserts it right after itself.  
- The initial `b[0]` is appended at the end.  
- The original list length was 6; after 3 insertions (adding 3 elements) and 1 append, the final length is 10.
