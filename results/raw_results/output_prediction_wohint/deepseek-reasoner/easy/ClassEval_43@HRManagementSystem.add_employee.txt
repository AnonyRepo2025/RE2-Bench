[THOUGHT]
The `add_employee` method checks if the given `employee_id` already exists in `self.employees`. If it does, it returns `False` (indicating failure to add). In this input, `self.employees` already contains an entry with key `"1"`, and the `employee_id` argument is `1`. Since the ID exists, the method will return `False` without modifying the dictionary.
