[THOUGHT]
The function `triangle_area` calculates the area of a triangle using the formula:  
**Area = (base Ã— height) / 2**.  
Given inputs:  
- `a` (base) = 10  
- `h` (height) = 8  

Step-by-step calculation:  
1. Multiply base (`a`) by height (`h`):  
   \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \)  
2. Divide the result by 2.0 (to ensure floating-point division):  
   \( 80 / 2.0 = 40.0 \)  

The output is a float value `40.0`.
