[THOUGHT]
The function `truncate_number` takes a float `number` and returns `number % 1.0`. The modulus operation `%` with `1.0` computes the fractional part of the number. For the input `3.5`:
- `3.5 % 1.0` equals `0.5` because 3.5 divided by 1.0 is 3 with a remainder of 0.5.
- The function returns this fractional part as a float.

Thus, for the input `number = 3.5`, the output is `0.5`.
