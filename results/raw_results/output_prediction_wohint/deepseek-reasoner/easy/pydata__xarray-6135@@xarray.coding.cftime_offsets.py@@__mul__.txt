The `__mul__` method of the `QuarterOffset` class is defined to handle multiplication. The method first checks if the `other` operand is a float. If it is, the method returns `NotImplemented`. In the provided input, `other` is `2.5`, which is a float. Therefore, the method returns `NotImplemented`.

[THOUGHT]
- The `__mul__` method checks `isinstance(other, float)`, which is `True` for `other=2.5`.
- The condition triggers the return of `NotImplemented`.
- No further code is executed beyond this condition.
- The output is the built-in constant `NotImplemented`, represented as a string in JSON.
