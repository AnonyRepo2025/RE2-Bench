[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text, use)` replaces every occurrence of the string `use` in `text` with an empty string, effectively removing all instances of `use`. 

Given:
- `text = "Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday."`
- `use = "a"`

We need to remove every occurrence of the substring "a" (case-sensitive) from the text. 

Step-by-step removal:
1. The standalone word "a" between spaces is removed, leaving two consecutive spaces ("requires a ride" â†’ "requires  ride").
2. The "a" in "airport" is removed, changing it to "irport".
3. The "a" in "Friday" is removed, changing it to "Fridy".
4. All other characters remain unchanged, including the period at the end.

Resulting string:
- "Chris requires  ride to the irport on Fridy."

Note: The function does not collapse multiple spaces or alter other punctuation.
