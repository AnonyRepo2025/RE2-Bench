[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function `f` step by step with the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:

1. **Create a copy of the array**:  
   `result = array.copy()` → `result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
   This creates a new list identical to the input to avoid modifying the original.

2. **Reverse the copied list in-place**:  
   `result.reverse()` → Reverses the order of elements:  
   Original: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` → Reversed: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

3. **Double each element and assign back to `result`**:  
   `result[:] = [item * 2 for item in result]`  
   - The list comprehension iterates over the reversed list `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` and doubles each value:  
     `5*2 = 10`, `4*2 = 8`, `3*2 = 6`, `2*2 = 4`, `1*2 = 2` → New list: `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`  
   - The slice assignment `result[:]` replaces all elements of `result` with this new list.  
   Final `result` becomes `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.

4. **Return the result**:  
   The function returns `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.

Thus, the output is a list where:  
- The original array was reversed, then each element was doubled.  
- The order is reversed from the input, and values are doubled.
