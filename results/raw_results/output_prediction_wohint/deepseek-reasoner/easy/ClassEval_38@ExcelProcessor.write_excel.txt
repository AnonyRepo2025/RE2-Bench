[THOUGHT]
The `write_excel` method writes data to an Excel file and returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.  
Given input:  
- `data` is a valid list of lists with mixed types (strings and integers)  
- `file_name` is a string  
- No errors are expected since:  
  1. Data structure is correct for `openpyxl`'s `append()`  
  2. File operations should succeed in a standard environment  
- The try block will execute without exceptions â†’ returns 1
