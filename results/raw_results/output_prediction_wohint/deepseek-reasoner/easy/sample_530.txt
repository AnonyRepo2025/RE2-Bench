[THOUGHT]
Let's execute the function `f(s, ch)` step by step with the given inputs:
- `s = "@@@ff"`
- `ch = "@"`

1. **Initialization**: `sl = s` → `sl = "@@@ff"`
2. **Check if `ch` is in `s`**: `"@"` is present in `"@@@ff"`, so enter the `if` block.
3. **Strip leading `ch` characters**:  
   `sl = s.lstrip(ch)` → `"@@@ff".lstrip("@")` removes all leading "@" characters, resulting in `"ff"`.
4. **Check if `sl` is empty**:  
   `len("ff")` is 2 (not 0), so skip the `if len(sl)==0` block.
5. **Return `sl`**: The function returns `"ff"`.

The `else` block (returning `"no"`) is not triggered since `ch` was found in `s`.
