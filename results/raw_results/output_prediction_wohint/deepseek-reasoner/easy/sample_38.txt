Let's simulate the function `f` step by step with the input string "1oE-err bzz-bmm".

1. **Apply `.title()` to the string**:  
   The `title()` method capitalizes the first letter of every word. Words are defined as sequences of alphabetic characters separated by non-alphabetic characters.  
   - The string has two words separated by a space: "1oE-err" and "bzz-bmm".  
   - For "1oE-err":  
     - Groups of alphabetic characters: "oE" and "err".  
     - "oE" → First character 'o' becomes 'O', 'E' becomes lowercase 'e' → "Oe".  
     - "err" → First character 'e' becomes 'E', "rr" remains → "Err".  
     - Non-alphabetic characters ('1' and '-') remain unchanged.  
     - Result: "1Oe-Err".  
   - For "bzz-bmm":  
     - Groups: "bzz" and "bmm".  
     - "bzz" → 'b' becomes 'B', "zz" remains → "Bzz".  
     - "bmm" → 'b' becomes 'B', "mm" remains → "Bmm".  
     - Result: "Bzz-Bmm".  
   - Combined with space: "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm".  

2. **Apply `.replace(' ', '')`**:  
   This removes all spaces from the string.  
   - "1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm" → Remove the space between "1Oe-Err" and "Bzz-Bmm".  
   - Result: "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm".  

Final output: "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm".
