[THOUGHT]
The function `f` is defined to take two parameters: `array` and `elem`. It returns the result of `array.count(elem) + elem`. 

Given the input:
- `array` is `[1, 1, 1]`
- `elem` is `-2`

Step-by-step execution:
1. **Count occurrences of `elem` in `array`**:  
   `array.count(-2)` checks how many times `-2` appears in `[1, 1, 1]`. Since `-2` is not present, the count is `0`.
2. **Add `elem` to the count**:  
   `0 + (-2) = -2`.

Thus, the output is `-2`.
