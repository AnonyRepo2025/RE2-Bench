[THOUGHT]
The function `f` iterates over the list `nums` from the second-to-last element backward to the first element. For each element at index `i`, if the element is even, it removes that element from the list. The input list is `[5, 3, 3, 7]`. 

Step-by-step execution:
1. The loop starts at index `i = len(nums) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2` (second-to-last element).
   - Element at index 2 is `3` (odd). No removal.
2. Next, `i = 1` (step -1).
   - Element at index 1 is `3` (odd). No removal.
3. Next, `i = 0` (first element).
   - Element at index 0 is `5` (odd). No removal.

Since no elements are even, the list remains unchanged. The function returns the original list `[5, 3, 3, 7]`.
