[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` processes the input string "scala" as follows:
1. `ls = text[::-1]` reverses the string, so "scala" becomes "alacs".
2. `text2` is initialized as an empty string.
3. The loop `for i in range(len(ls) - 3, 0, -3)`:
   - `len(ls)` is 5, so `len(ls) - 3` is 2.
   - The range is `range(2, 0, -3)`, which produces only one value: `i = 2` (since 2 - 3 = -1, which is less than 0 and excluded).
   - For `i = 2`, `ls[i:i+3]` extracts the substring from index 2 to 5 (exclusive) of "alacs", which is "acs".
   - `'---'.join(ls[i:i+3])` joins the characters with "---", resulting in "a---c---s".
   - This is appended to `text2` followed by "---", making `text2 = "a---c---s---"`.
4. The function returns `text2[:-3]`, which removes the last three characters (the trailing "---"), resulting in "a---c---s".

Thus, the output is "a---c---s".
