[THOUGHT]
The function `_validate_phoneNumber` is called with `phoneNumber = "jgdjrj"`.  
1. First, it checks if `phoneNumber` is empty: `"jgdjrj"` is not empty, so it proceeds.  
2. Next, it checks if the length is 11 and if all characters are digits:  
   - Length of `"jgdjrj"` is 6 (not 11).  
   - It contains letters 'j', 'g', 'd', 'r' (not digits).  
3. Since both conditions fail, the function returns `None`.  
The `name` and `sex` attributes of `self` are irrelevant for this method.
