[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `f` takes a list `nums` as input.
2. The first operation is `nums.clear()`, which removes all elements from the list. After this, `nums` becomes an empty list `[]`.
3. Next, there's a loop: `for num in nums:`. Since `nums` is now empty, the loop body `nums.append(num * 2)` will never execute because there are no elements to iterate over.
4. The function then returns `nums`, which remains an empty list.

Given the input `{"nums": []}`, the initial list is already empty. After clearing it (which leaves it empty), and skipping the loop, the returned value is still an empty list.

Therefore, the output should be an empty list.
