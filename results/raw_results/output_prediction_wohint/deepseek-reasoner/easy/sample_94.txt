[THOUGHT]
The function `f(a, b)` uses dictionary unpacking to merge two dictionaries. The expression `{**a, **b}` combines key-value pairs from both dictionaries. If there are duplicate keys, values from `b` will overwrite those from `a`.

Given the input:
- `a = {"w": 5, "wi": 10}`
- `b = {"w": 3}`

Step-by-step execution:
1. Start with dictionary `a`: keys `"w"` (value 5) and `"wi"` (value 10).
2. Merge with dictionary `b`: key `"w"` (value 3). Since `"w"` already exists in `a`, the value from `b` (3) overwrites the value from `a` (5).
3. The key `"wi"` from `a` remains unchanged since it doesn't exist in `b`.
4. The resulting dictionary is `{"w": 3, "wi": 10}`.

Thus, the output is a dictionary with `"w"` set to 3 (from `b`) and `"wi"` set to 10 (from `a`).
