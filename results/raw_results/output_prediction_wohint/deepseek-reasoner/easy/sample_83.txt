[THOUGHT]
The function `f` processes the input text by:
1. Using `rpartition('0')` to split the text into three parts: the part before the last occurrence of '0', the '0' itself, and the part after.
2. For the input "qq0tt":
   - The last '0' is at index 2 (0-based), so:
     - `l[0]` (before) is "qq"
     - `l[1]` is '0'
     - `l[2]` (after) is "tt"
3. Since `l[2]` ("tt") is not empty, the function returns a string formatted as `len(l[0]):(l[2].find('0') + 1)`.
4. `len(l[0])` is the length of "qq", which is 2.
5. `l[2].find('0')` searches for '0' in "tt" and returns -1 (not found). Adding 1 gives 0.
6. The result is "2:0".
