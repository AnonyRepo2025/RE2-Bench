[THOUGHT]
The function `_mask_nc` processes non-commutative expressions. Given the input expression `x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n`, we assume:
- Symbols `n`, `m`, and `o` are non-commutative (common in such contexts).
- Symbol `x` is commutative (default assumption).

The function:
1. Traverses the expression to collect non-commutative symbols (`nc_syms`) and non-basic non-commutative objects (`nc_obj`).
2. Since the expression consists of `Add` and `Mul` operations (basic types), no objects are added to `nc_obj`.
3. Non-commutative symbols `n`, `m`, and `o` are collected in `nc_syms`.
4. Conditions for single replacement aren't met (3 symbols, not 1), so no substitutions occur.
5. Returns:
   - The original expression unchanged.
   - `rep` as `None` (no substitutions made).
   - `nc_syms` sorted by `default_sort_key` (alphabetical order: `['m', 'n', 'o']`).

The output expression remains `x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n` as a string.
