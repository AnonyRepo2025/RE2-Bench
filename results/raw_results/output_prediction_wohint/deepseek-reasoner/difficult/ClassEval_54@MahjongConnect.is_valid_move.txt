[THOUGHT]
The `is_valid_move` method checks four conditions for a valid move:
1. Both positions must be within the board boundaries
2. The positions cannot be identical
3. The tiles at both positions must have the same icon
4. There must be a clear path connecting the two tiles (using BFS)

Given input:
- `pos1 = (0, 0)` → tile 'a'
- `pos2 = (0, 1)` → tile 'b'

Step-by-step evaluation:
1. Boundary check: Both (0,0) and (0,1) are within the 4x4 board → Pass
2. Position equality: (0,0) ≠ (0,1) → Pass
3. Icon match: 'a' ≠ 'b' → Fail

Since the icon match fails, the method immediately returns `False` without checking the path. The output is `False`.
