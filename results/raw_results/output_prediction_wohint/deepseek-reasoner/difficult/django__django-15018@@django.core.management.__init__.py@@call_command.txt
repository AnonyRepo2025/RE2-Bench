[THOUGHT]
The task is to predict the output of `call_command` with the given input. The input specifies:
- `command_name`: "transaction"
- `kwargs`: `{"stdout": {}, "no_color": true}`

Step-by-step simulation:

1. **Resolve the command**:
   - `command_name` is a string ("transaction"), so we look it up in `get_commands()`.
   - `get_commands()` first checks if Django settings are configured. Since no settings are provided in the input, `settings.configured` is `False` (as `settings._wrapped` is likely unset). Thus, only built-in Django core commands are considered.
   - `find_commands()` searches `django/core/management/commands` for valid commands. "transaction" is a valid built-in command, so `app_name = "django.core"`.
   - `load_command_class("django.core", "transaction")` imports `django.core.management.commands.transaction` and returns an instance of its `Command` class.

2. **Create the parser**:
   - `command.create_parser("", "transaction")` is called. This initializes a `CommandParser` and adds base arguments (like `--verbosity`, `--no-color`, etc.).
   - The `Command` instance is initialized with `stdout` and `no_color` from kwargs. `no_color=True` disables output coloring.

3. **Build option mapping**:
   - `opt_mapping` is created by processing parser actions. For `--no-color`, the key is "no_color" (min option string "--no-color" → strip dashes → replace hyphens → "no_color"), mapping to destination "no_color".
   - `arg_options` is built from kwargs: `{"stdout": {}, "no_color": true}` → `{"stdout": {}, "no_color": true}` (since "stdout" isn't in `opt_mapping`, it remains unchanged).

4. **Parse arguments**:
   - `parse_args` is an empty list (no positional args in input).
   - `parser.parse_args([])` returns defaults: `verbosity=1`, `no_color=False`, etc.
   - `defaults` combines parsed args and `arg_options`: `no_color` is overridden to `true`, and `stdout={}` is included.

5. **Handle special options**:
   - `skip_checks` is added to `defaults` as `true` (since it's not in the original `kwargs`).
   - `args` is extracted from `defaults` as an empty tuple.

6. **Execute the command**:
   - `command.execute(*args, **defaults)` is called with:
     - `*args`: `()`
     - `**defaults`: Includes `stdout={}`, `no_color=true`, `skip_checks=true`, and other base options.
   - The "transaction" command requires at least one positional argument (an app label). Since none is provided, it raises a `CommandError` for missing arguments.

**Conclusion**: The function raises a `CommandError` due to missing required arguments. Since the problem asks for output, and an exception is raised, there is no successful return value. The output is `null` to indicate no return.
