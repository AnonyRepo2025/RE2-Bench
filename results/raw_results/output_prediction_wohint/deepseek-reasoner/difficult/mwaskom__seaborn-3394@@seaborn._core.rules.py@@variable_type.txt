[THOUGHT]
The function `variable_type` determines the type of a pandas Series. Given the input:

1. The `vector` argument represents a pandas Series. The provided structure has an empty block and no data, indicating an **empty Series**.
2. The first condition checks for a categorical dtype. Since the dtype isn't specified and the Series is empty, this condition fails.
3. The second condition checks if all values are NaN. For an empty Series, `pd.isna(vector).all()` returns `True` because an empty Series has no elements to violate the condition.
4. The function immediately returns `VarType('numeric')` at this step, as the "all NaN" condition is satisfied. Subsequent checks (for boolean, numeric, or datetime types) are not executed.

The `boolean_type` argument ('boolean') is irrelevant here because the function exits early. The output is `VarType('numeric')`, which we represent as the type string 'numeric' in a JSON object.
