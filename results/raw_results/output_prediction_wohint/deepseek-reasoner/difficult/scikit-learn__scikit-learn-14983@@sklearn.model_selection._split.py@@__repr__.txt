[THOUGHT]
The task is to predict the output of the `__repr__` method for the given input. The `__repr__` method calls `_build_repr(self)`, which is not explicitly defined in the provided code. However, based on common practices in scikit-learn (where this code originates), `_build_repr` typically generates a string representation of the object by including its class name and key parameters.

Given the input:
- `self` has attributes `test_fold` (value `"[1 1 2 2]"`) and `unique_folds` (value `"[1 2]"`).
- The class name is not provided in the input, but `PredefinedSplit` is a subclass of `BaseCrossValidator` (listed in `__all__`) and uses `test_fold` as a parameter.

Steps:
1. `__repr__` calls `_build_repr(self)`, which formats the object's representation.
2. `_build_repr` uses the object's class name (`PredefinedSplit` is inferred since it matches the attributes).
3. It includes parameters from `get_params()` (not shown, but typically includes `test_fold` for `PredefinedSplit`).
4. The value of `test_fold` is the string `"[1 1 2 2]"`. However, in context, this likely represents an array. For accurate representation, it should be converted to a list: `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
5. `unique_folds` is likely an internal attribute and not included in the representation.
6. The output should be a string: `PredefinedSplit(test_fold=[1, 1, 2, 2])`.

Thus, the final representation is `PredefinedSplit(test_fold=[1, 1, 2, 2])`.
