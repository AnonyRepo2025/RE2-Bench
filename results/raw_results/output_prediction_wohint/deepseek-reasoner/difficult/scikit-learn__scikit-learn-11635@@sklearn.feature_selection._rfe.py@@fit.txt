[THOUGHT]
The provided input for the `fit` method includes an estimator object with only a `foo_param` attribute and no `fit` or `score` method. The `check_scoring` function, called early in `RFECV.fit`, requires the estimator to have a `fit` method. Since the input estimator lacks this method, a `TypeError` is raised during the `check_scoring` call. This occurs before any attributes (like `support_`, `n_features_`, etc.) are set. Therefore, the function terminates early, and no output attributes are initialized or populated. The output should reflect this error state.

  "error": "TypeError: estimator should be an estimator implementing 'fit' method, the provided estimator does not have a 'fit' method."
