The function `exptrigsimp` is designed to simplify expressions involving exponential and trigonometric functions. The input expression is `(1 + exp(2))/(y*(-1 + exp(2))`, which can be rewritten as `(1 + exp(2))/(y*(exp(2) - 1))` due to the commutativity of addition.

### Step-by-step execution:
1. **Initial expression**: `(1 + exp(2))/(y*(exp(2) - 1))`.
2. **Check for trigonometric/hyperbolic functions**: The expression contains `exp(2)`, which is an exponential function but not a trigonometric or hyperbolic function. Thus, no rewriting occurs in the initial `exp_trig` step.
3. **Apply `bottom_up` with `exp_trig`**: The function `exp_trig` considers rewriting options:
   - Original form: `(1 + exp(2))/(y*(exp(2) - 1))` (count: 7 operations).
   - Rewritten in terms of `exp`: Same as original.
   - Rewritten in terms of `cos`: Not applicable for real exponents, so same as original.
   The original form is retained as it has the fewest operations.
4. **Apply `bottom_up` with function `f`**:
   - The expression is a `Mul`: `(1 + exp(2)) * (y*(exp(2) - 1))**(-1)`.
   - The power dictionary is:
     - Base `1 + exp(2)`: exponent 1.
     - Base `y*(exp(2) - 1)`: exponent -1.
   - The function `f` attempts pattern matching:
     - For `1 + exp(2)` (an `Add` with two terms):
       - `c = 1`, `sign = 1`, `x = 2`.
       - Conditions for hyperbolic conversion (e.g., `cosh` or `sinh`) are not met.
     - The expression remains unchanged.
5. **Check for hyperbolic/trigonometric functions**: None present, so no further rewriting.
6. **Return the expression**: The output is the same as the input.

The expression is not simplified further by `exptrigsimp` because the pattern matching in function `f` does not recognize the structure for hyperbolic simplification (e.g., to `coth(1)/y`). Thus, the output is the input expression in its canonical form.
