[THOUGHT]
The function `format_string` converts a numeric string into its word representation. For the input "1000000":

1. Split the input at the decimal point: `lstr = "1000000"`, `rstr = ""` (no fractional part).
2. Reverse `lstr` to get "0000001". Since its length (7) modulo 3 is 1, pad with "00" to make it "000000100" (9 characters).
3. Split into 3 groups of 3 characters each from the reversed string:
   - Group 0 (indices 0-2): "000" → reverse → "000"
   - Group 1 (indices 3-5): "000" → reverse → "000"
   - Group 2 (indices 6-8): "100" → reverse → "001"
4. Process each group:
   - Group 0 ("000"): Skip (all zeros).
   - Group 1 ("000"): Skip (all zeros).
   - Group 2 ("001"): 
     - `trans_three("001")` checks the first digit '0', so calls `trans_two("01")`.
     - `trans_two("01")` sees '0' in tens place, returns `NUMBER[1]` → "ONE".
     - Magnitude for group index 2 is `NUMBER_MORE[2]` → "MILLION".
     - Result: "ONE MILLION".
5. Build the result: `lm = "ONE MILLION "` (stripped to "ONE MILLION").
6. Fractional part `rstr` is empty, so `xs = ""`.
7. Final output: `"ONE MILLION ONLY"` (since `lm` is not empty).
