[THOUGHT]
The function `_set_params` is called with `attr="_transformers"` and `kwargs={"n_jobs": 2}`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check if `attr` is in `kwargs`**:  
   `attr` is "_transformers", which is not in `kwargs` (which only has "n_jobs"). So no action is taken here.

2. **Get `items` from `self` using `attr`**:  
   `items = getattr(self, "_transformers")`.  
   In the input, `self` has no attribute "_transformers" (only "transformers" exists). However, the provided functions include a property `_transformers` for `ColumnTransformer` that returns `[(name, trans) for name, trans, _ in self.transformers]`. Since `self.transformers` is `null` (None), this property would raise a `TypeError` when iterated. But the input state doesn't include this property, so `getattr` fails. For simulation, we proceed with `items = None`.

3. **Extract `names` from `items`**:  
   Since `items` is `None`, `names` remains an empty list `[]`.

4. **Process `kwargs` keys**:  
   Iterate over keys in `kwargs` (only "n_jobs"). For each key:  
   - Check if "__" is not in the key: "n_jobs" has no "__" → True.  
   - Check if key is in `names`: `names` is empty → False.  
   So no action is taken in the loop.

5. **Call superclass `set_params`**:  
   `super(_BaseComposition, self).set_params(**kwargs)` is called with `{"n_jobs": 2}`.  
   This updates `self.n_jobs` to `2` (since "n_jobs" is a direct parameter without nested structure).

6. **Return `self`**:  
   The method returns the updated `self` with `n_jobs` changed to `2`. Other attributes remain unchanged.

**Final state of `self`**:  
- `transformers`: `null` (unchanged)  
- `remainder`: "drop" (unchanged)  
- `n_jobs`: `2` (updated)  
- `transformer_weights`: `null` (unchanged)  

The output is the updated `self` object.
