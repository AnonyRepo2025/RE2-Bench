The function `_stringify_py37` processes type annotations. Given the input annotation:
- `__module__` is "test_util_typing"
- `__doc__` is None
- No other attributes are provided (no `__qualname__`, `__origin__`, etc.)

Step-by-step execution:
1. `module = getattr(annotation, '__module__', None)` → "test_util_typing"
2. Since module is not "typing", skip the first block.
3. Check for `__qualname__`: not present → skip.
4. Check for `__origin__`: not present → skip.
5. Fall back to `else: return repr(annotation)`.
6. `repr(annotation)` for an object with these attributes would typically be `<test_util_typing.ClassName object at 0x...>`, but since the class name isn't specified, we use a placeholder (e.g., "Annotation").
7. The memory address is unpredictable, so a placeholder "0x100000000" is used.

Thus, the output is a string representation of the object: `<test_util_typing.Annotation object at 0x100000000>`.
