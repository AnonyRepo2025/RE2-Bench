The function `sympify` is called with the input string `a = "{2.0, 3}"`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Input Check**: The input `a` is a string (`"{2.0, 3}"`), which is not a SymPy object and has no `__sympy__` attribute.
2. **Converter Lookup**: The function checks for a converter for the `str` class and its superclasses in the `converter` dictionary. No converter is found.
3. **Non-strict Handling**: Since `strict=False` (default), it proceeds to handle non-strict cases:
   - The string is iterable, so it attempts to sympify each character individually (e.g., `{`, `2`, `.`, etc.). This fails because characters like `{` cannot be parsed as valid expressions, raising `SympifyError` internally.
   - The `TypeError` catch in the iterable handling block does not capture `SympifyError`, so this approach fails.
4. **String Parsing Fallback**: As a last resort, the entire string is processed by `parse_expr` with standard transformations:
   - The string `"{2.0, 3}"` is passed to the parser.
   - The parser (designed for SymPy expressions) does not recognize `{ ... }` as valid syntax for sets or other constructs. This results in a `TokenError` due to invalid syntax.
5. **Exception Raised**: The caught `TokenError` triggers a `SympifyError` with the message `"could not parse '{2.0, 3}'"`.

The function does not return a value; it raises a `SympifyError` due to the unparsable input string.
