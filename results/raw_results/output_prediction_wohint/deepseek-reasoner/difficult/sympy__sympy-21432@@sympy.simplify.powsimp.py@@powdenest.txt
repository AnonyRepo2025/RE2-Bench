The function `powdenest` is called with `eq="_x"`, `force=False`, and `polar=False`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check `force` parameter**: Since `force=False`, the first conditional block (lines 5-20) is skipped.
2. **Check `polar` parameter**: Since `polar=False`, the polar conversion block (lines 21-23) is skipped.
3. **Process `eq`**: 
   - `sympify(eq)` converts the string `"_x"` into a SymPy Symbol `_x`.
   - `powsimp(_x)` returns `_x` unchanged since there are no powers to simplify in a single symbol.
4. **Apply transformation**:
   - The result `_x` is passed to `xreplace(Transform(_denest_pow, ...))`.
   - The filter `lambda m: m.is_Pow or isinstance(m, exp)` only targets `Pow` or `exp` nodes. Since `_x` is a plain symbol (not a power or exponential), the transform does nothing.
5. **Final output**: The function returns the input symbol `_x` unchanged. In JSON-serializable form, this is represented as the string `"_x"`.

Thus, the output is the string `"_x"`.
