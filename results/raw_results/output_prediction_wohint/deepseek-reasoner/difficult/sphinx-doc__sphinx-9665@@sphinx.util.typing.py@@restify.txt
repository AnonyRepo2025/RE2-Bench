[THOUGHT]
The function `restify` is called with `cls=None` as input. Looking at the function logic:

1. The first condition checks: `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`
   - Since `cls` is `None`, this condition is true
2. The condition returns `':py:obj:`None`'` immediately

The rest of the code (NewType checks, union handling, etc.) is irrelevant since we exit early. The helper functions like `isNewType` and `safe_getattr` are not invoked in this case.

Therefore, the output should be the string `':py:obj:`None`'`.
