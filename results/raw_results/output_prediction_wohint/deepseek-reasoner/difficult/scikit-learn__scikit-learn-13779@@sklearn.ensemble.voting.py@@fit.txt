The `fit` method begins by checking if the `estimators` attribute is valid. The input shows `self.estimators` is `null` (None in Python), which triggers the first condition:

```python
if self.estimators is None or len(self.estimators) == 0:
    raise AttributeError('Invalid `estimators` attribute, `estimators` should be a list of (string, estimator) tuples')
```

Since `self.estimators` is `None`, an `AttributeError` is raised immediately. The subsequent checks (for weights, sample weights, etc.) are never executed. The error message explicitly states that the `estimators` attribute is invalid and must be a list of (string, estimator) tuples.
