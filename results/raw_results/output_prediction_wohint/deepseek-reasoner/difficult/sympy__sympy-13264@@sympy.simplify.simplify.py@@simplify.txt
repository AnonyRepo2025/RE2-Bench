The `simplify` function processes the input expression `1.0e-14*I` (a complex number with a very small imaginary part) as follows:

1. **Sympification**: The input string `"1.0e-14*I"` is converted to a SymPy expression: `Float(1e-14) * I`.
2. **Rational conversion skipped**: The `rational` parameter defaults to `False`, so the `nsimplify` step (which could convert floats to rationals) is bypassed.
3. **Simplification steps**:
   - `signsimp`, `bottom_up`, `powsimp`, `as_content_primitive`, `cancel`, and `together` leave the expression unchanged since it's a simple product of a float and the imaginary unit.
   - Subsequent steps (`factor_terms`, `hyperexpand`, `piecewise_fold`, `besselsimp`, `trigsimp`, `logcombine`, `combsimp`, `sum_simplify`, `product_simplify`, `powsimp`, `radsimp`, etc.) do not modify the expression as they target more complex structures (e.g., trigonometric, logarithmic, or summation terms).
4. **Measure comparison**: The simplified expression has the same complexity (`count_ops = 1`) as the original. Since `1` is not greater than `1.7 * 1`, the original expression is retained.
5. **Final output**: The expression remains `1.0e-14*I` (string representation: `"1.0e-14*I"`).
