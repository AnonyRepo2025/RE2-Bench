[THOUGHT]
The function in question is `__eq__` from the `Basic` class. The input has `self` as an empty dictionary and `other` as the string `"I*x"`. 

1. **Initial check**: `self is other` is `False` since `self` is an object and `other` is a string.
2. **Type comparison**: `type(self)` (some `Basic` subclass) is not `type(other)` (`str`), so proceed.
3. **Check for `Pow` with exponent 1**:
   - `isinstance(self, Pow)` requires `self` to be a `Pow` instance. Since `self` is given as an empty dict (no attributes), it cannot be a `Pow` (which has `_args` like `(base, exp)`). Skip.
   - `isinstance(other, Pow)` is `False` since `other` is a string. Skip.
4. **Sympify `other`**: Try converting `"I*x"` to a SymPy object via `_sympify(other)`, which calls `sympify("I*x", strict=True)`.
   - `sympify` parses the string and returns a `Mul` object: `I * x` (imaginary unit multiplied by symbol `x`).
5. **Type comparison after sympification**: 
   - `type(self)` (unknown, but represented by an empty dict) vs. `type(sympified_other)` (`Mul`). 
   - Since `self` has no type information in the input and isn't a `Mul`, `type(self) != type(sympified_other)` is `True`.
6. **Return `False`**: The types differ after sympification, so the method returns `False`.

**Why not other paths?**
- The `Pow` checks fail due to type mismatch.
- Sympify succeeds, so no `SympifyError`.
- Type mismatch after sympification prevents content comparison.

**Output**: `False`.
