The function `_osborne` is designed to convert hyperbolic functions to trigonometric functions using specific identities. The input expression is `2*sinh(2)`, and the function processes it as follows:

1. The expression `2*sinh(2)` is a multiplication of the integer `2` and the hyperbolic sine function `sinh(2)`.
2. The inner function `f` within `_osborne` checks each node in the expression. For `sinh(2)`, which is a `HyperbolicFunction`, it applies the identity: `sinh(a) â†’ I * sin(a)`, where `a` is the argument of `sinh`.
3. The argument `a` is `2`. Since `d` is not provided in the input, it defaults to `1` (as the function requires `d`, but the input does not specify it, leading to an assumption of `d=1` for the transformation). Thus, `a` remains `2`.
4. The transformation yields `I * sin(2)` for the `sinh(2)` term.
5. The full expression becomes `2 * (I * sin(2))`, which simplifies to `2*I*sin(2)`.

The `bottom_up` traversal ensures the transformation is applied to all matching nodes, resulting in the final expression `2*I*sin(2)`.
