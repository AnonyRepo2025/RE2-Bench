[THOUGHT]
The function `_map_drop_idx_to_infrequent` is called with `feature_idx=2` and `drop_idx="1"`. Looking at the method:

1. First, it checks `if not self._infrequent_enabled`. In the input, `self._infrequent_enabled` is `false`, so this condition is `True`.
2. Since the condition is true, the method immediately returns `drop_idx` (which is `"1"`) without executing any further code.

The rest of the method (handling infrequent categories) is skipped because `_infrequent_enabled` is false. Therefore, the output is simply the input `drop_idx` value.

Note: The input `drop_idx` is a string (`"1"`), and since we're returning it directly, the output remains a string.
