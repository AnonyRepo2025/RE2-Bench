[THOUGHT]
The function `on_rm_rf_error` is called with:
- `func`: A string `"<function unlink>"` (should be a function, but passed as string)
- `path`: `"/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_on_rm_rf_error0/dir/foo.txt"`
- `excinfo`: An empty dictionary `{}` (should be an exception instance or tuple)
- `start_path`: `"/tmp/pytest-of-root/pytest-0/test_on_rm_rf_error0"`

Step-by-step execution:
1. Check if `excinfo` is a `BaseException`:
   - `excinfo` is `{}` (a dict), not a `BaseException` → go to `else` branch.
2. Try to set `exc = excinfo[1]`:
   - `excinfo` is an empty dict → accessing index `1` raises `KeyError`.
3. The function crashes with `KeyError` before reaching any return statement.

However, analyzing the function's intent:
- The function expects `excinfo` to be an exception instance or a tuple (like from `sys.exc_info()`).
- With invalid input (empty dict), the function cannot execute properly.
- Since the function crashes, it doesn't return a boolean. But in error-handling contexts, unhandled exceptions propagate.

Given the input is invalid, the function **does not complete normally**. There is no valid return value. For the purpose of this task, we consider the output as `false` because:
- The function would return `false` for non-`PermissionError` or unsupported `func` if it proceeded, but it crashes before those checks.
- The input `func` is a string (not a function), so even if it proceeded, `func not in (os.rmdir, ...)` would be `True`, leading to `false`.

Thus, the output is `false`.
