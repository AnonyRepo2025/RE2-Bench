[THOUGHT]
The input shows that `other` is a `FiniteSet` with elements `{10, 15}`. The `_complement` method handles `FiniteSet` by sifting its elements based on membership in `self`. Since `self` is represented as an empty dictionary, it indicates `self` is likely the `EmptySet`. For `EmptySet`, any element is not contained, so:
- For element 10: `self.contains(10)` returns `False`
- For element 15: `self.contains(15)` returns `False`
Sifting yields:
- `sifted[False] = [10, 15]`
- `sifted[True] = []`
- `sifted[None] = []`
The result is `Union(FiniteSet(10, 15), EmptySet)`, which simplifies to `FiniteSet(10, 15)`.
