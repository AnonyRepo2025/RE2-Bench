The `log_loss` function computes the logarithmic loss for the given true labels and predicted probabilities. The inputs are:
- `y_true`: [0.0, 1.0] (binary true labels)
- `y_pred`: [0.0, 1.0] (predicted probabilities for the positive class)
- `eps`: 'auto' (uses machine epsilon for float64)

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Input Validation**:
   - `y_pred` is validated via `check_array` and remains a 1D float64 array: [0.0, 1.0].
   - `eps` is set to `np.finfo(np.float64).eps` (≈2.220446049250313e-16) since it's 'auto'.

2. **Consistent Length Check**:
   - `y_true` and `y_pred` both have 2 samples → consistent.

3. **Label Binarization**:
   - `LabelBinarizer` is fitted on `y_true` → classes are [0.0, 1.0].
   - `transformed_labels = lb.transform(y_true)` produces a 2D array: [[1, 0], [0, 1]] (one-hot encoded).

4. **Clipping and Reshaping**:
   - `y_pred` is clipped to [eps, 1-eps] → becomes [2.220446049250313e-16, 0.9999999999999998].
   - `y_pred` is reshaped to 2D: [[2.220446049250313e-16], [0.9999999999999998]].
   - Since it has 1 column, it's expanded to 2D probabilities:  
     [[0.9999999999999998, 2.220446049250313e-16],  
     [2.220446049250313e-16, 0.9999999999999998]].

5. **Validation**:
   - Number of classes (2) matches `y_pred`'s columns (2) → valid.

6. **Probability Normalization**:
   - Row sums are already ~1.0 → no change after normalization.

7. **Log Loss Calculation**:
   - For sample 0 (true: class 0):  
     Loss = -[log(0.9999999999999998) + log(1 - 2.220446049250313e-16)] ≈ -log(1 - eps) ≈ eps.
   - For sample 1 (true: class 1):  
     Loss = -[log(1 - 0.9999999999999998) + log(eps)] ≈ -log(eps) ≈ eps.
   - Per-sample losses: [eps, eps] = [2.220446049250313e-16, 2.220446049250313e-16].

8. **Weighted Sum**:
   - `sample_weight` is `None` → unweighted.
   - `normalize=True` → average the losses:  
     (eps + eps) / 2 = eps ≈ 2.220446049250313e-16.

### Output:
The logarithmic loss is approximately 2.220446049250313e-16.
