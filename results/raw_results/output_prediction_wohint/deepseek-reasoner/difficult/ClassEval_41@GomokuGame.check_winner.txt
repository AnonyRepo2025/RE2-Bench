[THOUGHT]
The `check_winner` method checks for five consecutive identical symbols in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal). The board has:
- Row 0: Five 'O's in columns 0-4 (horizontal win for 'O')
- Row 5: Five 'X's in columns 1-5 (horizontal win for 'X')

The method iterates row by row (0 to 9) and column by column (0 to 9). At (0,0), it finds 'O' and checks directions:
- (0,1) (horizontal right): Checks positions (0,0) to (0,4) → all 'O' → five in a row → returns True immediately.

Since a win is found at (0,0) in the first direction checked, `check_winner` returns 'O' without processing further cells or directions. The win for 'X' in row 5 is never evaluated because the method exits early.

Thus, the output is 'O'.
