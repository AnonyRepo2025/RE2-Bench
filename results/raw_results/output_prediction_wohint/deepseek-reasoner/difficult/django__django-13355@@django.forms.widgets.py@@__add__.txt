[THOUGHT]
The `__add__` method is called on a `Media` instance (`self`) with another `Media` instance (`other`) as argument. Both `self` and `other` have `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` set to `null` (interpreted as `None` in Python).

1. **Create `combined` instance**:  
   `combined = Media()` initializes a new `Media` object:
   - `_css_lists = [{}]` (since `css` defaults to `{}`)
   - `_js_lists = [[]]` (since `js` defaults to `[]`)

2. **Update `combined` from `self`**:  
   Attempt to set:
   - `combined._css_lists = self._css_lists[:]` → `None[:]`  
   - `combined._js_lists = self._js_lists[:]` → `None[:]`  
   **This raises a `TypeError`** because `None` is not subscriptable. The method cannot proceed further.

**Conclusion**:  
The operation fails due to `TypeError` when trying to slice `None` values. The output cannot be produced normally.
