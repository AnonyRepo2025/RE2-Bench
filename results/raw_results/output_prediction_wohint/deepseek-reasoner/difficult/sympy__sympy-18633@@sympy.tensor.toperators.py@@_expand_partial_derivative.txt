The method `_expand_partial_derivative` is called on a `PartialDerivative` instance. The input JSON shows that the instance has `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` set to `null`, but crucially, the `args` attribute (which holds the expression and variables) is not provided. This is problematic because:

1. The method relies on `self.expr` and `self.variables`, which are derived from `self.args[0]` and `self.args[1:]` respectively.
2. Without `args`, the first step—`self._contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)`—cannot execute, as `self.expr` and `self.variables` are undefined.

However, the method includes a base case:  
```python
if not args[0].free_symbols:
    return S.Zero
```  
If the expression (after index contraction) has no free symbols (e.g., a constant), it returns `S.Zero` (SymPy's zero). Given the incomplete input, the only safe assumption is that the expression is a constant (e.g., `0`), leading to this base case. Thus, the output is `0`.
