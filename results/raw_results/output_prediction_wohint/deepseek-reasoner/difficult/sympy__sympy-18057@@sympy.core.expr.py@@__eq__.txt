[THOUGHT]
The input asks for the output of the `__eq__` method when called with `other="picoweber"`. The `__eq__` method is defined in the `Expr` class. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The method first tries to `_sympify` the `other` argument ("picoweber"):
   - `_sympify` calls `sympify(a, strict=True)`
   - "picoweber" is a string but not a valid mathematical expression
   - Parsing fails with `TokenError` or `SyntaxError`, raising `SympifyError`

2. The `except (SympifyError, SyntaxError)` block catches this error and returns `False`

3. Since the sympification fails, the method returns `False` immediately without further checks.

Thus, the output is `False`.
