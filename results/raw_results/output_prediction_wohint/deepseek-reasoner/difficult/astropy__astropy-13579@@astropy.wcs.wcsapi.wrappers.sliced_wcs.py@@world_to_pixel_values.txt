[THOUGHT]
The function call is `world_to_pixel_values` with no arguments (`args` and `kwargs` are empty). The method expects world coordinate arrays as positional arguments, but none are provided. The number of required arguments is determined by `self._world_keep`, which is `[0, 1]` (two dimensions). Since no arguments are passed, accessing `world_arrays[0]` will fail with an `IndexError` because `world_arrays` is empty.

Additionally, `self._slices_pixel` is `null` (None), which would cause a `TypeError` if accessed in `_pixel_to_world_values_all` (since None is not subscriptable). However, the immediate failure occurs earlier due to the missing arguments.

The critical issue is the missing input arrays for world coordinates. The method requires two arrays (for the two kept world dimensions), but none are provided in the input. This results in an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of the empty `world_arrays` tuple.

Thus, the function cannot execute successfully and will raise an exception.
