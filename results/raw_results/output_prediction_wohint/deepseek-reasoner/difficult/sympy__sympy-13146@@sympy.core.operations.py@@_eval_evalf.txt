The function `_eval_evalf` is called on an instance of `AssocOp` (or a subclass) with `prec=2`. Given the input `"self": {}`, this implies the object has no arguments (i.e., `self.args` is empty). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check if `self` is `Add` or `Mul`**:  
   The function first checks `isinstance(self, (Mul, Add))`. Since `self` is provided as an empty object, it lacks attributes to be identified as `Add` or `Mul`. Thus, this branch is skipped.

2. **General case handling**:  
   The code iterates over `self.args` to evaluate each argument with `_eval_evalf(prec)`. Since `self.args` is empty (no arguments), the loop does nothing, and `args` remains an empty list.

3. **Return `self.func(*args)`**:  
   Calling `self.func()` with no arguments returns the identity element of the operation (as defined in `AssocOp.__new__`). For `AssocOp`, the identity is `None` by default, but in SymPy, `Add` uses `0` and `Mul` uses `1` as identities. However, since `self` is not specified as `Add`/`Mul`, and the input is empty, **the identity defaults to `0`** (common for additive identities).

4. **Output**:  
   The result is the identity element `0`.
