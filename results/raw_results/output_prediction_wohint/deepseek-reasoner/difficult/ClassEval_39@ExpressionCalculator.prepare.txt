The `prepare` method processes the given expression to convert it into postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation) using a stack. The input expression is "2+3+4". Here's the step-by-step simulation:

1. Initialize `op_stack` with [','] and `arr` as ['2', '+', '3', '+', '4'].
2. Iterate through each character:
   - '2' is not an operator → `count` becomes 1.
   - '+' is an operator:
     - Append substring "2" (from index 0 to 1) to `postfix_stack` → `postfix_stack = deque(['2'])`.
     - `peek_op` is ',' (from `op_stack`).
     - Since `peek_op` is ',', skip the while loop.
     - Push '+' to `op_stack` → `op_stack = deque([',', '+'])`.
     - Reset `count = 0`, `current_index = 2`.
   - '3' is not an operator → `count = 1`.
   - '+' is an operator:
     - Append substring "3" (from index 2 to 3) to `postfix_stack` → `postfix_stack = deque(['2', '3'])`.
     - `peek_op` is '+' (top of `op_stack`).
     - Compare current '+' and peek '+': 
       - `operat_priority` index for '+' is `ord('+') - 40 = 43 - 40 = 3` → value 1.
       - 1 >= 1 is True → pop '+' from `op_stack` and append to `postfix_stack` → `postfix_stack = deque(['2', '3', '+'])`.
     - Now `op_stack = deque([','])`, `peek_op` is ',' → skip while loop.
     - Push current '+' to `op_stack` → `op_stack = deque([',', '+'])`.
     - Reset `count = 0`, `current_index = 4`.
   - '4' is not an operator → `count = 1`.
3. After loop: `count = 1`, append "4" (from index 4) to `postfix_stack` → `postfix_stack = deque(['2', '3', '+', '4'])`.
4. Pop remaining operators from `op_stack` until ',':
   - Pop '+' and append to `postfix_stack` → `postfix_stack = deque(['2', '3', '+', '4', '+'])`.
   - `op_stack` now has only [','] → stop.

The method modifies `self.postfix_stack` to `deque(['2', '3', '+', '4', '+'])` but returns `None` since there's no return statement. The output of the function call is `None`.
