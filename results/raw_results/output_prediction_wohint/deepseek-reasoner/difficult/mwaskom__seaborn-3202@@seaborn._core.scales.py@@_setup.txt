[THOUGHT]
The `_setup` method processes a `data` Series and a `prop` Property object to configure a nominal scale. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Create a copy of `self`**: A new instance `new` is created as a copy of `self`. The input `self` has `values=null`, `order=null`, `_tick_params=null`, `_label_params=null`, and `_legend=null`.

2. **Set tick and label parameters**: Since `new._tick_params` is `null`, `new.tick()` is called (assumed to set `_tick_params` to a default, likely an empty dict). Similarly, `new.label()` sets `_label_params` to a default empty dict.

3. **Process data**: 
   - `stringify` is a vectorized function that formats values as strings.
   - `units_seed = categorical_order(data, new.order)` extracts unique categories from `data`. Since `data.name` is "x" and `new.order` is `null`, it returns unique values from `data` (exact values unknown, but it's a list of categories).

4. **Create matplotlib scale**: 
   - A custom `CatScale` class is defined, inheriting from `LinearScale`.
   - An instance `mpl_scale` is created with `name=data.name` ("x").

5. **Set up axis**: 
   - Since no `axis` is provided, a `PseudoAxis` is created (assumed to mimic an axis).
   - The axis view interval is set to `[0, len(units_seed)-1]`.
   - Axis units are updated with stringified `units_seed`.

6. **Define pipeline**:
   - `convert_units` maps input values to their position in `units_seed` (or NaN if not found).
   - `prop.get_mapping(new, data)` returns a mapping function (details unknown, but it's part of the pipeline).
   - `new._pipeline` is set to `[convert_units, prop.get_mapping(...)]`.

7. **Set spacer and legend**:
   - `new._spacer` is a function that always returns 1.
   - `prop.legend` is not provided in the input, so it defaults to `False`. Thus, `new._legend` remains `null`.

**Output structure**: The returned `new` object has:
- `values` and `order` unchanged (`null`).
- `_tick_params` and `_label_params` set to default empty dicts.
- `_legend` remains `null`.
- Other attributes (`_matplotlib_scale`, `_pipeline`, `_spacer`) are set but not serialized in the output (as they're complex objects).

The JSON output includes only the serializable attributes from the input structure.
