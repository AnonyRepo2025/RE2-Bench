The function `_finger` computes a fingerprint of the expression `eq` by analyzing the occurrence patterns of its free symbols. The input `eq` is a frozenset containing two expressions: `y & ~x` and `x & ~y`. 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify free symbols**: The free symbols in `eq` are `x` and `y`. These are collected using `eq.free_symbols`.
2. **Initialize tracking dictionary**: For each symbol (`x`, `y`), initialize a list of 5 zeros: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
3. **Process each argument in `eq`**:
   - The expression `eq` has two arguments: `y & ~x` and `x & ~y`.
   - For `y & ~x`:
     - It's an `And` expression with arguments `y` (Symbol) and `~x` (Not).
     - Compute `o = len(args) + count(Not) = 2 + 1 = 3`.
     - For `y` (Symbol): Increment index 2 by 1 and index 4 (last) by `o=3` → `y: [0, 0, 1, 0, 3]`.
     - For `~x` (Not): Increment index 3 for `x` by 1 → `x: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`.
   - For `x & ~y`:
     - It's an `And` expression with arguments `x` (Symbol) and `~y` (Not).
     - Compute `o = 2 + 1 = 3`.
     - For `x` (Symbol): Increment index 2 by 1 and index 4 by `o=3` → `x: [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]`.
     - For `~y` (Not): Increment index 3 for `y` by 1 → `y: [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]`.
4. **Final symbol counts**:
   - `x: [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]`
   - `y: [0, 0, 1, 1, 3]`
5. **Group symbols by fingerprint**: Both symbols have the same fingerprint tuple `(0, 0, 1, 1, 3)`, so they are grouped together in the inverse dictionary.
6. **Order symbols**: The symbols are ordered alphabetically (`x` before `y`) using `default_sort_key`.

### Output:
The output is a dictionary where the key is the fingerprint tuple `(0, 0, 1, 1, 3)` (represented as a string for JSON compatibility), and the value is the list of symbols `["x", "y"]`.
