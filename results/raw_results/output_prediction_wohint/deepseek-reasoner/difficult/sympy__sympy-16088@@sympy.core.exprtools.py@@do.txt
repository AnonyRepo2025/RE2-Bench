The input expression is: `-("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3) + "sqrt(3)"*I*("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3)`. However, the inner quotes around `"sqrt(21)"` and `"sqrt(3)"` are likely artifacts of JSON encoding and not part of the intended mathematical expression. After JSON parsing, the expression becomes: `-(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`. This is a valid SymPy expression when sympified.

### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Sympify the expression**:  
   The input string is converted to a SymPy expression:  
   `expr = -(sqrt(21) + 5)**(Rational(1, 3)) + sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(Rational(1, 3))`.

2. **Identify the structure**:  
   The expression is an `Add` with two terms:  
   - Term 1: `-(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`  
   - Term 2: `sqrt(3)*I*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`  

3. **Factor common subexpression**:  
   Both terms share the common subexpression `(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`. Let:  
   `A = (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)`.  
   The expression simplifies to:  
   `-A + sqrt(3)*I*A = A * (-1 + I*sqrt(3))`.

4. **Apply `factor_terms`**:  
   The function factors out the common subexpression `A`:  
   `(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) * (I*sqrt(3) - 1)`.

5. **Final factored form**:  
   The output is equivalent to:  
   `(-1 + I*sqrt(3)) * (5 + sqrt(21))**(1/3)`.

[OUTPUT]
{
  "expr": "(-1 + I*sqrt(3))*(5 + sqrt(21))**(1/3)"
}
