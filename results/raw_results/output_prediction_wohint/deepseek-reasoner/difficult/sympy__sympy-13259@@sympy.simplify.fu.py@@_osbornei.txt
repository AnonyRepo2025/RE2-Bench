[THOUGHT]
The function `_osbornei(e, d)` applies Osborne's rule to convert trigonometric functions to hyperbolic functions. The input expression is `e = "2*I*tan(_Dummy_561*x)"`, but this is provided as a string. For the function to work, it must be parsed into a SymPy expression. The symbol `d` is not provided in the input, but from the expression, `x` is the variable likely intended for transformation. 

Steps:
1. Parse the input string into a SymPy expression: `e = 2*I*tan(_Dummy_561*x)`.
2. The function processes the expression bottom-up. The only trigonometric function is `tan(_Dummy_561*x)`.
3. For `tan(_Dummy_561*x)`, split the argument `_Dummy_561*x` with respect to `d = x`:
   - Independent part (const) = 0
   - Dependent part (x_part) = `_Dummy_561*x`
4. Compute `a = x_part.xreplace({x: 1}) + const*I = _Dummy_561*1 + 0 = _Dummy_561`.
5. Apply Osborne's rule for `tan`: `tanh(a)/I = tanh(_Dummy_561)/I`.
6. Substitute back: `2*I * (tanh(_Dummy_561)/I) = 2*tanh(_Dummy_561)`.
7. The result is the expression `2*tanh(_Dummy_561)`, which should be returned as a string for output.

Thus, the output is the string representation of `2*tanh(_Dummy_561)`.
