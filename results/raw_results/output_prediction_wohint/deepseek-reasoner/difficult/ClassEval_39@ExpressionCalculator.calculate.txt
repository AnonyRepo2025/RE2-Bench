The function `calculate` processes the expression "2 + 4 / 4" as follows:

1. **Transform the expression**: 
   - Remove all whitespace: "2 + 4 / 4" becomes "2+4/4".
   - Check for '-' to replace with '~' (none found).
   - Result: "2+4/4".

2. **Prepare (convert to postfix)**:
   - Tokens: "2", "+", "4", "/", "4".
   - Using standard operator precedence (multiplication/division higher than addition/subtraction):
     - Push "2" to `postfix_stack`.
     - Push "+" to operator stack (since operator stack has ',' and '+' has higher precedence than ',').
     - Push "4" to `postfix_stack`.
     - For "/": higher precedence than "+" in operator stack, so push "/" to operator stack.
     - Push "4" to `postfix_stack`.
   - After processing tokens, pop operators from stack to `postfix_stack`: "/", then "+".
   - `postfix_stack` becomes: ["2", "4", "4", "/", "+"].

3. **Calculate**:
   - Reverse `postfix_stack`: becomes ["+", "/", "4", "4", "2"].
   - Process each token:
     - "2" (number) → push to `result_stack` → [2].
     - "4" (number) → push to `result_stack` → [2, 4].
     - "4" (number) → push to `result_stack` → [2, 4, 4].
     - "/" (operator) → pop 4 and 4 → 4 / 4 = 1 → push "1" → [2, 1].
     - "+" (operator) → pop 1 and 2 → 2 + 1 = 3 → push "3" → [3].
   - Final `result_stack`: ["3"].
   - Compute `float(eval('*'.join(result_stack)))`: 
     - `'*'.join(["3"])` → "3".
     - `eval("3")` → 3.
     - `float(3)` → 3.0.

Output is 3.0.
