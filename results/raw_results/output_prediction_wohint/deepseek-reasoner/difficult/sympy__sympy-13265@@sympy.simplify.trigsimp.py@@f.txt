The function `f` is designed to process multiplication expressions (`Mul`). The input expression `exp(2*I*x) + 1` is an addition (`Add`), not a multiplication. Therefore, the condition `if not rv.is_Mul` is satisfied, and `f` returns the input expression unchanged. No further processing occurs.

[OUTPUT]
{
    "result": "exp(2*I*x) + 1"
}
