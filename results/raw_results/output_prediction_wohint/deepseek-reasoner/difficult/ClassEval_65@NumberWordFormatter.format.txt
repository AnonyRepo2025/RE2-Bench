[THOUGHT]
The function `format` is called with `x` set to `null` (which is `None` in Python).  
In the `format` method:  
- It checks if `x` is not `None`.  
- Since `x` is `None`, it returns an empty string `''`.  

The other attributes of `self` (like `NUMBER`, `NUMBER_TEEN`, etc.) are initialized but not used in this case because the input `x` is `None`.  
Thus, the output is an empty string.
