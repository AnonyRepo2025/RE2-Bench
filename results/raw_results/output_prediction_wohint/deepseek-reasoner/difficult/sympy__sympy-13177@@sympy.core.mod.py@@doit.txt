[THOUGHT]
The input to `doit` is `p = "zoo"` and `q = "0"`. In SymPy, "zoo" represents complex infinity, and "0" is zero. 

The first condition in `doit` checks:
```python
if p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or (q is nan):
    return nan
```
- `p.is_infinite` is `True` because "zoo" (complex infinity) is infinite.
- `q.is_infinite` is `False` since 0 is finite.
- `p is nan` and `q is nan` are `False`.

Thus, the condition evaluates to `True`, and `doit` returns `nan` (Not a Number). None of the subsequent logic in `doit` is executed because the first condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the output of `doit` is `nan`.
