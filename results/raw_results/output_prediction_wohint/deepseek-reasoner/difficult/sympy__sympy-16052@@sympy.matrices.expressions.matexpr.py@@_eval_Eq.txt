[THOUGHT]
The `_eval_Eq` method is called with two arguments: `self` and `other`. The input shows both `self` and `other` as empty dictionaries, meaning they are generic objects without specific attributes. The method performs three checks:

1. **Check if `other` is a `MatrixExpr`**: Since `other` is an empty dictionary and not an instance of `MatrixExpr`, this condition fails, returning `False`.
2. **Shape comparison**: Not reached because the first condition fails.
3. **ZeroMatrix check**: Not reached because the first condition fails.

Thus, the method returns `False`.
