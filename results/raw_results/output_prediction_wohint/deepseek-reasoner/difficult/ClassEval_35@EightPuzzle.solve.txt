[THOUGHT]
The EightPuzzle class is initialized with an initial_state that is identical to the goal_state. The solve method uses a BFS approach to find the shortest path to the goal. Since the initial state is already the goal state, the algorithm will:

1. Start with open_list containing (initial_state, [])
2. Pop the first element: current_state = goal_state, path = []
3. Check if current_state == goal_state â†’ True
4. Immediately return the empty path []

No moves are needed since the puzzle is already solved. The move and get_possible_moves methods are never called in this case.
