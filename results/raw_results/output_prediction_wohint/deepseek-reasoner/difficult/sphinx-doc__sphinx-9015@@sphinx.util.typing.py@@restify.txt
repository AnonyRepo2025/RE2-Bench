To determine the output of the `restify` function for the given input, let's simulate the execution step by step:

1. **Input Analysis**: The input to `restify` is `cls = {"__module__": "tests.test_util_typing"}`, which is a dictionary with a `__module__` key.

2. **Initial Checks in `restify`**:
   - `cls is None or cls is NoneType`? No, `cls` is a dictionary.
   - `cls is Ellipsis`? No.
   - `cls in INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES`? No, `INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES` contains specific classes like `Struct` and `TracebackType`, not a dictionary.
   - `inspect.isNewType(cls)`? Let's evaluate:
     - `isNewType` calls `safe_getattr(cls, '__module__', None)` → returns `"tests.test_util_typing"` (key exists).
     - `safe_getattr(cls, '__qualname__', None)` → `__qualname__` key doesn't exist, so returns `None`.
     - `__module__ == 'typing'` is `False` ("tests.test_util_typing" ≠ "typing").
     - `isNewType` returns `False`.
   - `isinstance(cls, types_Union)`? `types_Union` is imported from `types`, but `types` module has no `Union` (likely an error). However, `cls` is a dictionary, not a `Union` type, so this check fails.
   - `cls.__module__ in ('__builtin__', 'builtins')`? `"tests.test_util_typing"` is not in this tuple, so `False`.

3. **Version-Specific Handling**:
   - The code branches based on `sys.version_info >= (3, 7)`, but the version is unspecified. However, the key issue is that the dictionary `cls` lacks a `__name__` attribute, which is required for generating the output string in either `_restify_py37` or `_restify_py36`.
   - When the version-specific function (e.g., `_restify_py37`) attempts to access `cls.__name__`, it will fail because dictionaries don't have a `__name__` attribute. This results in an `AttributeError`.

4. **Error Handling**: The function has no try-except block to handle the `AttributeError`. Thus, the function cannot complete successfully and raises an exception.

**Conclusion**: The function `restify` raises an `AttributeError` due to missing `__name__` in the input `cls`. Since the problem asks for the output variable values and no output is produced upon exception, the output is undefined. However, given the requirement to provide JSON output, we return an empty string as a fallback.
