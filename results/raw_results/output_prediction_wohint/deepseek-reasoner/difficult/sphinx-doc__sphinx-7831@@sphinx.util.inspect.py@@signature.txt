[THOUGHT]
The function `signature` attempts to get the signature of a callable object. The input provides a `subject` that is a dictionary with a `__signature__` attribute containing the string `"(arg, kwarg=None)"`. 

1. **Check `_should_unwrap`**:  
   This function checks if the subject should be unwrapped by verifying its globals. The subject is a dictionary, not a callable with `__globals__`, so `safe_getattr(subject, '__globals__')` returns `None`. Thus, `_should_unwrap` returns `False`.

2. **Get signature via `inspect.signature`**:  
   Since `_should_unwrap` is `False`, it calls `inspect.signature(subject, follow_wrapped=False)`. However, `subject` is a dictionary, which is **not callable**. This raises a `ValueError`.

3. **Handle `ValueError`**:  
   The code catches the `ValueError` and retries with `inspect.signature(subject)` (without `follow_wrapped`). But again, `subject` is not callable, so another `ValueError` occurs. This exception is **not caught** by the subsequent `except IndexError` block, as `ValueError` and `IndexError` are different.

4. **Result**:  
   The function raises an unhandled `ValueError` because `subject` is not callable. There is no valid return value, so the output is undefined.
