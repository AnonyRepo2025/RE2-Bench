The function `besselsimp` is designed to simplify expressions involving Bessel functions using identities and transformations. The input expression is:

```
exp(-I*pi*a/2) * besseli(a, 2*sqrt(x)) * exp_polar(I*pi/2)
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The function checks if the Bessel functions can be rewritten using identities. Specifically, it looks for factors like `I`, `exp_polar(I*pi/2)`, `exp_polar(-I*pi/2)`, `-1`, or `exp_polar(I*pi)` in the argument of the Bessel function.
2. In this expression, `besseli(a, 2*sqrt(x))` has an argument `2*sqrt(x)`, which is real and does not contain any of the specified factors (`I`, `exp_polar`, etc.).
3. The function attempts to replace `besseli` with `besselj` if the argument contains certain factors, but since `2*sqrt(x)` lacks these factors, no replacement occurs.
4. The function then checks if the order `a` is a half-integer or integer to expand the Bessel function. Since `a` is a symbolic variable (not a specific number), no expansion is performed.
5. The exponential terms `exp(-I*pi*a/2)` and `exp_polar(I*pi/2)` are not combined or simplified by the function, as its focus is on Bessel transformations.
6. No changes are made to the expression, so the output remains the same as the input.

The output is the original expression, as no simplifications were applied.
