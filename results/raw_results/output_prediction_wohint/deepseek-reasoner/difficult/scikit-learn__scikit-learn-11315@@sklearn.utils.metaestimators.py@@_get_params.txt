[THOUGHT]
The function `_get_params` is called with `attr="_transformers"` and `deep=True`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Superclass get_params call**:  
   First, `super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=True)` is called. This invokes `BaseEstimator.get_params(deep=True)`, which:
   - Collects parameter names from `self._get_param_names()` (constructor parameters).
   - For each parameter, gets its value and recursively collects sub-parameters if `deep=True` and the value is an estimator with `get_params`.
   - The input `self` has parameters: `transformers` (null), `remainder` (dict-like), `n_jobs` (1), `transformer_weights` (null).  
   - Since `remainder` is a simple dict-like object (no `get_params` method), and others are non-estimators, the super call returns:  
     ```
     {
         "n_jobs": 1,
         "remainder": {"with_mean": true, "with_std": false, "copy": true},
         "transformer_weights": null,
         "transformers": null
     }
     ```

2. **Check for deep=False**:  
   `deep=True`, so we proceed.

3. **Get estimators list**:  
   `estimators = getattr(self, attr)` → `getattr(self, "_transformers")`. The input `self` has no `_transformers` attribute. However, the provided function `_transformers` (for `ColumnTransformer`) is a method, not a data attribute. Since the input state doesn't include this method, and `transformers` is null, we assume `_transformers` resolves to an empty list (as `self.transformers` is null and the method would return an empty list if implemented).

4. **Update with estimators**:  
   `out.update(estimators)` → `out.update([])` does nothing since the list is empty.

5. **Recursive parameter collection**:  
   The loop `for name, estimator in estimators` is skipped (empty list), so no additional parameters are added.

6. **Final output**:  
   The result is the dictionary from the superclass call, unchanged.

Thus, the output matches the superclass result with keys sorted alphabetically.
