[THOUGHT]
The `process_csv_data` method is called with `N=1` and `save_file_name="read_test.csv"`. Here's the step-by-step execution:

1. **Read CSV File**:  
   `read_csv("read_test.csv")` is called. It reads the file and returns a tuple `(title, data)`, where:
   - `title` is the first row (header) of the CSV.
   - `data` is a list of all subsequent rows.

2. **Extract and Transform Column**:  
   For each row in `data`, extract the column at index `1` (since `N=1`), and convert each value to uppercase. This creates `column_data`, a list of uppercase strings from the second column.

3. **Prepare New Data**:  
   `new_data` is constructed as `[title, column_data]`.  
   - `title` is a list of header fields (e.g., `["Header1", "Header2", ...]`).
   - `column_data` is a list of values (e.g., `["VALUE1", "VALUE2", ...]`).

4. **Write to New CSV File**:  
   `write_csv(new_data, "read_test_process.csv")` is called:
   - Attempts to write `new_data` to `read_test_process.csv`.
   - `writer.writerows(new_data)` writes:
     - Row 1: The `title` header (as multiple columns).
     - Row 2: The entire `column_data` list as a single row (each value becomes a column in this row).
   - Returns `1` if successful, `0` on failure.

**Assumptions**:  
- The file `read_test.csv` exists and is readable.
- Every row in `data` has at least 2 columns (no `IndexError`).
- Writing to `read_test_process.csv` succeeds (no permissions/disk issues).

Since the method returns `1` on success, and no errors are indicated, the output is `1`.
