[THOUGHT]
The `BalancedBrackets` class checks if an expression has balanced brackets. Given the initial state:
- `self.stack` starts with `['[']`
- `self.expr` is `"[(){}"`

The `check_balanced_brackets` method processes the expression:
1. `clear_expr()` removes non-bracket characters, but `"[(){}"` contains only brackets, so it remains unchanged.
2. Iterate through each character in `"[(){}"`:
   - `[` (index 0): Left bracket → push to stack → stack becomes `['[', '[']`
   - `(` (index 1): Left bracket → push to stack → stack becomes `['[', '[', '(']`
   - `)` (index 2): Right bracket → pop `(` from stack → `(` matches `)` → stack becomes `['[', '[']`
   - `{` (index 3): Left bracket → push to stack → stack becomes `['[', '[', '{']`
   - `}` (index 4): Right bracket → pop `{` from stack → `{` matches `}` → stack becomes `['[', '[']`
3. After processing, the stack is not empty (contains two `[`), so return `False`.

The output is `False` because the expression is unbalanced due to unmatched `[` brackets.
