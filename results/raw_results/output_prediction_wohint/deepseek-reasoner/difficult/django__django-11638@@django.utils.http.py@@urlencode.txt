The function `urlencode` is called with:
- `query` = [["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]
- `doseq` = False (default)

Step-by-step execution:
1. `isinstance(query, MultiValueDict)` is False, so it checks `hasattr(query, 'items')`. Since `query` is a list, not a dict, this is also False.
2. The code treats `query` as an iterable of key-value pairs and processes each pair:
   - For ["a", 1]: 
     - Value 1 is not None → valid
     - `doseq=False` → treat as single value (not sequence)
     - `query_val` = 1 (integer)
   - For ["b", 2]: same as above → `query_val` = 2
   - For ["c", 3]: same as above → `query_val` = 3
3. The resulting `query_params` list is [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)].
4. This list is passed to `original_urlencode` (the standard urllib's urlencode) with `doseq=False`.
5. `original_urlencode` converts integers to strings and produces the query string "a=1&b=2&c=3".

The function returns this string.
