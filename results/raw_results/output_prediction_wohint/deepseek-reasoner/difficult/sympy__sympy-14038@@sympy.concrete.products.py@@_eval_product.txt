The input for the `_eval_product` function is invalid because the `limits` argument is provided as a list with only one element (`["1"]`). The function expects `limits` to be a tuple of three elements `(k, a, n)` representing the index variable, lower bound, and upper bound, respectively. 

When the function attempts to unpack the list into three variables (`k, a, n = limits`), it will raise a `ValueError` because the number of elements (1) does not match the expected number (3). 

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
1. The function receives `limits = ["1"]` (a list with one string element).
2. The function tries to unpack: `k, a, n = ["1"]`.
3. This requires 3 values, but only 1 is provided â†’ `ValueError`.

[OUTPUT]
{
  "error": "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 1)"
}
