The function `_setup` processes a continuous scale for visualization. Given the input:

1. **Initial State**: The `self` object has `trans="log"`, indicating a logarithmic transformation. Both `_tick_params` and `_label_params` are `null`, so `tick()` and `label()` methods will be called to initialize them (exact values unknown, but they become non-null).

2. **Transform Setup**: Since `trans="log"`, the forward and inverse transforms are logarithmic. A matplotlib `LogScale` is created for the data named "ymax".

3. **Axis Handling**: No axis is provided, so a `PseudoAxis` is created. The axis is updated with the data (though data values aren't provided, the name "ymax" is used).

4. **Normalization**: `prop.normed` is not set in the input (only `prop.variable="y"` is present), so normalization is skipped. Thus, `normalize`, `vmin`, and `vmax` are `None`.

5. **Pipeline Construction**: The processing pipeline includes:
   - `axis.convert_units`: Converts data to axis units.
   - `forward`: Applies the log transform.
   - `normalize`: Skipped (set to `None`).
   - `prop.get_mapping`: Maps transformed data to visual properties (exact function depends on `prop`).

6. **Spacer Function**: A function to compute the minimum non-zero difference between sorted unique values is defined (not executed here).

7. **Legend**: `prop.legend` is not set, so no legend information is generated (`_legend` remains `null`).

**Output Structure**: The returned object (`new`) includes:
- Original attributes (e.g., `values=null`, `norm=null`, `trans="log"`, `_priority=0`).
- Updated `_tick_params` and `_label_params` (non-null, but exact values unknown).
- `_matplotlib_scale` as a `LogScale` instance.
- `_pipeline` as a list of processing steps.
- `_spacer` as a function.
- `_legend` remains `null`.

Since JSON can't serialize functions or complex objects directly:
- Functions are represented by their names.
- `LogScale` is noted as a string.
- `_tick_params`/`_label_params` are placeholders (set to `{}` to indicate non-null).
