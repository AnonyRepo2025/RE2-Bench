[THOUGHT]
The `generate_primes` method implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to `n`. Given `n = 15`:

1. Initialize a boolean list `sieve` of length 16 (indices 0 to 15) with all `True`, then set `sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False` (0 and 1 are not primes).
2. Start with `p = 2`:
   - `p² = 4 ≤ 15` → `sieve[2]` is `True`, so mark multiples starting at 4: 4,6,8,10,12,14 as `False`.
3. `p = 3`:
   - `p² = 9 ≤ 15` → `sieve[3]` is `True`, so mark multiples starting at 9: 9,12,15 as `False`.
4. `p = 4`:
   - `p² = 16 > 15` → loop ends.
5. Collect primes: indices 2 to 15 where `sieve[i]` is `True` → [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13].

The existing `primes` value in `self` is irrelevant because `generate_primes` recomputes the list from scratch using `n`. Thus, the output is `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`.
