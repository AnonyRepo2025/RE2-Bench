[THOUGHT]
The function in question is `MatMul.args_cnc`. Given the input has empty `self`, `args`, and `kwargs`, this implies the `MatMul` instance has no arguments. 

1. **Analyze `as_coeff_matrices`**:
   - `scalars` collects non-matrix arguments: since there are no arguments, `scalars = []`.
   - `matrices` collects matrix arguments: similarly, `matrices = []`.
   - `coeff = Mul(*scalars) = Mul()` (empty product), which evaluates to the multiplicative identity `1` (an `Integer`).

2. **Process `coeff.args_cnc`**:
   - `coeff` is `1` (an `Integer`), which doesn't have `args_cnc` directly. However, `Integer` inherits from `Rational`, and `Rational.as_coeff_Mul` returns `(self, S.One) = (1, 1)`.
   - For `1`, this is treated as having commutative part `[1]` and non-commutative part `[]`.

3. **Adjust `coeff_c`**:
   - The code checks: `coeff_c == [1]` â†’ true, so it sets `coeff_c = []`.

4. **Combine results**:
   - `coeff_nc + matrices = [] + [] = []`.
   - The return value is `(coeff_c, coeff_nc + matrices) = ([], [])`.

Thus, the output is a tuple of two empty lists.
