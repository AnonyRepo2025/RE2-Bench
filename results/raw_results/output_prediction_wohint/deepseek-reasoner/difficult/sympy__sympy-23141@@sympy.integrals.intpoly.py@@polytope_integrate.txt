The function `polytope_integrate` is called with two arguments: `poly` (an empty dictionary) and `expr` (the string `"x**2 + x*y + y**2"`). The function expects `poly` to be either a `Polygon` object or a list representing a polytope. However, an empty dictionary is neither. 

1. **Check `poly` type**: The function first checks `if isinstance(poly, Polygon)`. Since `poly` is a dictionary, this fails.
2. **Check for H-representation**: Next, it checks `elif len(poly[0]) == 2`. Here, `poly[0]` attempts to access the key `0` in the empty dictionary, which does not exist. This raises a `KeyError: 0`.

The function does not handle this error, so the call will result in a `KeyError` exception. The `expr` is never processed due to the early failure.
