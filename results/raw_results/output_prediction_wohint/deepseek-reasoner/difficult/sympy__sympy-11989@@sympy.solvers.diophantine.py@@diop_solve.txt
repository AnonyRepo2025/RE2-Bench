The equation provided is `2*x - 3*y - 5 = 0`, which is a linear Diophantine equation. The solution involves finding integer solutions for `x` and `y`.

### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Classify the equation**: The function `classify_diop` identifies the equation type as 'linear' because it has two variables (`x` and `y`) and a total degree of 1.
2. **Solve the linear equation**: The equation is `2x - 3y = 5`. The solution exists because the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 2 and 3 is 1, which divides 5.
3. **Find a particular solution**: One particular solution is `x = 1`, `y = -1` because `2(1) - 3(-1) = 2 + 3 = 5`.
4. **General solution**: The general solution is given by:
   - `x = x0 + (b/d) * t`
   - `y = y0 - (a/d) * t`
   where `a = 2`, `b = -3`, `d = gcd(2, 3) = 1`, and `(x0, y0) = (1, -1)`. Substituting the values:
   - `x = 1 + (-3/1) * t = 1 - 3t`
   - `y = -1 - (2/1) * t = -1 - 2t`
5. **Parametric form**: The solution is expressed in terms of the parameter `t` (an integer), resulting in the tuple `(1 - 3*t, -1 - 2*t)`.
6. **Output representation**: The solution set is represented as a set containing this parametric tuple. In JSON, this is an array of arrays, with expressions as strings.
