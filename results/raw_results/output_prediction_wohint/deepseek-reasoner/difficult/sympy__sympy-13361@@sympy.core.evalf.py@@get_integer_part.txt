The function `get_integer_part` is called with `expr = 1/2`, `no = -1`, `options = {}`, and `return_ints = True`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial evalf call**:  
   The function first calls `evalf(expr, 30, options)` to evaluate `1/2` at 30 bits of precision. Since `1/2` is a rational number, `evalf` returns:
   - `ire = (0, 1, -1, 1)` (mpf tuple for 0.5)
   - `iim = None` (no imaginary part)
   - `ire_acc = 30` (precision for real part)
   - `iim_acc = None`

2. **Gap calculation**:  
   Since there's no imaginary part, the gap is computed for the real part:  
   `gap = fastlog(ire) - ire_acc = (-1) - 30 = -31` (where `fastlog(ire)` for `(0,1,-1,1)` is `exp + bc - 1 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1`).  
   With `margin = 10`, `gap < -margin` (-31 < -10) is true, so no recomputation occurs.

3. **Real part processing**:  
   `calc_part` is called for the real part `re(expr) = 1/2` with `nexpr = ire = (0,1,-1,1)`:  
   - `nint = to_int(nexpr) = 0` (converts 0.5 to integer 0 via rounding).  
   - Since the exponent `-1 â‰  0`, `expr - nint = 1/2 - 0 = 1/2` is evaluated at 10 bits precision, yielding `(0.5, None, 10, None)`.  
   - `mpf_cmp(0.5, 0) = 1` (positive), and `1 == no` (where `no = -1`) is `False`, so `nint` remains 0.  
   - Returns `(from_int(0), INF) = ((0,0,0,0), INF)`.

4. **Imaginary part processing**:  
   `iim` is `None`, so `im_` and `im_acc` are set to `fzero` (implicitly 0) and `INF`.

5. **Final output**:  
   Since `return_ints = True`, convert the results to integers:  
   - `int(to_int(re_ or fzero)) = int(0) = 0`  
   - `int(to_int(im_ or fzero)) = int(0) = 0`  
   The output is the tuple `(0, 0)`.
