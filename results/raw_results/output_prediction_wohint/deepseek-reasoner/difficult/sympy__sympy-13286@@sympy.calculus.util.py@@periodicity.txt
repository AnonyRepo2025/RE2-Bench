The function `periodicity` determines the period of a given function with respect to a symbol. For the input function `f = csc(2*x) - sec(x)`, the period is computed as follows:

1. **Simplify the function**: The expression `csc(2*x) - sec(x)` is simplified, but remains unchanged as it is already in a simplified form.
2. **Identify trigonometric components**: The function consists of two trigonometric terms:
   - `csc(2*x)` has a period of `π` (since the period of `csc(k*x)` is `2π/|k|`, and here `k=2`).
   - `sec(x)` has a period of `2π`.
3. **Compute the combined period**: The period of the sum/difference of periodic functions is the least common multiple (LCM) of their individual periods. The LCM of `π` and `2π` is `2π`.
4. **Verification**: 
   - `f(x + 2π) = csc(2(x + 2π)) - sec(x + 2π) = csc(2x + 4π) - sec(x + 2π) = csc(2x) - sec(x) = f(x)`, confirming `2π` is a period.
   - No smaller positive period exists, as `f(x + π) = csc(2x + 2π) - sec(x + π) = csc(2x) + sec(x) ≠ f(x)`.

Thus, the period of `csc(2*x) - sec(x)` is `2π`.
