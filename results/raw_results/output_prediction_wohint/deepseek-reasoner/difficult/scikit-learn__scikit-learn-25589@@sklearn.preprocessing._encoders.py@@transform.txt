The provided input state for the `OneHotEncoder` instance is inconsistent and incomplete, leading to an exception during the `transform` method execution. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Checks**: The `transform` method starts with `check_is_fitted(self)`. The instance has attributes like `n_features_in_=1`, which indicates it was fitted, but critical fitted attributes (`categories_`, `_n_features_outs`) are `null` (Python `None`). The `check_is_fitted` passes because the attributes exist (even though their values are `None`), but this inconsistency causes errors later.

2. **_transform Execution**:  
   - `_check_feature_names` and `_check_n_features` pass (input `X` has 1 feature, matching `n_features_in_=1`).  
   - `_check_X` processes `X = [['55555'], ['22']]` into a list of arrays: `[array(['55555', '22'], dtype=object)]`.  
   - For the feature (index 0):  
     - `_check_unknown` is called with `self.categories_[0] = None`. This returns `valid_mask = [True, True]` (no unknowns).  
     - `_encode` computes uniques as `['22', '55555']` (sorted lexically) since `uniques=None`. Encodes `'55555'` as `1`, `'22'` as `0`.  
     - `X_int` becomes `[[1], [0]]` and `X_mask` remains `[[True], [True]]`.

3. **Post-_transform Steps**:  
   - `_map_infrequent_categories` is skipped (`_infrequent_enabled=False`).  
   - Drop handling is skipped (`drop=None`).  
   - **Failure Point**: `feature_indices = np.cumsum([0] + self._n_features_outs)` is called. Since `self._n_features_outs` is `None`, this operation `[0] + None` raises a `TypeError`.

**Conclusion**: The missing `_n_features_outs` (a fitted attribute) causes a `TypeError`. The output cannot be computed due to invalid state.
