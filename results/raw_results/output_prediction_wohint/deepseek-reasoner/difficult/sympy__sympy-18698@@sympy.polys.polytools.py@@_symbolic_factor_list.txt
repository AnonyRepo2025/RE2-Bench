To determine the output of `_symbolic_factor_list` for the input `expr = "x + 4"`, `opt = {}`, and `method = "factor"`, we simulate the execution step by step:

1. **Initialization**:  
   The function starts with `coeff = S.One` (which is `1`) and `factors = []`.

2. **Process `expr` using `Mul.make_args`**:  
   `expr = "x + 4"` is an `Add` expression. `Mul.make_args(expr)` converts it into a tuple of multiplicative terms: `(x + 4,)`.

3. **Iterate over each term in the tuple**:  
   There is only one term: `x + 4`.  
   - It is not a `Number`, so skip the first condition.  
   - It is not a `Pow`, so set `base = x + 4` and `exp = S.One` (which is `1`).

4. **Attempt to convert `base` to a polynomial**:  
   Call `_poly_from_expr(base, opt)`:  
   - `base = x + 4` is sympified to the expression `x + 4`.  
   - Since `opt.expand` defaults to `True`, the expression is expanded (though `x + 4` is already expanded).  
   - `_dict_from_expr` converts `x + 4` into a polynomial representation: `{(1,): 1, (0,): 4}` with generator `x` and domain `ZZ` (integers).  
   - This creates a `Poly` object: `Poly(x + 4, x, domain='ZZ')`.

5. **Call `factor_list` on the `Poly`**:  
   `func = getattr(poly, 'factor_list')` returns the `factor_list` method.  
   Calling `poly.factor_list()` for the linear polynomial `x + 4` returns:  
   - `_coeff = 1` (the leading coefficient).  
   - `_factors = [(Poly(x + 4, x, domain='ZZ'), 1)]` (the irreducible factor and its exponent).

6. **Update `coeff` and `factors`**:  
   - `_coeff` is `1`, so `coeff` remains `1`.  
   - Since `exp = 1`, we extend `factors` with `_factors`:  
     `factors = [(Poly(x + 4, x, domain='ZZ'), 1)]`.

7. **Skip grouping for non-'sqf' method**:  
   Since `method = 'factor'` (not `'sqf'`), the final grouping step is skipped.

8. **Return the result**:  
   The function returns `(coeff, factors) = (1, [(Poly(x + 4, x, domain='ZZ'), 1])`.

**Output Representation**:  
The coefficient is `1`. The factor is represented as the expression string `"x + 4"` (since the `Poly` object corresponds to this expression), and the exponent is `1`. The output is structured as a JSON object with keys `"coeff"` and `"factors"`, where `"factors"` is a list of tuples.
