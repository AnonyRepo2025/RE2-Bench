[THOUGHT]
The function `replace_named_groups` processes regex patterns by replacing named groups (like `(?P<name>...)`) with just the group name (e.g., `<name>`). The input pattern is `"admin/password_change/done/"`, which contains no named groups (no `(?P<...>` sequences). Therefore:
1. `named_group_matcher.finditer()` finds no matches in the input string.
2. The loop to build `group_pattern_and_name` runs 0 times.
3. The replacement loop also runs 0 times.
4. The function returns the original pattern unchanged.
