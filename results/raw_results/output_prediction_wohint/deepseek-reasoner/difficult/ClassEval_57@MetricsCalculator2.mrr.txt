[THOUGHT]
The input provided for the `mrr` method is:
```json
{
    "data": [
        [
            0,
            0,
            0,
            1
        ],
        4
    ]
}
```

This is a list containing two elements: 
1. A sub-list `[0, 0, 0, 1]`
2. An integer `4`

The `mrr` method expects `data` to be either:
- A tuple of `(sub_list, total_num)`, or 
- A list of such tuples (for multiple queries)

Here, `data` is a list but not a list of tuples. The code processes it in the list branch:
```python
if type(data) == list:
    separate_result = []
    for sub_list, total_num in data:  # Attempts to unpack each element in data
        ...
```

The loop iterates over each element in `data`:
- First element: `[0, 0, 0, 1]` (a list of 4 integers)
- Second element: `4` (an integer)

When unpacking the first element into `(sub_list, total_num)`, it expects exactly two values, but finds four. This raises a `ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)`.

The function does not handle this error, so the method will raise the exception during execution.
