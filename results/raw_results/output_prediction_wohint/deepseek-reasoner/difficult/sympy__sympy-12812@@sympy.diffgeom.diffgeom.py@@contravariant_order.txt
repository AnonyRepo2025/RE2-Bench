The function `contravariant_order` processes the input expression based on its type. The input provided is an empty dictionary `{}` for `expr`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The function checks if `expr` is an instance of `Add` (it isn't, since it's a dictionary).
2. It then checks if `expr` is a `Mul` (it isn't).
3. Next, it checks for `Pow` (not applicable).
4. It checks for `BaseVectorField` (not applicable).
5. Then `TensorProduct` (not applicable).
6. The final condition is: `elif not _strict or expr.atoms(BaseScalarField)`. Since `_strict` is `False` (default value, as not specified in kwargs), `not _strict` evaluates to `True`. This triggers the branch and returns `0`.

The empty dictionary doesn't match any specific tensor types, and due to `_strict=False`, the function defaults to returning `0` for any unrecognized input that isn't explicitly a vector/tensor type.
