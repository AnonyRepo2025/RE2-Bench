[THOUGHT]
The function `get_format` is called with `format_type="jS \\o\\f F"` and `use_l10n=None`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Check `use_l10n`**: Since `use_l10n` is `None`, the function attempts to get `settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL`. This internally resolves to `settings.USE_L10N`, which defaults to `True` in Django if not explicitly set.

2. **Determine language**: With `use_l10n=True` and `lang=None`, `get_language()` is called. This returns the active language (e.g., `'en-us'` if no override exists).

3. **Check cache**: The cache key `(format_type, lang)` (e.g., `("jS \\o\\f F", "en-us")`) is not found in `_format_cache`.

4. **Lookup in format modules**: With `use_l10n=True`, the function iterates over format modules for the language (e.g., `django.conf.locale.en.formats`). The attribute `"jS \\o\\f F"` is not a standard Django format setting (like `DATE_FORMAT`), so it won't exist in these modules. Thus, `val` remains `None`.

5. **Fallback logic**: Since `val is None` and `"jS \\o\\f F"` is not in `FORMAT_SETTINGS` (which contains standard keys like `DATE_FORMAT`), the function returns `format_type` directly as a string.

6. **ISO formats check**: The format type is not in `ISO_INPUT_FORMATS`, so no additional processing occurs.

7. **Cache and return**: The value `"jS \\o\\f F"` is cached and returned as-is.

**Output**: The function returns the input string `"jS \\o\\f F"` unchanged since it's not a recognized format setting and isn't found in localization modules.
