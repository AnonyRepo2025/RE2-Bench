The function `orthogonal_mp_gram` is called with the provided inputs. The key parameters are:
- `Gram`: A 12x12 Gram matrix
- `Xy`: A 12x1 target vector
- `n_nonzero_coefs`: 1 (only one non-zero coefficient requested)
- `tol`: None (not used)
- `norms_squared`: [4.64744652] (squared norm of the target)
- `copy_Xy`: False (no copy of Xy is made)

The function proceeds as follows:
1. **Input validation and preprocessing**:
   - `Gram` is validated and converted to Fortran-contiguous order.
   - `Xy` is reshaped to (12, 1) since it's a single column.
   - Parameters are checked: `n_nonzero_coefs=1` is valid (â‰¤12 features).

2. **Initialization**:
   - A coefficient matrix `coef` of shape (12, 1) is initialized to zeros.

3. **Processing each target column** (only one column here):
   - `_gram_omp` is called with:
     - `Gram`: The 12x12 matrix
     - `Xy[:, 0]`: The target vector [0.1260535, -0.4460294, ..., -0.09414498]
     - `n_nonzero_coefs=1`
     - `norms_squared=None` (since `tol` is None)
     - `tol=None`
     - `copy_Gram=True` (Gram is copied)
     - `copy_Xy=False` (no copy of Xy)

4. **Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) in `_gram_omp`**:
   - **Initial residual** (`alpha`) is the target vector.
   - **Find the atom most correlated with the residual**:
     - Absolute values: [0.126, 0.446, 0.293, 0.842, 2.156, 1.609, 0.259, 1.347, 1.247, 0.669, 0.168, 0.094]
     - Maximum absolute value is **2.15579371** at **index 4**.
   - **Update steps**:
     - Atom 4 is selected and moved to the front via row/column swaps.
     - The Cholesky factor `L` is updated: `L[0,0] = sqrt(Gram[4,4]) = 1.0`.
     - The system `L * gamma = Xy[0]` is solved: `gamma = [2.15579371]`.
   - **Termination**: `n_active = 1` reaches `max_features = 1`, so the loop breaks.

5. **Output construction**:
   - The coefficient for atom 4 (original index) is set to 2.15579371.
   - Other coefficients remain 0.
   - The coefficient vector is squeezed to shape (12,).

**Output**: The coefficient vector has one non-zero value at index 4 (5th position), matching the selected atom.
