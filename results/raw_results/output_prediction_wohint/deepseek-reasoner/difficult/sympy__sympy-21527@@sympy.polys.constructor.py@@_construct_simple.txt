[THOUGHT]
The function `_construct_simple` is called with `coeffs = None` and `opt = {}`. The first operation in the function accesses `opt.extension` to set the `is_algebraic` lambda. However, `opt` is an empty dictionary, and dictionaries do not support attribute access (like `opt.extension`). This will raise an `AttributeError` because `'dict' object has no attribute 'extension'`. The function does not handle this exception, so it will terminate with an error. There is no valid return value.
