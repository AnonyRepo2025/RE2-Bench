The function `_matrix_derivative(expr, x)` computes the derivative of a matrix expression `expr` with respect to a symbol `x`. Given the input, `expr` is a 2x2 matrix with unspecified elements (represented by `_mat: null`), and `x` is the symbol "x".

1. **Evaluate `expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)`**:
   - This calls the method `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` on `expr`. Since `expr` is a matrix, it uses the default implementation from `Expr` (as no matrix-specific override is provided in the given code).
   - The method returns `_LeftRightArgs([S.One, S.One], higher=self._eval_derivative(x))`.
   - `self._eval_derivative(x)` computes the element-wise derivative of the matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, this results in a new 2x2 matrix where each element is the derivative of the original element w.r.t. `x`.

2. **Process the lines**:
   - `lines` is a list with one `_LeftRightArgs` object. Calling `build()` on it returns a list of factors: `[1, 1, M]`, where `M` is the derivative matrix (2x2 with derivatives of original elements).

3. **Convert parts to matrices**:
   - `convert_array_to_matrix` is applied to each factor: `1` remains `1`, and `M` (already a matrix) is unchanged. Thus, `parts` becomes `[[1, 1, M]]`.

4. **Compute rank**:
   - For the inner list `[1, 1, M]`, `_get_shape` returns:
     - For `1`: `(1, 1)` → both dimensions are `1` (ignored in rank calculation).
     - For `M`: `(2, 2)` → both dimensions are not `1` or `None`, contributing 2 to the rank.
   - Total rank = 2.

5. **Construct output**:
   - Since rank ≤ 2, compute `Add.fromiter([contract_one_dims(i) for i in parts])`.
   - For `i = [1, 1, M]`, `contract_one_dims`:
     - Multiplies the first two factors: `1 * 1 = 1`.
     - Multiplies the result by the remaining factor: `1 * M = M`.
   - The output is the derivative matrix `M`.

**Resulting Matrix**:
- `M` is a 2x2 matrix where each element is the derivative of the corresponding element in the original matrix w.r.t. `x`.
- Since the original elements are unspecified, they are represented symbolically as `MatrixElement(expr, i, j)`. Thus, the elements of `M` are:
  - `Derivative(MatrixElement(expr, 0, 0), x)`
  - `Derivative(MatrixElement(expr, 0, 1), x)`
  - `Derivative(MatrixElement(expr, 1, 0), x)`
  - `Derivative(MatrixElement(expr, 1, 1), x)`

The output is a JSON representation of this matrix with `_rows=2`, `_cols=2`, and `_mat` as the list of derivative expressions.
