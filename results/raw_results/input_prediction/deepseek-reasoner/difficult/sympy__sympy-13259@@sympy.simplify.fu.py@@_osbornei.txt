[THOUGHT]
The function `_osbornei` transforms trigonometric functions into hyperbolic functions using complex identities. The output is "2*tanh(x)", which is a hyperbolic tangent. The transformation for tangent is `tan(a) â†’ tanh(a)/I`. To get `tanh(x)`, we need an input that includes `I*tan(x)` because:
- `I * tan(x)` transforms to `I * (tanh(x)/I) = tanh(x)`
- Therefore, `2*tanh(x)` requires `2*I*tan(x)` as input.

The transformation depends on splitting the argument of the trig function using `d`, but since the output has no constant term (just `x`), and the structure doesn't require specifying `d`, we assume `d` is handled externally. The input expression `e` must be `2*I*tan(x)` to produce the given output.
