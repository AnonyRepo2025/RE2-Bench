The output shows a sparse matrix with 2 rows and 1 column, containing two non-zero entries: (0,0)=1 and (1,0)=2. The `col_join` method vertically stacks `self` and `other` matrices. 

Key observations:
1. The output matrix has 2 rows, so: `self.rows + other.rows = 2`.
2. The output's `_smat` contains entries at (0,0) and (1,0). Since `self._smat` is empty (per input structure), all non-zero entries must come from `other`.
3. `other` is represented as a dense matrix (has `_mat` attribute). For a 2x1 matrix, `_mat` should be a flat list `[row0_val, row1_val]`.
4. The condition `self.rows == 0` must hold because:
   - If `self.rows > 0`, entries from `self` would appear in the output, but `self._smat` is empty.
   - The output's (0,0) entry must come from `other`, so `self.rows` must be 0 to place `other`'s first row at index 0.
5. Column compatibility: `self.cols` must equal `other.cols` (both 1).

Thus:
- `self.rows = 0`, `self.cols = 1` (empty matrix)
- `other.rows = 2`, `other.cols = 1`, `other._mat = [1, 2]` (dense matrix with values 1 and 2)

This configuration produces the exact output when `col_join` copies the empty `self`, then adds `other`'s entries at positions (0,0) and (1,0).
