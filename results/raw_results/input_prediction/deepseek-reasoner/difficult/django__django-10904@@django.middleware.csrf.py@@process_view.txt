[THOUGHT]
The output shows an HTTP response with headers indicating a text/html content type and no cookies. This response is generated by the `_reject` method in the `CsrfViewMiddleware` when CSRF validation fails. The response has been logged (`"_has_been_logged": true`), which occurs during rejection.

To trigger rejection due to a missing CSRF cookie (REASON_NO_CSRF_COOKIE):
1. The request method must be unsafe (not GET/HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE), so we use POST.
2. The request must not be marked as exempt from CSRF checks (`csrf_exempt` false and `_dont_enforce_csrf_checks` false).
3. `request.is_secure()` returns false (non-HTTPS) to skip referer checks.
4. `request.META['CSRF_COOKIE']` is None, triggering REASON_NO_CSRF_COOKIE.
5. Other fields (like cookies, session) are set to null/empty since they're unused for this rejection path.
6. Arbitrary values are used for unused request attributes (path, content_type, etc.) as they don't affect the outcome.

This configuration ensures the middleware rejects the request due to a missing CSRF cookie, producing the given output.
