[THOUGHT]
The function `is_valid_move` returns false if any of these conditions are met:
1. Either position is out of bounds (based on BOARD_SIZE)
2. Both positions are identical
3. The icons at the positions are different
4. There is no valid path between them (via adjacent same-icon tiles)

Given the output is false, I need to choose an input that triggers one of these conditions. Using the board state from the test method (a 4x4 grid with repeating ['a','b','c','a'] rows), I select the simplest case: identical positions. For pos1 and pos2 both set to (0,0), the function will:
- Pass boundary checks (0 â‰¤ 0 < 4)
- Fail the "same position" check (pos1 == pos2), returning false
This satisfies the output requirement with minimal complexity.
