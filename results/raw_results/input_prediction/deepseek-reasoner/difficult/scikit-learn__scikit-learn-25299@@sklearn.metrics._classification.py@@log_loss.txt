The output value 2.2204460492503136e-16 is the machine epsilon for float64 (approximately 2.22e-16), which occurs when the log loss is computed with predictions very close to 1.0 for the true class. 

Key observations from the function:
1. `log_loss` requires at least two distinct classes (binary or multiclass).
2. When `eps='auto'`, it uses `np.finfo(y_pred.dtype).eps` (float64 epsilon by default).
3. Perfect predictions (y_pred=1.0 for true class) get clipped to `1 - eps`, resulting in loss ≈ eps.
4. With `normalize=True` (default), the loss is averaged over samples.

To achieve the exact output:
- Use binary classification with two samples (one per class).
- Set true labels as `[0, 1]`.
- Set predicted probabilities as perfect: `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` (after clipping, becomes `[[1-eps, eps], [eps, 1-eps]]`).
- Loss per sample ≈ eps (≈2.22e-16), averaged to eps.
- `eps='auto'` ensures float64 epsilon is used.

Thus, the input should be:
- `y_true = [0, 1]`
- `y_pred = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`
- `eps = 'auto'`
