The output shows a fingerprint `(0, 0, 1, 1, 3)` with a value of `null`, indicating that no symbols have this fingerprint. However, the fingerprint must originate from a symbol in the equation. The fingerprint `(0, 0, 1, 1, 3)` corresponds to a symbol that:
- Appears once as a nested symbol in an operation (count2=1)
- Appears once as a nested `Not` in an operation (count3=1)
- Has a cumulative 'o' value of 3 for nested symbol occurrences (count4=3)

The 'o' value is calculated as `len(operation.args) + number of Not in operation.args`. To achieve o=3, an operation must have 3 arguments including at least one `Not`. 

The equation must contain an operation like `Or(x, Not(x), y)` where:
- The top-level operation (e.g., `And`) has one argument: the `Or` operation
- The `Or` operation has three arguments: `x`, `Not(x)`, and a dummy symbol `y` (to reach 3 args)
- This structure ensures the fingerprint `(0, 0, 1, 1, 3)` for `x` due to:
  - Nested `x` in `Or` → count2=1, count4 += o (where o=3 for `Or`)
  - Nested `Not(x)` in `Or` → count3=1 for `x`

However, the output value is `null`, suggesting no symbols match this fingerprint. This implies the equation must be structured to have the fingerprint but with no actual symbols (e.g., using placeholders). The input structure requires specifying `_argset` for the equation. The top-level `_argset` should contain one element: the `Or` operation with `_argset` `["x", {"func": "Not", "_argset": ["x"]}, "y"]`.

Thus, the input `eq._argset` is a set (represented as a list in JSON) containing the `Or` operation with the described arguments.
