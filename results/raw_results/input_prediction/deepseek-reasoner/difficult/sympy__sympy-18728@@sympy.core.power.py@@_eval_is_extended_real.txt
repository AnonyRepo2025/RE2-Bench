[THOUGHT]
The goal is to determine an input (a Pow instance) for which `_eval_is_extended_real` returns True. The output is {"output": true}, meaning the method evaluates to True. 

Key conditions from `_eval_is_extended_real` that return True:
1. If `base` is extended real and positive, and `exp` is extended real: returns True.
2. If `base` is nonnegative, `exp` is nonnegative, and both are extended real: returns True.
3. If `exp` is an integer and `base` is nonzero/extended real: returns True.

Simplest case: Use a base that is positive and real (e.g., 2) and an exponent that is real (e.g., 3). This satisfies condition 1:
- `base.is_extended_real` = True (2 is real)
- `exp.is_extended_real` = True (3 is real)
- `base.is_extended_positive` = True â†’ returns True.

Thus, the input is a Pow instance with `base=2` and `exp=3`. The method takes no additional args/kwargs.
