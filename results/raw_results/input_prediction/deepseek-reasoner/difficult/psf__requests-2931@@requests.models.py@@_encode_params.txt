The output is "z=1&a=1&k=1&d=1", which is a URL-encoded string of key-value pairs. The function `_encode_params` processes the input `data` as follows:

1. The output indicates `data` was processed as an iterable (not a string/bytes or file-like object), since we get a parameter string.
2. The function uses `to_key_val_list` to convert `data` into a list of key-value tuples. This function:
   - Rejects strings/bytes/booleans/integers (would raise ValueError)
   - Converts mappings to their items
   - Converts other iterables to a list
3. The output shows 4 key-value pairs: (z,1), (a,1), (k,1), (d,1) in that order.
4. To preserve this exact order, `data` must be an ordered iterable (like a list of tuples), not a dictionary (which doesn't guarantee order).
5. Each value is a single integer (1), so they don't need to be wrapped in iterables. The function handles single values by converting them to [value].
6. Therefore, the input `data` should be: [('z', 1), ('a', 1), ('k', 1), ('d', 1)]

This matches the output when processed by:
- Iterating through each (k, vs) pair
- Converting vs=1 to [1]
- Appending (k, 1) to the result
- URL-encoding as "z=1&a=1&k=1&d=1"
