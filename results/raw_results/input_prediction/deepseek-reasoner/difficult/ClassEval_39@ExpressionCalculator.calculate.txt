[THOUGHT]
The output is 3.0, so the expression must evaluate to 3. The ExpressionCalculator processes expressions by:
1. Transforming the input: removing spaces, handling negatives (replacing '-' with '~' in certain contexts), and adjusting leading negatives.
2. Converting to postfix notation using a stack.
3. Evaluating the postfix expression.

For the expression "3":
- Transformation: "3" remains unchanged.
- Preparation: The single token "3" is added to postfix_stack.
- Calculation: The postfix_stack ["3"] is processed. Since it's not an operator, it's pushed to result_stack. The final evaluation is float(eval('3')) = 3.0.

The initial state of the object has an empty postfix_stack and the default operat_priority [0, 3, 2, 1, -1, 1, 0, 2]. Thus, the input expression is "3".
