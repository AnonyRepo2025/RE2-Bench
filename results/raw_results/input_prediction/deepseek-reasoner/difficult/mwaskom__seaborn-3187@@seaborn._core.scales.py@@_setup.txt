1. The output shows `"trans": "log"`, so the input `self.trans` must be "log".
2. The output has `"values": null` and `"norm": null`, so the input `self.values` and `self.norm` must be null.
3. The output shows `"_tick_params"` and `"_label_params"` as dictionaries with null values, but in the method, these are set by `tick()` and `label()` if they were None. Therefore, the input must have `self._tick_params = None` and `self._label_params = None`.
4. The output has `"_legend": null`. Since `_legend` is only set if `prop.legend` is True, and it's null in the output, `prop.legend` must be False. However, `prop.legend` isn't in the input structure, so we only control `prop.variable`.
5. The output has `"_priority": 0`, so the input `self._priority` must be 0.
6. The method doesn't modify `data` or `prop` directly, but uses `data.name` and `prop.normed`/`prop.legend`. Since `prop.normed` must be False (as normalization isn't set in the output) and `prop.legend` must be False, we can choose any `prop.variable` value.
7. For `data`, the structure requires specific fields, but the output doesn't constrain them. We set arbitrary values that fit the structure, including `_name` (used in `str(data.name)`).
8. `kwargs` is empty, as per the structure.
