The output is ":obj:`tests.test_util_typing.T`", which is produced by the `restify` function. Analyzing the function's logic:

1. The output matches neither the None/Ellipsis cases nor the INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES branch (which uses `:class:`).
2. It doesn't match the NewType branch (which also uses `:class:` and requires module='typing').
3. It doesn't match the Union branch (which outputs pipe-separated types or Optional).
4. The builtins branch is skipped since the module isn't '__builtin__' or 'builtins'.
5. The output uses `:obj:`, which suggests it's generated by `_restify_py37` or `_restify_py36` for non-builtin types.

Given the output contains "tests.test_util_typing.T", the input `cls` must:
- Have `__module__ = "tests.test_util_typing"`
- Have `__name__ = "T"` (though not specified in the structure, it's implied by the output)
- Not be a NewType (since module isn't 'typing')
- Not be a builtin class

Thus, the required input for `cls.__module__` is "tests.test_util_typing".
