[THOUGHT]
The output shows 8 samples with 2 features and labels [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. This indicates:
1. Total samples = 8, distributed as 5 for cluster 0 and 3 for cluster 1.
2. Since the distribution is uneven, `n_samples` must be a list [5, 3] to match the output counts.
3. The labels 0 and 1 imply 2 clusters, so `centers` should be `None` to auto-generate 2 centers.
4. The specific data points require reproducible randomness, so `random_state` must be set to a fixed integer (0 is used as a common default).
5. Other parameters (n_features=2, cluster_std=1.0, etc.) use defaults and don't need specification.
