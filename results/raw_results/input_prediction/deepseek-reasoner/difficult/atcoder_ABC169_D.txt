The code factorizes an input integer \( x \) and computes a value \( ans \) by processing the exponents of its prime factors. For each prime factor with exponent \( num \), it finds the largest integer \( j \) such that the triangular number \( T_j = j(j+1)/2 \leq num \). The value \( ans \) is the sum of these \( j \) values across all prime factors.

Given the output is 2, we need an input \( x \) such that the sum of \( j \) values is 2. Possible cases:
- One prime factor with exponent \( num \) where \( j = 2 \): \( num \) must be 3, 4, or 5 (since \( T_2 = 3 \leq num < T_3 = 6 \)).
- Two prime factors, each with \( j = 1 \): each exponent must be 1 or 2 (since \( T_1 = 1 \leq num < T_2 = 3 \)).

Testing small integers:
- \( x = 1 \): Factorization is \([[1, 1]]\), skipped (prime 1), so \( ans = 0 \).
- \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5 \): \( ans = 1 \).
- \( x = 6 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \): Exponents are 1 and 1, so \( j = 1 \) for each, \( ans = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
- \( x = 8 = 2^3 \): Exponent 3 gives \( j = 2 \) (since \( T_2 = 3 \leq 3 \)), so \( ans = 2 \).

The smallest integer yielding \( ans = 2 \) is 6. Thus, the input string is "6".
