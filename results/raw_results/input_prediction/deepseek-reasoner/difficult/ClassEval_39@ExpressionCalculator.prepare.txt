[THOUGHT]
The `prepare` method returns `None` (output is null) regardless of input, as it doesn't have a return statement. The method processes the input expression to build a postfix stack in `self.postfix_stack`, but since the output constraint is only the return value (null), any valid expression would satisfy the output condition. 

The initial state of `self` is determined by the `__init__` method:
- `postfix_stack` starts as an empty deque
- `operat_priority` is fixed as `[0, 3, 2, 1, -1, 1, 0, 2]`

For the expression, I choose a simple valid input "1+1" that the method can process without errors. The operators in this expression ('+') are handled by the code's logic, and the method will execute without returning any value (hence null output). The initial `postfix_stack` is empty, and `operat_priority` remains unchanged from initialization.
