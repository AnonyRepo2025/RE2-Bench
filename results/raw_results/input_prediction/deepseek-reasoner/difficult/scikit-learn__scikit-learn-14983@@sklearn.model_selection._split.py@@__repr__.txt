[THOUGHT]
1. The output string "PredefinedSplit(test_fold=\"array([1, 1, 2, 2])\")" is generated by the `__repr__` method of the `PredefinedSplit` class.
2. The `__repr__` method (via `_build_repr`) typically includes key attributes of the object. Here, it shows the `test_fold` attribute with value `array([1, 1, 2, 2])`.
3. The `test_fold` attribute must be a numpy array containing the values `[1, 1, 2, 2]`. In JSON-compatible form, this is represented as a list: `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
4. The `unique_folds` attribute isn't shown in the output, but it's part of the input structure. For a `test_fold` array of `[1, 1, 2, 2]`, the unique folds would be `[1, 2]` (sorted unique values).
5. Since `args` and `kwargs` are empty (as per the structure), no additional arguments are passed to `__repr__`.
