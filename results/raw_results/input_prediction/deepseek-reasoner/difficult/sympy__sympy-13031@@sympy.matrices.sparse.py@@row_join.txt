The output shows a sparse matrix with 2 rows and 1 column, containing values "1" at (0,0) and "2" at (1,0). The `row_join` method combines `self` and `other` matrices horizontally. Key observations:

1. **Output columns = 1**: Since `row_join` sets `A.cols += B.cols`, and output has 1 column, we have `self.cols + other.cols = 1`.
2. **Non-zero entries at column 0**: This implies `self` had 0 columns initially (otherwise, `other`'s entries would appear at column `self.cols` â‰¥ 1).
3. **Output rows = 2**: Requires `self.rows == other.rows = 2` (per shape check).
4. **Entries sourced from `other`**: The output entries match positions in `other` (dense matrix branch used since `other` has `_mat` attribute). Values "1" and "2" correspond to `other._mat = [1, 2]`.

Thus:
- `self`: 2 rows, 0 columns, empty `_smat`.
- `other`: 2 rows, 1 column, `_mat = [1, 2]`.
