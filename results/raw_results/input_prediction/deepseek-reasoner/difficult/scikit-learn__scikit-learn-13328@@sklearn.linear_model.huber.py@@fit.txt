1. The output shows fitted attributes of the HuberRegressor after calling `fit()`:
   - `n_iter_ = 58` indicates 58 iterations were performed
   - `coef_` has 20 elements → X must have 20 features
   - `outliers_` has 50 booleans → 50 samples in X and y
   - Other parameters match initialization values

2. For input reconstruction:
   - `self` parameters should match output's epsilon, max_iter, alpha, warm_start, fit_intercept, tol
   - Fitted attributes (n_iter_, scale_, etc.) are not set before `fit()` → set to null
   - X must be a (50, 20) array (50 samples × 20 features)
   - y must be a (50,) array
   - sample_weight isn't used in output → not provided (null)

3. Execution simulation:
   - `check_X_y` validates X (50,20) and y (50,)
   - `sample_weight = None` → becomes all-ones array
   - L-BFGS-B optimization runs for 58 iterations
   - Final parameters set to output values

4. Placeholder strategy:
   - Use "array of shape (50, 20)" for X
   - Use "array of shape (50,)" for y
   - Fitted attributes null since not initialized
   - sample_weight omitted (default None)
