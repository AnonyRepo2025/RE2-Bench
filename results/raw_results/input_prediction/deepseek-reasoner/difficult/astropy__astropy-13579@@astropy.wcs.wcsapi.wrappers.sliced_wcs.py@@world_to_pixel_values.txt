1. The output shows two very small numbers (near zero) for pixel coordinates. This suggests the input world coordinates correspond to the reference point of the WCS where pixel values are typically zero.
2. The `world_to_pixel_values` method uses `sliced_out_world_coords` for non-kept world dimensions. These are computed by calling `_pixel_to_world_values_all` with zeros for kept pixel dimensions.
3. For the output to be near zero:
   - The underlying WCS must have its reference point at pixel (0,0)
   - The slice starts (`_slices_pixel`) must be 0 so no adjustment is needed
   - Kept dimensions (`_pixel_keep`, `_world_keep`) should cover all dimensions
4. The output has 2 values, so:
   - `pixel_n_dim = 2` → `_pixel_keep = [0,1]`
   - `world_n_dim = 2` → `_world_keep = [0,1]`
5. `_slices_pixel` should be slices with start=0 to avoid adjustments
6. The WCS (`_wcs`) needs:
   - `naxis=2` (2D)
   - `_naxis=2`
   - `_pixel_bounds=None` (no bounds)
   - `_init_kwargs` can be default (empty selections)
7. `_slices_array` isn't used here, so set to empty list
8. With this configuration, passing world coordinates (0,0) would produce pixel coordinates near (0,0)
