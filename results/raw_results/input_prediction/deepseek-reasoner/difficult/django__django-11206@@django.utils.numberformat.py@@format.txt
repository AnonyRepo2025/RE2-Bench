[THOUGHT]
The output is a very long negative integer string without any formatting (no thousand separators, no decimal part). The function `format` has an early return for integers when `use_grouping` is false and `decimal_pos` is None, but it returns the integer directly (not a string), which would cause issues since the output is a string. 

To avoid the early return and ensure the output is a string, the input `number` should be passed as a string. This way:
1. The function skips the early return since it's not an integer.
2. The string is processed: the sign is extracted, and since there's no decimal point, `int_part` becomes the entire numeric string.
3. With `decimal_pos` as None (default) and `use_grouping` false (since the output has no separators), the function returns the original string unchanged.
4. `decimal_sep` can be any character (like '.') since it's unused when there's no decimal part.

Thus, the input `number` is the exact output string, and `decimal_sep` is '.'.
