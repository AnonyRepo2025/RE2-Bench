[THOUGHT]
The function `replace_named_groups` processes a regex pattern by replacing named groups (e.g., `(?P<name>...)`) with their group names (e.g., `<name>`). The output is "admin/password_change/done/", which contains no named group syntax (no angle brackets or regex patterns). This indicates the input pattern had no named groups to replace, as the function returns the original pattern unchanged when no named groups are present. Therefore, the input pattern must be identical to the output string.
