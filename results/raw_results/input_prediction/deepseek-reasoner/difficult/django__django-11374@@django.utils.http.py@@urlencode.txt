The output is "a=1&b=2&c=3", which is a URL-encoded string representing three key-value pairs. The function `urlencode` processes the input `query` parameter as follows:

1. If `query` is a `MultiValueDict`, it calls `.lists()` to get key-value pairs. However, the provided implementation of `.lists()` for `MultiValueDict` returns the same as a standard dictionary's items (key-value pairs), not lists of values.
2. If `query` has an `.items()` method (like a dictionary), it uses that to get key-value pairs.
3. Since `doseq=False` (default), each value is treated as a single value, not iterated.
4. The function then encodes each key-value pair, converting non-string values to strings.

Given the output contains simple key-value pairs without repeated keys, the input `query` can be:
- A dictionary: `{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}`
- A list of tuples: `[("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)]`
- A `MultiValueDict` that yields the same pairs via `.lists()`

The simplest representation is a dictionary. The values can be integers or strings since they're converted to strings during encoding. Using integers is valid and matches the output after conversion.
