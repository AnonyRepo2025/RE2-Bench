[THOUGHT]
The output is a list of two strings: `["-x**3", "1"]`, representing the numerator and denominator respectively. The function `fraction` processes the input expression by separating it into numerator and denominator parts based on the sign of exponents and rational number components.

For the output numerator `-x**3` and denominator `1`:
- The expression must be a product of terms where:
  - A negative sign (from `-1`) appears in the numerator.
  - `x**3` (with positive exponent) appears in the numerator.
  - No terms with negative exponents exist (since denominator is `1`).
- The simplest expression satisfying this is `-x**3`. When processed:
  - `-1` is a rational number → split into numerator `-1` and denominator `1`.
  - `x**3` is a positive power → added to numerator.
  - Numerator becomes `-1 * x**3 = -x**3`.
  - Denominator becomes `1`.
- Alternative forms like `x**3 * -1` yield the same result due to commutativity.

Thus, the input expression should be `-x**3`.
