The output shows an array of 5 datetime strings with nanosecond precision:
- All dates are on 1681-05-27
- Times are at 12:00:00.5, 13:00:00.5, 14:00:00.5, 15:00:00.5, and 16:00:00.5
- The consistent 0.5-second offset suggests fractional time units

Key observations:
1. The year 1681 is within pandas' supported range (1678-2262), so the pandas decoding path would be used
2. The 1-hour intervals between timestamps indicate the time unit is hours
3. The 0.5-second offset must come from either:
   a) Fractional hours in num_dates, or 
   b) Fractional seconds in the reference time
4. Using a clean reference time with fractional seconds is simpler than fractional hours

Reconstruction:
- Set reference time to "1681-05-27 12:00:00.5" to embed the 0.5s offset
- Use unit "hours" since this matches the 1-hour intervals
- Set num_dates as [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] to generate the 5 timestamps
- Calendar is "standard" (default) since no non-standard calendar features are present

Verification:
With units="hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.5":
- 0 hours → 1681-05-27T12:00:00.5
- 1 hour → 1681-05-27T13:00:00.5
- ... matches output exactly
