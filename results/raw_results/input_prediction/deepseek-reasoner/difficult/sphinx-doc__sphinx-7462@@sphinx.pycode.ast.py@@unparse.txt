[THOUGHT]
The output is "[1, 2, 3]", which matches the pattern produced by the `unparse` function for an `ast.List` node. The function processes `ast.List` nodes by returning a string with comma-separated elements enclosed in brackets. To produce "[1, 2, 3]", the `node` argument must be an `ast.List` with three elements, each representing the numbers 1, 2, and 3.

Each element should be an `ast.Num` node, as the function handles numbers via `ast.Num` (returning `repr(node.n)`). The location attributes (`lineno`, `col_offset`, `end_lineno`, `end_col_offset`) are not used by `unparse`, so they can be set to 0 for simplicity. The `ctx` attribute for the top-level node is required by the structure but unused by `unparse`, so it remains an empty dictionary.

Thus, the input `node` should have:
- `elts`: A list of three `ast.Num` nodes (represented as dictionaries) with `n` values 1, 2, and 3.
- `ctx`: An empty dictionary.
- Location attributes set to 0.

The inner `ast.Num` nodes only need the `n` attribute and location attributes (all set to 0), as `unparse` only uses `n` for numbers.
