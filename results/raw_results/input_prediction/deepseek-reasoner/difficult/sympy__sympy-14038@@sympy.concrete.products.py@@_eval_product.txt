The output is `2**Sum(2*f(k), (k, 1, n))`, which is a power expression with base 2 and a Sum in the exponent. The Product._eval_product method handles Pow expressions in the term parameter. Specifically, when the base of the power does not depend on the index variable (k), it computes the product as the base raised to the sum of the exponent over the given limits.

In this case:
- The term must be a Pow expression: `2**(2*f(k))`
  - Base: 2 (constant, independent of k)
  - Exponent: `2*f(k)` (depends on k)
- The limits must be `(k, 1, n)` to match the Sum in the output
- When processed:
  - `summation(term.exp, (k, 1, n))` becomes `Sum(2*f(k), (k, 1, n))`
  - Result: `2 ** Sum(2*f(k), (k, 1, n))`

Thus, the input term is `2**(2*f(k))` and limits are `(k, 1, n)`. In JSON, term is represented as a string, and limits as a list with symbol names and bounds.
