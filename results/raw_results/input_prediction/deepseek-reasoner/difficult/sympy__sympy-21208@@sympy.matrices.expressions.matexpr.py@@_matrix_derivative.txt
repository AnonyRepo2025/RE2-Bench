[THOUGHT]
The output shows a matrix-like structure with `_rows=2`, `_cols=2`, and `_mat=null`. This matches the internal representation of a symbolic matrix (like `ImmutableDenseMatrix`) in SymPy. The function `_matrix_derivative` computes derivatives of matrix expressions. Given the output, the input `expr` must be a 2x2 matrix. Since `_mat` is null, it indicates the matrix elements are symbolic (not numerical), so we'll use symbolic elements. The derivative variable `x` can be any symbol; we'll choose `Symbol('x')` for simplicity. The structure requires maintaining `_rows=2`, `_cols=2`, and `_mat=null` for `expr`, and `x` as a symbol.
