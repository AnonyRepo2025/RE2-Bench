The output is "nan", which occurs in the `doit` function when:
1. `p` is infinite (`p.is_infinite` is True)
2. `q` is infinite (`q.is_infinite` is True)
3. `p` is `nan` (`p is nan` is True)
4. `q` is `nan` (`q is nan` is True)

To achieve this:
- Choose `p = oo` (SymPy's infinity), which makes `p.is_infinite` True
- Choose `q = 1` (a finite number), so other conditions don't trigger
- This combination will hit the first condition in `doit` and return `nan`
- Represent `p` and `q` as SymPy-parsable strings in JSON
