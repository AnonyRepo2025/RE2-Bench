[THOUGHT]
The output is `[1, null]`, which corresponds to the return value of `_symbolic_factor_list`: `(coeff, factors) = (1, [])`. 

To achieve this:
1. The coefficient `coeff` starts as `S.One` (1) and the factors list is empty.
2. The input expression `expr` must be a constant (number) that evaluates to 1, as:
   - `Mul.make_args(expr)` will return `(1,)` for `expr=1`.
   - The argument `1` is a `Number`, so `coeff *= 1` remains 1.
   - No factors are added to the list since the argument is fully absorbed into the coefficient.
3. The method can be either `'factor'` or `'sqf'` since constant expressions don't invoke polynomial factorization. We choose `'factor'` arbitrarily.
4. `opt` is passed as an empty dict `{}` as per the structure. Since `expr=1` is a number, `_poly_from_expr` is never called, so `opt`'s content doesn't matter.

Thus, the input `expr` must be `1` and `method` must be `'factor'`.
