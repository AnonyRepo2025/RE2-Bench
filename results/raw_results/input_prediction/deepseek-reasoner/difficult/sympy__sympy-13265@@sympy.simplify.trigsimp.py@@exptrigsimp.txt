The output is "1/(y*\"tanh(1)\")", which represents the expression \( \frac{1}{y \cdot \tanh(1)} \). The function `exptrigsimp` simplifies expressions involving exponentials and hyperbolic functions. 

1. **Identify target expression**: The output \( \frac{1}{y \cdot \tanh(1)} \) can be rewritten using identities:
   \[
   \tanh(1) = \frac{\sinh(1)}{\cosh(1)} = \frac{e^1 - e^{-1}}{e^1 + e^{-1}}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{1}{y \cdot \tanh(1)} = \frac{e^1 + e^{-1}}{y \cdot (e^1 - e^{-1})}
   \]

2. **Simulate simplification**:
   - The input expression \( \frac{e^1 + e^{-1}}{y \cdot (e^1 - e^{-1})} \) is processed by `exptrigsimp`.
   - The `exp_trig` function (applied via `bottom_up`) recognizes that \( e^1 + e^{-1} \) and \( e^1 - e^{-1} \) can be rewritten as \( 2\cosh(1) \) and \( 2\sinh(1) \) respectively, reducing operation count.
   - The expression simplifies to \( \frac{2\cosh(1)}{y \cdot 2\sinh(1)} = \frac{\cosh(1)}{y \cdot \sinh(1)} = \frac{1}{y \cdot \tanh(1)} \).
   - The hyperbolic functions are preserved in the output since no further simplification changes them.

3. **Verify with code logic**:
   - The transformation matches the `exp_trig` step, which minimizes operations by rewriting exponentials as hyperbolics.
   - The function `f` in `exptrigsimp` doesn't alter this form, as no exponential products match its patterns.
   - The final step checks for hyperbolics but leaves \( \tanh(1) \) unchanged.

Thus, the input expression is \( \frac{\exp(1) + \exp(-1)}{y \cdot (\exp(1) - \exp(-1))} \), represented as a string.
