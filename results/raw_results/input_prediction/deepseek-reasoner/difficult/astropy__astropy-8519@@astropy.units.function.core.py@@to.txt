The output is 100.0, which is the result of the `to` method. To achieve this:

1. The simplest path is when `other` equals `self.physical_unit`, triggering the first branch: `return self.to_physical(value)`. For the output to be 100.0, `self.to_physical(100.0)` must return 100.0. This is likely if the function unit is dimensionless and `to_physical` is the identity function.

2. Both `self.physical_unit` and `other` are set to `dimensionless_unscaled` (represented as an empty string unit) to ensure they match. The function unit is also dimensionless but represented in decomposed form (empty bases/powers, scale=1.0).

3. `value` is set to 100.0 directly since no conversion occurs in the first branch. `equivalencies` remains empty as it's unused.

4. Unit representations:
   - `_physical_unit` and `other`: Use `_names=[""]` for dimensionless.
   - `_function_unit`: Decomposed form with empty `_bases`/`_powers` and `_scale=1.0`.
   - Placeholder values (`__doc__`, `_hash`) are set generically.

This configuration ensures the first branch is taken, returning `value` unchanged.
