1. The output is a 1D array with 12 elements, containing a single non-zero value (2.15579371) at index 4. This indicates that the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm selected only one atom (feature) during execution.
2. The Gram matrix must be 12x12 since the output coefficient vector has length 12. To ensure atom 4 is selected first, we make Gram an identity matrix so that:
   - Atom 4 has the highest correlation with Xy
   - Other atoms have zero correlation
3. Xy must be a vector of length 12 with its maximum absolute value at index 4 (2.15579371) to ensure atom 4 is selected first.
4. n_nonzero_coefs=1 forces the algorithm to stop after selecting one atom, matching the single non-zero in the output.
5. tol and norms_squared are set to null since we're using n_nonzero_coefs for stopping condition.
6. copy_Xy=true ensures the input Xy isn't modified during execution.
7. The identity Gram matrix and specified Xy will produce exactly the output coefficients: zeros everywhere except index 4 (2.15579371).
