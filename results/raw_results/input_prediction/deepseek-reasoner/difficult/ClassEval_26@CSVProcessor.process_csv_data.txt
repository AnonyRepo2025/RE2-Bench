[THOUGHT]
The `process_csv_data` method returns 1 when the CSV processing and writing are successful. The output 1 indicates:
1. The input file (`save_file_name`) exists and is readable.
2. The column index `N` is valid for all rows in the CSV.
3. The output file (derived from `save_file_name`) is writable.

Given the output is 1, we need inputs that satisfy these conditions. Since no specific file or index is provided, we choose common valid values:
- `N = 0` (first column, likely to exist in most CSVs).
- `save_file_name = "data.csv"` (a common filename; assumed to exist with at least one data row and valid column index 0).

This ensures:
- Reading `data.csv` succeeds.
- Extracting column 0 from all rows works.
- Writing to `data_process.csv` succeeds, returning 1.
