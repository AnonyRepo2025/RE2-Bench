The output expression is "(-1 + \"sqrt(3)\"*I)*(\"sqrt(21)\" + 5)**(1/3)", which is a factored form. The function `factor_terms` factors out common terms from expressions. The output shows a product of a complex term and a cube root term. This suggests the input was likely an expanded form of this expression, specifically a sum of two terms sharing the common factor (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3).

Breaking down:
1. The output is equivalent to: (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) * (-1 + I*sqrt(3))
2. This can be expanded to: - (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) + I*sqrt(3)*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)
3. Thus, the input expression should be this expanded form: "- (sqrt(21)+5)**(1/3) + I*sqrt(3)*(sqrt(21)+5)**(1/3)"

When processed by `factor_terms`:
- The function identifies the common factor (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3) in the sum.
- It factors this out, resulting in the given output.
- The exponent 1/3 is represented as a rational number in the string, which `sympify` will parse correctly.

The input structure requires the expression as a string for the "expr" field, with no keyword arguments needed.
