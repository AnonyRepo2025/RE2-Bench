The output is an empty dictionary `{}` from the `get_many` method. This method iterates over a list of keys and returns a dictionary of key-value pairs for keys found in the cache. An empty output means none of the keys were found.

To achieve this:
1. The input keys must not exist in the cache. For `FileBasedCache` (indicated by the presence of `_dir` in the structure), this means the cache files for these keys don't exist in `_dir`.
2. The `self` attributes:
   - `default_timeout`, `_max_entries`, and `_cull_frequency` can be set to their defaults (300, 300, 3) as they don't affect key existence.
   - `key_prefix` and `version` are used in key construction. Set them to default values (empty string and 1) to keep keys simple.
   - `key_func` is not a placeholder, so leave it as `{}`.
   - `_dir` must be set to a directory path where the cache files would reside (e.g., `"/tmp/cache"`), and it should not contain files for the input keys.
3. The `args` should contain a list of keys (e.g., `["key1", "key2"]`) under the `"key"` field (as per structure).
4. The `kwargs` `version` can be set to `None` (using `self.version`) or explicitly to `1`. Either will result in the same key construction.

Thus, the input is configured to ensure all keys are missing from the cache.
