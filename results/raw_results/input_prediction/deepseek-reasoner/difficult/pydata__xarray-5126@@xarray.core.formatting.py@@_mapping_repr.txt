[THOUGHT]
The output string is "Attributes:\n    foo:      bar". This indicates:
1. The title is "Attributes", matching the first line.
2. There's one attribute with key "foo" and a value that formats to "bar".
3. The formatting "    foo:      bar" suggests:
   - 4-space indentation before the key
   - 6 spaces between the colon and value
   - The value representation is simply "bar"

Given the structure requirements:
- `mapping` must contain {"foo": XXX} where XXX should be a value that formats to "bar" (likely the string "bar" itself).
- `title` must be "Attributes" to match the output.
- `expand_option_name` must be "display_expand_attrs" because:
  - The `attrs_repr` partial function uses this option name
  - The output shows expanded attributes (non-empty representation)
- `summarizer` remains an empty object as per the structure, since the actual function is provided by the context.

The function flow:
1. `title="Attributes"` sets the header.
2. With one item in `mapping`, and `expand_option_name` likely returning `True` (to expand), it calls the summarizer.
3. The summarizer (for attributes) formats "foo:      bar" with fixed indentation and spacing.
