[THOUGHT]
The output shows `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` as `null` after calling `_expand_partial_derivative`. This occurs when the method returns `S.Zero` (a SymPy zero object), which happens when `args[0].free_symbols` is empty (i.e., the expression has no free symbols). In this case:
1. The method returns `S.Zero`, which is not a `TensExpr` and lacks the tensor attributes (`_indices`, `_free`, `_dum`), resulting in `null` when accessed.
2. The input `self` must be a `PartialDerivative` instance where `self.expr` (the first argument) has no free symbols (e.g., a constant like `0` or a number).
3. The attributes `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` of the input `self` can be any value (they are unused in the `S.Zero` branch), but must fit the structure. For simplicity, they are set to empty lists.

Thus, the input `self` has:
- `_indices`: `[]` (any value works, but empty list is reasonable)
- `_free`: `[]` (any value)
- `_dum`: `[]` (any value)
The method is called with no arguments (`args` and `kwargs` empty).
