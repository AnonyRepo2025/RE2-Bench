[THOUGHT]
The `check_winner` method scans the entire board for five consecutive identical symbols ('X' or 'O') in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions. Given the output is "O", the board must contain exactly one sequence of five 'O's in a row. 

To satisfy this:
1. The board must be at least 5x5 to accommodate five in a row.
2. A minimal 5x5 board is sufficient.
3. Place five 'O's horizontally in the first row.
4. The rest of the board can be empty (spaces).
5. When `check_winner` scans:
   - At (0,0), it checks horizontally (direction (0,1)):
     - (0,0) to (0,4) are all 'O's → count reaches 5 → returns True → winner is 'O'.
6. `current_player` is set to 'O' for consistency (though it doesn't affect the check).

Thus, the input uses:
- `board_size`: 5
- `board`: First row full of 'O's, other rows empty
- `current_player`: 'O'
