The output shows two code snippets extracted from the HTML. The `extract_code_from_html_text` method works by:
1. First processing the HTML with `format_line_html_text`, which replaces code blocks (tags: pre, blockquote) with `self.CODE_MARK` (default: '-CODE-').
2. Counting these markers to determine how many code blocks exist.
3. Using BeautifulSoup on the original HTML to extract the actual text content from all pre/blockquote tags.

Given the output contains two code strings, the input HTML must contain exactly two code blocks (pre or blockquote tags) with matching content:
- First block: "print('Hello, world!')"
- Second block: "for i in range(4):\n                print(i)"

The instance attributes (SPACE_MARK, CODE_MARK, etc.) use default values from `__init__` since the output doesn't suggest customization. The HTML input must preserve the newline and spaces in the second code block. The minimal HTML input would be two consecutive tags with the exact code content, in the order matching the output array.

Thus, the input HTML is:
```html
<pre>print('Hello, world!')</pre><blockquote>for i in range(4):\n                print(i)</blockquote>
```
