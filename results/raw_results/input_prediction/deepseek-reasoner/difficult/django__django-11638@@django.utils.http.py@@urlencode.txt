The output is "a=1&b=2&c=3", which is a URL-encoded string. The function `urlencode` processes the `query` argument as follows:

1. If `query` is a `MultiValueDict`, it converts it to a list of (key, value list) pairs using `.lists()`.
2. If `query` has an `items` method (like a dictionary), it uses `.items()` to get (key, value) pairs.
3. For each (key, value) pair:
   - If `value` is `None`, it raises an error.
   - If `doseq` is `False` (default) or `value` is a string/bytes, it treats `value` as a single value.
   - Otherwise, it iterates over `value` and collects each non-`None` item.

Given the output has no repeated keys and simple values, `query` should be a sequence of key-value pairs or a dictionary. Since the output order is "a", "b", "c", and dictionaries in Python 3.6+ preserve insertion order, a dictionary with keys inserted in that order would work. However, to ensure order compatibility across Python versions, a list of tuples is safer.

The values can be integers or strings, as `urlencode` converts non-string values to strings. Using integers is valid since they convert to "1", "2", "3". Thus, `query` should be `[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]` to guarantee the output order matches exactly.
