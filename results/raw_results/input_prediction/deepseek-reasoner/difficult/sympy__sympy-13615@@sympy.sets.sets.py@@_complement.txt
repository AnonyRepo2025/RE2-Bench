The output shows a `frozenset({10, 15})`, which is the `_elements` attribute of the resulting `FiniteSet` from the `_complement` method. The method's `FiniteSet` branch returns elements of `other` not in `self` (where `self.contains(el)` is `False`). For the result to be exactly `{10, 15}`, `other` must contain at least these elements, and `self` must not contain them (so they are included in the output). The simplest case is when `other` is exactly `{10, 15}`, and `self` is empty (or doesn't contain 10 or 15). Since the input structure only requires specifying `other._elements`, we set it to `frozenset({10, 15})` to match the output.
