The output is a list of two strings: ["3*t_0 - 5", "2*t_0 - 5"]. This represents the solution to a Diophantine equation in parametric form, where `t_0` is an integer parameter. 

From the `diop_solve` function, this output format matches the solution for a linear Diophantine equation with two variables. The solution expressions correspond to the values of two variables (say x and y) in terms of the parameter `t_0`:
- First variable: \( x = 3t_0 - 5 \)
- Second variable: \( y = 2t_0 - 5 \)

To reconstruct the original equation:
1. Eliminate the parameter \( t_0 \):
   - From \( x = 3t_0 - 5 \), solve for \( t_0 \): \( t_0 = \frac{x + 5}{3} \)
   - From \( y = 2t_0 - 5 \), substitute \( t_0 \): \( y = 2\left(\frac{x + 5}{3}\right) - 5 \)
2. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   y = \frac{2x + 10}{3} - 5 \implies 3y = 2x + 10 - 15 \implies 2x - 3y = 5
   \)
3. Rewrite in standard form (implicitly set to zero):
   \[
   2x - 3y - 5 = 0
   \)

Thus, the input equation should be \( 2x - 3y - 5 \). The variables `x` and `y` are chosen as they are common symbols, and their order (x first, y second) matches the sorted free symbols in `classify_diop` (via `default_sort_key`).

The input structure requires the equation as a string in the `eq` field of `args`. The `self` and `kwargs` are empty as per the structure.
