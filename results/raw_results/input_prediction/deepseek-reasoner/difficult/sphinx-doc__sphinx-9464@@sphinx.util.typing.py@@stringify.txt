[THOUGHT]
The output string "tests.test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\"" suggests that the annotation is a custom class or type defined in the "tests.test_util_typing" module. The function `stringify` processes annotations, and for non-builtin classes, it typically returns the module-qualified name. However, the presence of quotes around "<MyClass2>" indicates special handling, likely due to the class name containing special characters or being a forward reference.

Analyzing the code:
1. The annotation is not a string (first condition fails as it doesn't start/end with single quotes).
2. It's not a TypeVar, NewType, None, built-in, or Ellipsis.
3. Since Python version isn't specified, it uses either `_stringify_py37` or `_stringify_py36`, which handle complex types.
4. The output format matches how a class with a name containing angle brackets would be represented to avoid syntax issues.

Given the structure requires `__module__` and `__doc__`:
- `__module__` must be "tests.test_util_typing" to match the output prefix.
- `__doc__` can be null since it's unused in `stringify`.

The annotation object is likely a class defined as:
```python
class "<MyClass2>":
    __module__ = "tests.test_util_typing"
    __doc__ = None  # or any docstring; doesn't affect output
```
The quotes in the class name are part of its identifier, which is rare but valid if defined dynamically. The stringify function escapes them in the output.
