The output is a 1x1 array with value 1.1649954, which is the Euclidean distance between two vectors. Since the output is a single value, both X and Y should be 2D arrays with one row each (shape (1, n)). 

The value 1.1649954 can be achieved by setting:
- X = [[0.0]] and Y = [[1.1649954]] with squared=False, as the Euclidean distance between [0.0] and [1.1649954] is exactly 1.1649954.
- Alternatively, if squared=True, the squared Euclidean distance would be 1.1649954, requiring vectors like [[0.0]] and [[sqrt(1.1649954)]] â‰ˆ [[1.0793]]. However, using squared=False with direct values is simpler.

The function uses float32 computation when inputs are float32, but since JSON input passes lists (converted to float64 by default), the standard computation path will be used. The output value matches when printed with 8-digit precision.

Thus, the input is:
- X: [[0.0]] (1 sample, 1 feature)
- Y: [[1.1649954]] (1 sample, 1 feature)
- squared: false (to get Euclidean distance, not squared distance)
