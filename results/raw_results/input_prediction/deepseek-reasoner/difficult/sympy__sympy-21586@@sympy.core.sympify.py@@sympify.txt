[THOUGHT]
The output shows `_args_set` as a set containing two string elements: '2.00000000000000' and '3'. This suggests the input to `sympify` resulted in a SymPy expression with two arguments: a float (2.0) and an integer (3). 

Key observations:
1. The float is represented with high precision (14 decimal places), indicating it was parsed as a `Float` in SymPy.
2. The output is a set of string representations, meaning the expression must preserve both values as distinct arguments without simplification.
3. For this to happen:
   - The expression must be a container or operation that doesn't evaluate numerically (e.g., `FiniteSet` or `Tuple`).
   - Since `kwargs` is empty, `evaluate` uses the default (True), ruling out unevaluated operations like `Add(2.0, 3)` which would simplify to 5.0.
4. The only input that produces such an expression without evaluation is a string representing a set: `"{2.0, 3}"`. This parses to `FiniteSet(2.0, 3)`, whose arguments yield the exact string representations in the output when converted to a set.

Thus, the input `a` must be the string `"{2.0, 3}"`.
