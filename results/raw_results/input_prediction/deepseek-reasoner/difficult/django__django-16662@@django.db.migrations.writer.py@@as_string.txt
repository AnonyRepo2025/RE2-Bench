[THOUGHT]
The output shows a minimal migration file with:
- Only "from django.db import migrations" in imports
- Empty dependencies list
- Empty operations list
- No migration header
- No replaces or initial flags
- Class name is "Migration" (with quotes in output, likely a serialization artifact)

To produce this:
1. `include_header` must be False (no header in output)
2. `migration.operations` must be empty (no operations)
3. `migration.dependencies` would be empty (not in structure, but implied by output)
4. `migration.replaces` and `migration.initial` would be unset/False (not in structure)
5. `__module__` can be any string (not used in output)
6. `__doc__` can be None (not used)
7. `needs_manual_porting` must be False (no manual porting note in output)

The quoted class name in output ("Migration") appears to be a JSON serialization artifact and doesn't require special handling in input.
