[THOUGHT]
The output is {"output": "_x"}, which represents the symbol `_x`. The function `powdenest` simplifies expressions with nested powers. For the output to be the simple symbol `_x`, the input expression must be `_x` itself, as it has no nested powers to denest. 

The function has two main paths:
1. If `force=True`, it attempts aggressive denesting but would leave `_x` unchanged since it contains no `Pow` or `exp` terms.
2. If `force=False`, it uses `powsimp` and a transform, which also leaves `_x` unchanged.

However, passing `force=True` with a string input (like `"_x"`) would cause errors in the `force` branch (e.g., `eq.atoms(Pow, exp)` fails on strings). Thus, we set `force=False` to safely allow the string `"_x"` to be sympified to the symbol `_x`. Setting `polar=False` avoids unnecessary complex number handling. The input expression is represented as a string `"_x"` that sympifies to the symbol.

Thus, the input is:
- `eq`: `"_x"` (string representation of the symbol)
- `force`: `false` (to avoid processing issues)
- `polar`: `false` (no polar processing needed)
