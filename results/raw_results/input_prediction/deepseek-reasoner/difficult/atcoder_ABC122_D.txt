[THOUGHT]
The provided Python code implements a dynamic programming solution to count the number of valid DNA sequences of length `n` (composed of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T') that avoid the substring "AGC" and any sequence that can be transformed into "AGC" by swapping one pair of adjacent characters. The function `dfs` uses memoization to count valid sequences, starting from the initial state `'TTT'` (a dummy state for the first three characters). The function `ok` checks a 4-character window (the last three characters of the current state plus the new character) to ensure no forbidden patterns appear, even after considering adjacent swaps.

Given the output `719476260`, which matches the known solution for the DNA sequence problem (from AtCoder Grand Contest 015) for input `n = 100`, we can deduce that the input must be `100`. This is because:
- The problem is well-known, and the answer for `n = 100` is `719476260` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- The code structure aligns with the known solution, despite a potential typo in `' '.join(t)` (which should likely be `''.join(t)` to properly detect contiguous substrings). However, the output confirms the intended behavior for `n = 100`.
- For other values of `n`, the output would differ (e.g., `n = 0` gives `1`, `n = 1` gives `4`).

Thus, the input `n` is `100`.
