The output shows a sparse matrix representation with:
- Shape: [1, 7] (1 sample, 7 features)
- A single non-zero value at column index 4 (value 1.0)
- `indptr` [0, 1] indicates one non-zero entry in the first row
- `indices` [4] confirms the non-zero is at column 4

To achieve this output from `OneHotEncoder.transform`:
1. **Matrix Dimensions**: The 7 columns imply the cumulative sum of `n_values_` is 7. For simplicity, assume one categorical feature with `n_values_ = [7]` (allowing values 0-6).
2. **Single Non-zero**: The value 4 at column 4 suggests:
   - Input `X` contains [[4]] (one sample, value 4 for the categorical feature).
   - Since 4 < 7, it's within bounds and maps directly to column 4.
3. **Encoder Configuration**:
   - `n_values = 'auto'` to derive `n_values_` from training data.
   - `categorical_features = 'all'` (only one feature exists).
   - `dtype = np.float64` (output data is float).
   - `sparse = True` (output is sparse matrix).
   - `handle_unknown = 'ignore'` (no errors for out-of-bounds values).
   - `n_values_ = [7]` (max value in training was 6).
   - `feature_indices_ = [0, 7]` (cumulative sum of `n_values_`).
   - `active_features_ = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]` (all categories present in training when `n_values='auto'`).

This setup ensures:
- During `transform`, `X=[[4]]` is encoded as a 1x7 matrix with a single 1.0 at column 4.
- The sparse representation matches the output exactly.
