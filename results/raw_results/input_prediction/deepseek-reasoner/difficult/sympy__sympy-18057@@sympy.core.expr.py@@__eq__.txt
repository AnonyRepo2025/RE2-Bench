The output is `true`, meaning the `__eq__` method returned `True`. To achieve this:

1. The `__eq__` method first attempts to `_sympify` the `other` argument. If sympification fails, it returns `False`. Therefore, `other` must be sympifiable to an `Expr` object.

2. After sympification, the method checks if `other` is an instance of `Expr`. If not, it returns `False`. Thus, `other` must sympify to an `Expr`.

3. The method then checks if both `self` and `other` are numbers (`self.is_Number and other.is_Number`). If they are not numbers and their types differ, it returns `False`. For `True` output, either:
   - Both are numbers, or
   - They have the same type.

4. The `_hashable_content` of `self` and `other` must be equal. This content is derived from `self._args` and `other._args`.

5. Additionally, for any element in `_hashable_content` that is an `Expr` and a number, the corresponding element in the other must be of the same type.

Given the output is `True`, a simple case is when `self` and `other` are both the integer `1`. Here:
- `other = 1` sympifies to `Integer(1)`
- Both are numbers (`Integer` instances)
- `_hashable_content` for both is `(1,)`, which is equal
- The content `1` is an `Integer` (a number), and the types match

Thus, setting `other = 1` will produce the output `True`.
