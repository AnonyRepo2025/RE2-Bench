The output is `[ {}, null ]`, which represents a tuple where the first element is an empty dictionary and the second is `None`. The function `_construct_simple` returns such a tuple only in the algebraic branch (when `opt.extension` is `True` and algebraic coefficients are present without floats). Specifically:
1. For `opt.extension = True`, algebraic coefficients are allowed.
2. The coefficient `sqrt(2)` is algebraic (a number and algebraic).
3. During processing, `algebraics` is set to `True` when encountering `sqrt(2)`.
4. Since no floats are present, the function proceeds to `_construct_algebraic(coeffs, opt)`.
5. The output `[ {}, null ]` suggests that `_construct_algebraic` returns `({}, None)`, likely due to internal logic not provided, but matching the required output.

Thus, the input `coeffs` must include an algebraic expression like `"sqrt(2)"`, and `opt` must enable extension (handled externally). The empty `opt` in the structure is acceptable as a placeholder.
