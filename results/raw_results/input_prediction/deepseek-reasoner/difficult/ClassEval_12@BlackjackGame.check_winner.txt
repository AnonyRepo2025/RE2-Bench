[THOUGHT]
The output is "Player wins". The `check_winner` method determines the winner based on hand values. Possible scenarios for "Player wins" are:
1. Player ≤21 and dealer >21
2. Both >21 and player's value ≤ dealer's value
3. Both ≤21 and player's value > dealer's value

I'll choose scenario 1: dealer busts (value >21) while player doesn't. Example:
- Player hand: ['10H', '7D'] → 10+7 = 17 (valid)
- Dealer hand: ['10C', '5D', '7S'] → 10+5+7 = 22 (bust)

The `self` attributes aren't used in `check_winner`, so:
- `deck` can be empty (initialized but unused)
- `player_hand` and `dealer_hand` in `self` match the args for consistency
