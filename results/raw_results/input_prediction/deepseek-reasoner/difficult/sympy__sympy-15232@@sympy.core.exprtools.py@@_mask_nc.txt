1. The output shows a tuple with three elements: a string expression, null, and null.
2. The function `_mask_nc` returns a tuple `(expr, rep_dict, nc_syms)`.
3. The second element is `{v: k for k, v in rep} or None`. Since the output shows null, this indicates `rep` was empty, meaning no substitutions occurred.
4. The third element `nc_syms` is a list of non-commutative symbols. The output shows null, implying an empty list was serialized as null in this context.
5. For no substitutions to occur, the input expression must be commutative (no non-commutative parts found during traversal).
6. The output expression is `"x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n"`, which is commutative since SymPy symbols are commutative by default.
7. Therefore, the input expression must be the commutative expression represented by the string `"x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n"`.
8. In JSON input, we represent the expression as a string matching the output format.

Thus, the input `eq` is `"x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n"`.
