[THOUGHT]
The output is "32", which is the string representation of the number thirty-two. The `text2int` method converts words representing numbers into their numerical string form. For the output "32", the input must be a string that represents the number 32, such as "thirty two" or "thirty-two". The code replaces hyphens with spaces, so both forms are equivalent. 

Simulating the conversion:
- "thirty" is in `numwords` with value (1, 30), so `current` becomes 30.
- "two" is in `numwords` with value (1, 2), so `current` becomes 30 * 1 + 2 = 32.
- The method returns the string representation "32".

The `self` part reflects the initial state from `__init__`:
- `numwords` contains mappings for number words, with tuples represented as lists in JSON.
- `units` is the list of unit words.
- `tens` includes two empty strings at the start, with the second setting `''` to (1,10).
- `scales` is the list of scale words.
- `ordinal_words` maps ordinal words to their numerical values.
- `ordinal_endings` is a list of lists for converting ordinal endings.

The input `textnum` is "thirty two" to produce the output "32".
