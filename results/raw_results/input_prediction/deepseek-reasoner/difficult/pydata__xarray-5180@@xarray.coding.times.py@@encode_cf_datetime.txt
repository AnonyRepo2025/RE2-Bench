[THOUGHT]
1. The output is `["10", "days since 2000-01-01", "gregorian"]`, which corresponds to the return values `(num, units, calendar)` from `encode_cf_datetime`.
2. The number "10" (converted to an integer 10) represents the encoded time value. This suggests the input date is 10 days after the reference date in the units.
3. The units are "days since 2000-01-01", meaning the reference date is 2000-01-01. Adding 10 days gives the date 2000-01-11.
4. The calendar is "gregorian", which is a standard calendar. This must be explicitly passed since the default for datetime64 arrays would be "proleptic_gregorian".
5. The function has two paths:
   - The first path uses pandas/numpy for standard calendars and datetime64 arrays.
   - The fallback path uses cftime for non-standard calendars or object arrays.
6. Since the output uses a standard calendar ("gregorian") and the number is an integer, the first path was likely taken. This requires:
   - `dates` to be a datetime64 array (not object array).
   - Explicit `units="days since 2000-01-01"` and `calendar="gregorian"` arguments.
7. If `units` were not provided, `infer_datetime_units` would set the reference date to the first date (2000-01-11) and infer units as "seconds" (since there's only one date), which doesn't match the output.
8. If `calendar` were not provided, it would default to "proleptic_gregorian" for datetime64 arrays, which doesn't match the output "gregorian".
9. Thus, both `units` and `calendar` must be explicitly passed as in the output.
10. The input `dates` should be an array containing the date 2000-01-11. Represented as a string in ISO format for JSON compatibility.

Predicted input:
- `dates`: ["2000-01-11"] (single date)
- `units`: "days since 2000-01-01"
- `calendar`: "gregorian"
