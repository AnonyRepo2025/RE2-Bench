The output of `_get_kernel_params` is a dictionary containing only "coef0" and "degree" with values 0.1 and 3.1. This indicates:

1. The kernel must be a string type (not callable or 'precomputed'), otherwise the function would raise a ValueError if coef0/degree were set.
2. The kernel type must require both "coef0" and "degree" parameters. The polynomial kernel ('poly') is the only standard kernel that uses both.
3. "gamma" is absent from the output, meaning `self.gamma` must be None (so it wasn't added to params).
4. `self.kernel_params` must be None or an empty dict to avoid extra keys in the output. We use None for consistency with initialization defaults.
5. Other attributes like `normalization_` are unused in this method and can be set to null.

Thus, the input configuration is:
- `kernel`: 'poly' (triggers parameter handling for coef0/degree)
- `gamma`: null (omitted from output)
- `coef0`: 0.1, `degree`: 3.1 (directly from output)
- `kernel_params`: null (to ensure clean output dict)
- Unused attributes: null (they don't affect the method)
