To achieve an output of 2 from `contravariant_order(expr)`, we need to construct an expression `expr` that evaluates to 2 based on the function's logic. The function processes different expression types:

1. For `TensorProduct`, it returns the sum of `contravariant_order` of its arguments.
2. `BaseVectorField` returns 1.
3. Other types like `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow` either return 0, cause errors, or have constraints that don't directly yield 2.

Given this:
- A `TensorProduct` of two `BaseVectorField` objects would return 1 + 1 = 2.
- Using more than two `BaseVectorField` would exceed 2, while fewer would be less.
- Alternatives like `Add` or `Mul` are unsuitable: `Add` requires uniform orders (e.g., summing two `TensorProduct` of order 2 each would work but is more complex), and `Mul` errors with multiple non-zero orders.

Thus, the simplest solution is a `TensorProduct` with exactly two `BaseVectorField` arguments. The expression structure must be represented in JSON, using `__class__` to denote types and `args` for nested components. This ensures the recursive logic computes 2 correctly.
