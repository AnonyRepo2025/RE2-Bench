[THOUGHT]
The output is an array of edges at change points: [4.36037718, 48.45689469, 52.59791734, 99.45505108]. These edges are derived from the input `t` array through the `fit` method's processing. 

Key observations:
1. The edges are computed as: 
   - First edge = first element of `t`
   - Middle edges = midpoints between consecutive `t` values
   - Last edge = last element of `t`
2. The output has 4 edges, meaning the change points selected by the algorithm correspond to 4 positions in the edges array.
3. To match the output:
   - The first edge (4.36037718) must be the first element of `t`.
   - The second edge (48.45689469) must be the midpoint between the first and second elements of `t`.
   - The third edge (52.59791734) must be the midpoint between the second and third elements of `t`.
   - The fourth edge (99.45505108) must be the last element of `t`.
4. Solving for `t`:
   - Let \( t_0 = 4.36037718 \)
   - \( (t_0 + t_1)/2 = 48.45689469 \) → \( t_1 = 2 \times 48.45689469 - 4.36037718 = 92.5534122 \)
   - \( (t_1 + t_2)/2 = 52.59791734 \) → \( t_2 = 2 \times 52.59791734 - 92.5534122 = 12.64242248 \)
   - \( t_3 = 99.45505108 \) (last edge)
5. Thus, \( t = [4.36037718, 92.5534122, 12.64242248, 99.45505108] \). The algorithm does not require sorted input, as the output edges match the unsorted midpoints.
6. For `x` and `sigma`:
   - They are used in cumulative sums if `_fitness_args` requires them, but aren't in the output.
   - Set to arrays of ones (same length as `t`) for simplicity.
7. For `self` attributes:
   - `ncp_prior` is set to 0 to avoid calling `compute_ncp_prior`.
   - `p0` and `gamma` are unused in the provided code, so set to `null`.

This input configuration produces the exact output edges when the algorithm selects change points at indices [0, 1, 2, 4] of the edges array.
