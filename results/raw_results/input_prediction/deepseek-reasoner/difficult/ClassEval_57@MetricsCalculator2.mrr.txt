The output is [0.25, [0.25]], which matches the return value of the `mrr` method when processing input data. The method can handle two input types:
1. A single tuple `(sub_list, total_num)`
2. A list of tuples `[(sub_list, total_num), ...]`

The output structure shows a single MRR value (0.25) and a list with one element ([0.25]), indicating either:
- A single tuple input where the first positive value in `sub_list` is at position 4 (index 3), giving MRR = 1/4 = 0.25
- A list with one tuple where the tuple produces MRR = 0.25

Since JSON doesn't distinguish between tuples and lists, we represent the input as a list to ensure compatibility. The minimal representation uses:
- `sub_list = [0, 0, 0, 1]` (0s until the 4th position, then 1)
- `total_num = 4` (non-zero, as required)

This input produces:
- `ranking_array = [1.0, 0.5, 0.333, 0.25]`
- `mr_np = [0, 0, 0, 0.25]`
- First positive value = 0.25 → MRR = 0.25

For the list branch, input `data = [[[0,0,0,1], 4]]` yields:
- One element in the list → `separate_result = [0.25]`
- Mean = 0.25
- Return value = (0.25, [0.25]), matching the output.

Thus, the input data is represented as a list containing one tuple (as a nested list).
