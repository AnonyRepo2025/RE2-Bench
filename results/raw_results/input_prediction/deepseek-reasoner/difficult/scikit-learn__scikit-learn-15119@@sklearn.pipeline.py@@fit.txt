The output shows the state after calling the `fit` method, with:
- `"steps": null`
- `"memory": null`
- `"verbose": false`

This indicates:
1. `verbose` is `false` in both input and output since `fit` doesn't modify it.
2. `steps` and `memory` remain `null` after `fit`, meaning they were `null` before `fit` and weren't modified. This happens when the pipeline/union has no transformers (empty `steps`), so `fit` exits early without changes.
3. `X` and `y` can be any values (e.g., `null`) since the output doesn't depend on them when there are no transformers.

Thus, the input should have:
- `self.steps = null`
- `self.memory = null`
- `self.verbose = false`
- `X = null` (placeholder)
- `y = null` (placeholder)
