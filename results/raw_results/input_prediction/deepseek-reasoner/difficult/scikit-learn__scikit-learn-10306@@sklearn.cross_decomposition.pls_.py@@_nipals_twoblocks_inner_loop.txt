The output shows:
- x_weights as a 3x1 vector: [[-0.01672891], [0.91984997], [-0.39191157]]
- y_weights as a 2x1 vector: [[1.00000000e+00], [2.07317191e-08]]
- Iteration count: 4

From this:
1. **Dimensions**: x_weights has 3 elements, so input `X` must have 3 features (columns). y_weights has 2 elements, so input `Y` must have 2 features. Both must have the same number of samples (rows). The scikit-learn test data for PLS (corkindataset) matches these dimensions: X is 4x3, Y is 4x2.
2. **Iteration count**: The output shows 4 iterations, which matches the behavior when using the corkindataset. The default `max_iter=500` and `tol=1e-06` are sufficient.
3. **Mode**: Default 'A' is used, as 'B' (pseudoinverse mode) isn't indicated.
4. **norm_y_weights**: Default `False` is used, as y_weights isn't normalized beyond the algorithm's inherent steps.
5. **Specific data**: The corkindataset values (X and Y) are known to produce this output in scikit-learn tests.

Thus, the input uses:
- `X`: Corkindataset X values (4 samples, 3 features)
- `Y`: Corkindataset Y values (4 samples, 2 features)
- Other parameters: Defaults (mode='A', max_iter=500, tol=1e-06, norm_y_weights=False)
