[THOUGHT]
The output is "50", which is the string representation of the integer 50. The `simplify` function processes expressions and returns simplified forms. Given that the output is a constant integer, the input expression must simplify to 50. The simplest valid input is the integer 50 itself. When passed to `simplify`, it undergoes `sympify(50)`, which converts it to a SymPy Integer object. Since 50 is already simplified, no further transformations occur, and it is returned as the integer 50, whose string representation is "50". The input structure requires the expression under `args["expr"]`, so we set it to 50. The `self` and `kwargs` remain empty as the function is not bound to an instance and no keyword arguments are used.
