The output is `":py:obj:`None`"`, which comes from the first branch in `restify()` that checks `if cls is None or cls is NoneType`. This branch returns `':py:obj:`None`'` when either:
1. `cls` is the `None` singleton, or
2. `cls` is the `NoneType` class (type of `None`)

In JSON, we represent:
- `None` as `null`
- `NoneType` isn't directly representable in JSON and would require a complex structure, but since `None` also triggers the same output and is simpler, we use `null`.

Other branches don't match:
- `Ellipsis` would return `'...'`
- A string input would return the string itself
- NewType or other types would return different representations

Thus, the simplest valid input is `cls = None` â†’ `null` in JSON.
