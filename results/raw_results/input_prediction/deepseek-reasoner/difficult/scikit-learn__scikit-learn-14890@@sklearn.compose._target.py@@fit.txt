[THOUGHT]
1. **Understanding Output Structure**: The output shows the state of the `TransformedTargetRegressor` after calling `fit`. Key attributes include:
   - `regressor` is a `LinearRegression` with specific parameters (fit_intercept=true, etc.).
   - `transformer` is `null`, indicating the function-based transformer was used.
   - `func` is `"<function sqrt>"` and `inverse_func` is `"<function log>"`.
   - `check_inverse` is `true`.
   - `_training_dim` is 1, meaning `y` was 1D.
   - `transformer_` is a `FunctionTransformer` with the same functions.
   - `regressor_` is a fitted `LinearRegression` with 10 coefficients, indicating `X` has 10 features.

2. **Regressor Input**:
   - The output's `regressor` matches default `LinearRegression` parameters. Since the code uses `LinearRegression()` when `regressor=None`, the input `regressor` must be `None`. However, the output shows a dictionary, so we represent it as such in the input structure.

3. **Transformer Functions**:
   - `transformer` is `null`, so `func` and `inverse_func` must be set. The output shows `"<function sqrt>"` and `"<function log>"`, so these strings are used directly in the input.

4. **Data Requirements for `X` and `y`**:
   - `regressor_` has 10 coefficients, so `X` must have 10 features.
   - `_training_dim=1` implies `y` is 1D.
   - To produce the exact coefficients, generate synthetic data:
     - Let `X` be a 10x10 identity matrix (ensures full rank).
     - Compute `y_trans = X @ beta + intercept` (using coefficients from output).
     - Since `func=sqrt`, set `y = y_trans**2` (inverse of transformation during fit).

5. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - `beta = [0.66831236, 0.88151655, 0.0896103, 1.69534334, 0.66810795, -0.22097491, 0.00907926, 0.02448389, -0.10621791, -0.10341338]`
   - `intercept = 1.9022401109532499`
   - For each sample `i` (row in `X`), `y_trans_i = beta[i] + intercept`
   - Then `y_i = (y_trans_i)**2`

6. **Check Inverse Warning**:
   - The functions `sqrt` and `log` are not inverses, so `_fit_transformer` would warn. However, the output doesn't include warnings (they are not part of the state), so this is acceptable.

7. **Final Input Structure**:
   - `self.regressor`: Dictionary with `LinearRegression` params.
   - `self.transformer`: `null`.
   - `self.func/inverse_func`: Strings as in output.
   - `X`: 10x10 identity matrix.
   - `y`: List of 10 elements, each computed as `(beta[i] + intercept)**2`.
