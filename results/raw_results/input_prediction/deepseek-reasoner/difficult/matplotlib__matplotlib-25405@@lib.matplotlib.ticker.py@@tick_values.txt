The output shows tick values [0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000], which are powers of 10 from 10⁻¹ to 10⁴. This indicates:
1. The logarithmic base (`_base`) must be 10, as ticks are at decade intervals.
2. The absence of sub-ticks (e.g., 2, 3, ..., 20, 30, etc.) suggests `_subs` is set to [1.0], meaning only major ticks at whole decades are generated.
3. The range spans 5 decades (from 10⁻¹ to 10⁴, calculated as floor(log₁₀(10000)) - ceil(log₁₀(0.1)) = 4 - (-1) = 5), so `numdecs` is 5.
4. `numticks` is "auto", which defaults to 9 ticks when no axis is present. This leads to a stride of 1 in decade calculation (since 5 // 9 + 1 = 1).
5. The exact tick sequence requires `vmin = 0.1` and `vmax = 10000`. The function generates ticks from 10⁻² to 10⁵ initially, but `raise_if_exceeds` filters to the range [0.1, 10000], yielding the output.

Thus, the input parameters are:
- `_base`: 10
- `_subs`: [1.0]
- `numdecs`: 5
- `numticks`: "auto"
- `vmin`: 0.1
- `vmax`: 10000.0
