[THOUGHT]
The method `check_in` returns `null` (None) in two scenarios:
1. When the room_type exists in booked_rooms but the name is not found for that room type.
2. When the room_type exists, the name is found, and room_number is <= the booked count (then it modifies the booking without returning).

Given the structure, `booked_rooms` only has "single" with an empty dict. So:
- room_type must be "single" (only existing key).
- The empty dict means no names are booked, so the name provided won't be found.
Thus, the method will skip the inner logic and return None (outputting null).

Available_rooms and name are unused in the method, so they can be arbitrary. We'll use:
- Hotel name: "Grand Plaza" (arbitrary)
- Available rooms: single=10, double=5 (arbitrary numbers)
- Args: room_type="single", room_number=1 (arbitrary), name="Alex" (arbitrary, not in empty dict)
