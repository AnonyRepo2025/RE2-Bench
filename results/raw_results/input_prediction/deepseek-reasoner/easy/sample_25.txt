The function `f(d)` creates a copy of the input dictionary `d`, removes the last inserted item using `popitem()`, and returns the modified dictionary. The output is `{"l": 1, "t": 2}`, meaning after removal, the dictionary contains these two key-value pairs.

Given the input structure:
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "d": {
            "l": XXX,
            "t": XXX,
            "x:": XXX
        }
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
The keys are specified as `"l"`, `"t"`, and `"x:"` in that order. The output shows that `"l"` and `"t"` remain with values 1 and 2, so the removed item must be `"x:"`. Since `popitem()` removes the last inserted item (in Python 3.7+), the insertion order must be `"l"` → `"t"` → `"x:"`.

The values for `"l"` and `"t"` are directly from the output: 1 and 2. The value for `"x:"` is arbitrary because it is removed and does not affect the output. I'll use 0 as a placeholder value.

Thus, the input dictionary `d` must be:
```
{
    "l": 1,
    "t": 2,
    "x:": 0
}
```
