The function `f(s1, s2)` counts occurrences of substring `s2` in `s1` starting from position 1. The loop runs while `position > 0`. For each iteration:
1. It searches for `s2` in `s1` starting at `position`.
2. If found, `position` is updated to the found index + 1, and `count` increments.
3. If not found, `position` becomes -1 + 1 = 0, breaking the loop, but `count` is still incremented.

The output is 2, meaning the loop ran twice:
- First iteration: found an occurrence (count=1), then `position` updated.
- Second iteration: no occurrence found (count=2), loop breaks.

Thus, there must be exactly one occurrence of `s2` in `s1` at or after position 1. For example:
- `s1 = "ab"`, `s2 = "b"`:
  - Start at position 1: find "b" at index 1 → count=1, position=1+1=2.
  - Next, start at position 2: no "b" found → count=2, position=-1+1=0 → break → return 2.
