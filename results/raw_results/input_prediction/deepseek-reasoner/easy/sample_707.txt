The function `f` takes a string `text` and an integer `position`. It calculates an index as `position % (len(text) + 1)`. If `position` is negative or the index is negative, it sets the index to -1. Then, it converts `text` to a list, removes the character at the computed index, and joins the list back into a string.

Given the output is "udbs l" (6 characters), the original `text` must have been 7 characters long (since one character is removed). The output does not specify which character was removed, so multiple inputs are possible. 

After simulating possible cases:
- If `position` is negative, the index is set to -1, removing the last character. For example, if `text` is "udbs lx", removing the last character 'x' gives "udbs l".
- The output "udbs l" is achieved by removing the last character of "udbs lx" when `position = -1`.

Thus, a valid input is `text = "udbs lx"` and `position = -1`.
