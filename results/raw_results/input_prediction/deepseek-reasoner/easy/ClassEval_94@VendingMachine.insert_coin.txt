The `insert_coin` method adds the given `amount` to the current `balance` and returns the new balance. The output is 6.25, which is the balance after the insertion. 

The `__init__` method initializes `balance` to 0. Since the structure specifies `inventory` as empty (consistent with initialization) and doesn't indicate prior operations, we assume the machine starts in its initial state. Thus, the initial `balance` is 0. 

To achieve an output of 6.25:
- Initial balance: 0
- Amount inserted: 6.25
- New balance: 0 + 6.25 = 6.25

This matches the given output. The `kwargs` is empty as the method doesn't use keyword arguments.
