The output is 3.141592653589793, which is approximately π. The method calculates the area of an annulus using the formula: π * (outer_radius² - inner_radius²). For this to equal π, the equation must be:

π * (outer_radius² - inner_radius²) = π  
→ outer_radius² - inner_radius² = 1

The simplest solution is inner_radius = 0 and outer_radius = 1, as:
1² - 0² = 1

The instance variable `self.radius` is not used in the method `calculate_annulus_area`, so its value does not affect the output. Since the output doesn't constrain it, we can choose any value; 0 is used for simplicity.

Thus, the input is:
- `self.radius`: 0 (arbitrary, not used)
- `inner_radius`: 0
- `outer_radius`: 1
