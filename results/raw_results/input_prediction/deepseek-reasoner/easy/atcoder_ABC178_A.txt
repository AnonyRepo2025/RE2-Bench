[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer input `x`. If `x` is 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 1. The given output is 1, meaning the else branch was executed. Therefore, the input must not be 1. Any integer except 1 would produce this output. For simplicity, we choose 0 as the input value. Thus, the input string should be "0".
