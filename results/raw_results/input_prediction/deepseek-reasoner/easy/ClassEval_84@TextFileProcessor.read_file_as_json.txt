[THOUGHT]
The `read_file_as_json` method reads a JSON file from the given `file_path` and returns the parsed content. The output is `12345`, which is an integer. For `json.load(file)` to return `12345`, the file must contain the string `12345` (without quotes) as valid JSON. The actual file path is not specified in the output, so I assume a common filename like `data.json` that would contain this content. The method has no arguments or keyword arguments, so `args` and `kwargs` remain empty.
