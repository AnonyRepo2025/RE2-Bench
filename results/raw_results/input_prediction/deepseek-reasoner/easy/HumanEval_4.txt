The function `mean_absolute_deviation` calculates the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The output is given as approximately 0.666..., which equals 2/3. To find an input list that produces this output:

1. The MAD formula is:
   - Mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
   - MAD = sum(|x - mean| for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

2. The output 2/3 suggests a simple solution with 3 elements:
   - For a list of 3 integers, the sum of absolute deviations must be 2 to get MAD = 2/3.
   - A list like [1, 2, 3] works:
     - Mean = (1+2+3)/3 = 2
     - Absolute deviations: |1-2|=1, |2-2|=0, |3-2|=1 → Sum = 2
     - MAD = 2/3 ≈ 0.666...

3. Verification:
   - Using [1, 2, 3] in the function yields exactly 2/3 (0.666...), matching the output.

Thus, the input list is [1, 2, 3].
