[THOUGHT]
The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` and returns `n` squared (`n ** 2`). Given the output is 64, we need to find an integer `n` such that `n ** 2 = 64`. Solving this equation gives two solutions: `n = 8` and `n = -8`. 

Considering the context of the function name "car_race_collision", `n` likely represents a non-negative quantity (e.g., number of cars), so we choose the positive solution `n = 8`. 

Verification:  
- Input: `n = 8`  
- Output: `8 ** 2 = 64` (matches given output)  

Thus, the input value for `n` is 8.
