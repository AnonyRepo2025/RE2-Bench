[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` returns the string 'x0' repeated `n` times, where `n` is the index of the first occurrence of '8' in `text`. The output is "x0x0", which is two repetitions of 'x0', so `n` must be 2. Therefore, `text.find('8')` must return 2. This means the first '8' in `text` must be at index 2 (0-based). The string `text` must be at least 3 characters long, with the first two characters not being '8', and the third character being '8'. A simple valid input is "aa8", where:
- Index 0: 'a' (not '8')
- Index 1: 'a' (not '8')
- Index 2: '8' (first occurrence)

Thus, the input `text` is "aa8".
