[THOUGHT]
The `__delitem__` method deletes an item from `self._data` using the key converted by `_convert_key`. The output is `null` (None), which indicates the deletion was successful (no exception raised). For deletion to succeed, the converted key must exist in `self._data`. However, the input structure specifies `self._data` as an empty dictionary `{}`, which creates a contradiction since an empty dictionary has no keys to delete.

Given the constraints:
- The structure requires `self._data` to be empty.
- The output is None, implying successful deletion.
- The only way to avoid a `KeyError` is if the key (after conversion) exists in `self._data`.

This scenario is impossible with an empty `_data` dictionary. After considering alternatives, the only logical resolution is that the key must be a non-string (so `_convert_key` returns it unchanged) and that this non-string key exists in `self._data`. However, since `self._data` is empty, no key can exist. 

Re-examining the problem, the output being None doesn't provide information about the key, and the structure forces an empty `_data`. The only consistent approach is to assume the key is a placeholder like `"example"` (though deletion would fail in reality). Given the instructions to fill `XXX` and maintain the structure, a string key is chosen arbitrarily, acknowledging the inherent contradiction.
