[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` uses `text.rpartition('0')` to split the text into three parts: the part before the last occurrence of '0', the '0' itself, and the part after. The output "2:0" comes from the return value `f'{len(l[0])}:{l[2].find('0') + 1}'`.

Breaking down the output:
- The first part "2" means `len(l[0]) = 2`, so the substring before the last '0' has length 2.
- The second part "0" means `l[2].find('0') + 1 = 0`. Since `find()` returns -1 if '0' is not found, this implies `l[2].find('0') = -1`, so the part after the last '0' contains no '0's.

Additionally, the condition `if l[2] == ''` returns '-1:-1', but here the output is "2:0", so `l[2]` must be non-empty.

Therefore, the input text must:
1. Contain at least one '0' (so `rpartition` finds a separator).
2. Have exactly 2 characters before the last '0'.
3. Have a non-empty substring after the last '0' that contains no '0's.

A suitable input is "ab0cd":
- `rpartition('0')` splits it into `('ab', '0', 'cd')`.
- `l[0] = 'ab'` has length 2.
- `l[2] = 'cd'` contains no '0', so `'cd'.find('0')` returns -1, and `-1 + 1 = 0`.
- Thus, the output is "2:0".

Other inputs like "xy0z" or "aa0bb" would also work, but "ab0cd" is a valid example.
