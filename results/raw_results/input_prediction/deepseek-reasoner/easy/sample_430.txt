[THOUGHT]
The function `f(arr1, arr2)` creates a copy of `arr1` and extends it with `arr2`, effectively returning the concatenation of the two lists. The output is `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`, which must be the result of `arr1 + arr2`. Since the function does not modify the elements or impose any constraints on the split between `arr1` and `arr2`, any split of the output list into two contiguous parts would be valid. However, to choose a specific split, I note that the last element is an empty list (`[]`), which could logically be a standalone element in `arr2`. I split the output such that `arr1` contains the first 8 elements and `arr2` contains the last element (the empty list). This yields:
- `arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1]`
- `arr2 = [[]]`

Verification:
- `new_arr = arr1.copy()` â†’ `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1]`
- `new_arr.extend(arr2)` appends the elements of `arr2` (which is `[[]]`), resulting in `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`, matching the output.
