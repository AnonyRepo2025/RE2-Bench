[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes two arguments: `text` and `chars`. It performs the following steps:
1. If `chars` is non-empty, it strips trailing characters in `chars` from `text` using `text.rstrip(chars)`.
2. If `chars` is empty, it strips trailing spaces using `text.rstrip(' ')`.
3. If the resulting text is an empty string, it returns '-'.
4. Otherwise, it returns the stripped text.

Given the output is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.", which is non-empty and not '-', the input `text` after stripping must equal this output.

To achieve this:
- The input `text` must start with "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.".
- If `chars` is non-empty, any trailing characters in `text` that are in `chars` must be stripped to leave the output. However, the output ends with a period ('.'), so if `chars` includes '.', the input `text` would need extra trailing periods to be stripped, but the output does not indicate any stripped characters.
- The simplest case is that no stripping occurred because the input `text` had no trailing characters to remove. This happens if:
  - `chars` is empty: The function strips trailing spaces, but the output has no trailing spaces, so `text` remains unchanged.
  - `chars` is non-empty but does not include the last character ('.') or any trailing characters in `text`, so no stripping occurs.

Choosing the minimal input:
- Set `text` to the output string "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.".
- Set `chars` to an empty string to ensure no change during stripping (since there are no trailing spaces).

This satisfies:
- `chars` is empty → use `text.rstrip(' ')` → no trailing spaces to strip → text remains "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.".
- The text is not empty, so it is returned as-is.

Thus, the input values are:
- `text`: "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."
- `chars`: ""
