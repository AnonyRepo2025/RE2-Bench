[THOUGHT]
The function `f(array, elem)` returns the index of `elem` in `array` if found, otherwise -1. The output is 0, meaning:
1. `elem` must be present in `array` (since -1 isn't returned)
2. The first occurrence of `elem` must be at index 0
3. Therefore, `array` must have at least one element, and `array[0]` must equal `elem`

The simplest valid input is an array where the first (and only) element is `elem`. For example:
- `array = ["a"]` and `elem = "a"` would return 0
- This satisfies all conditions: `"a"` is in the array, and its index is 0

Other valid inputs exist (e.g., `array = [10, 20]`, `elem = 10`), but the single-element case is the minimal solution that matches the output.
