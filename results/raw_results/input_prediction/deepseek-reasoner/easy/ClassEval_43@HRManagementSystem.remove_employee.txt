[THOUGHT]
The `remove_employee` method returns `True` if the `employee_id` exists in `self.employees` and is successfully removed, otherwise it returns `False`. The given output is `false`, indicating the employee was not found. Therefore, the input `employee_id` must not exist in `self.employees`. 

The input structure specifies that `self.employees` contains an employee with ID "1". To ensure `remove_employee` returns `false`, the `employee_id` passed must be different from "1" (e.g., "2"). The content of the employee record (name, position, etc.) does not affect the outcome since only the existence of the ID matters. Arbitrary valid values can be used for the employee details.

Thus:
- `self.employees`: Keep the employee with ID "1" and fill placeholders with example values.
- `args.employee_id`: Set to "2" (a non-existent ID).
- `kwargs`: Remain empty as per structure.
