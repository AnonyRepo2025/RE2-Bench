[THOUGHT]
The `write_excel` method writes data to an Excel file and returns 1 on success. The output is 1, indicating the operation succeeded. For the operation to succeed:
1. `data` must be a list of lists (or compatible iterable) that `openpyxl` can process
2. `file_name` must be a valid writable filename string
3. The program must have write permissions to the target location

Since the output doesn't specify file contents or name, any valid inputs that meet these conditions would produce output 1. I'll choose typical valid values:
- `data`: `[["ID", "Name"], [1, "Alice"], [2, "Bob"]]` (2D data structure)
- `file_name`: `"output.xlsx"` (common Excel filename)

These inputs will:
- Create a workbook with 3 rows of data
- Save successfully as "output.xlsx"
- Return 1 (success code)
