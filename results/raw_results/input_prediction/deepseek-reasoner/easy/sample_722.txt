[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` processes each character in the input string:
- Uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.
- Non-uppercase characters (including lowercase and non-alphabetic) are converted to uppercase.

Given the output `",WpZpPPDL/"`, we can reverse the transformation:
- `,` is non-alphabetic → remains `,` in input.
- `W` is uppercase in output → was lowercase `w` in input.
- `p` is lowercase in output → was uppercase `P` in input.
- `Z` is uppercase → was `z`.
- `p` is lowercase → was `P`.
- `P` is uppercase → was `p`.
- `P` is uppercase → was `p`.
- `D` is uppercase → was `d`.
- `L` is uppercase → was `l`.
- `/` is non-alphabetic → remains `/`.

Thus, the input string is `",wPzPppdl/"`. Verification:
- `,` (non-upper) → `,` (uppercased remains `,`)
- `w` (non-upper) → `W`
- `P` (upper) → `p`
- `z` (non-upper) → `Z`
- `P` (upper) → `p`
- `p` (non-upper) → `P`
- `p` (non-upper) → `P`
- `d` (non-upper) → `D`
- `l` (non-upper) → `L`
- `/` (non-upper) → `/`
Result: `",WpZpPPDL/"` matches the given output.
