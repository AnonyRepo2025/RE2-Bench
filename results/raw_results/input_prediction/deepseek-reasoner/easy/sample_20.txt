[THOUGHT]
The function `f(text)` reverses the input string `text` by iterating from the last character to the first and appending each character to `result`. The output is the reversed string.

Given output: `",saw"`
- This is the reversed version of the original input.
- To find the original input, reverse the output: 
  - `",saw"` reversed is `"was,"` (since reversing order: 
    last char `"` → `w` → `a` → `s` → `,` → first char `"`).

Verification:
- If input is `"was,"`, reversing it: 
  - Start with `,` (last char) → `s` → `a` → `w` → `"` (first char) → `",saw"`.
- This matches the given output.

Thus, the input `text` must be `"was,"`.
