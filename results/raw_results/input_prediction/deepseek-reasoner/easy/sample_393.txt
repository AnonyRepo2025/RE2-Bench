The function `f` processes the input string `text` as follows:
1. Reverses `text` to get `ls`.
2. Initializes an empty string `text2`.
3. Iterates over indices from `len(ls)-3` down to 0 (exclusive) in steps of -3.
4. For each index `i`, takes the slice `ls[i:i+3]`, joins the characters with '---', appends the result to `text2` followed by '---'.
5. Returns `text2` with the last three characters (trailing '---') removed.

Given the output `"a---c---s"`, which is 9 characters long, the following is deduced:
- The output corresponds to one group of three characters joined by '---' (e.g., `"a---c---s"` from group `['a','c','s']`).
- The group is taken from the reversed string `ls` starting at index `i = len(ls)-3`, so the group is `ls[len(ls)-3 : len(ls)]` (the last three characters of `ls`).
- For the group to be `['a','c','s']`, the last three characters of `ls` must be `'a'`, `'c'`, `'s'`.
- Since `ls` is the reverse of `text`, the first three characters of `text` must be the reverse of `['a','c','s']`, i.e., `'s'`, `'c'`, `'a'` (forming `"sca"`).
- The loop runs only if `len(ls)-3 > 0` (i.e., `len(text) > 3`). Additionally, to avoid a second group (which would alter the output), the next index `i-3` must be ≤ 0, so `len(text)` must be ≤ 6.
- Thus, `text` must start with `"sca"` and have a length of 4, 5, or 6. The minimal valid input is `"scax"` (length 4).

Verification with `text = "scax"`:
- `ls = "scax"[::-1] = "xacs"`.
- `len(ls) = 4`, so the loop starts at `i = 4-3 = 1`.
- Slice `ls[1:4] = "acs"`, joined as `"a---c---s"` and appended with '---' → `"a---c---s---"`.
- Return `text2[:-3] = "a---c---s"`, matching the output.

Thus, the input `text` is `"scax"`.
