[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer `n`, initializes `i=1` and `j=n*n`, then enters a loop that prints `i` and `j` while incrementing `i` and decrementing `j` until `i < j` is no longer true. The output consists of 50 lines where:
- The first number in each line increases from 1 to 50
- The second number decreases from 100 to 51

This indicates:
1. The first printed line is `1 100`, so `j` starts at 100. Since `j = n*n`, we have `n*n = 100`.
2. The last printed line is `50 51`, meaning after 50 iterations:
   - `i` becomes 51 (1 + 50)
   - `j` becomes 51 (100 - 49, since j decreases by 1 per iteration for 49 iterations before the last print)
3. Solving `n*n = 100` gives `n = 10` (since `n` is positive).

Verification with `n=10`:
- `i` starts at 1, `j` at 100
- Loop runs 50 times: prints pairs (1,100) to (50,51)
- After 50 iterations, `i=51`, `j=50` â†’ loop stops since `51 < 50` is false
- Output matches exactly 50 lines as given.

Thus, the input is `10`.
