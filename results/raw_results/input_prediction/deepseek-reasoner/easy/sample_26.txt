[THOUGHT]
The function returns "error" when it encounters a token in `items.split()` that is not in `target` and has a dot ('.') at the beginning (index 0) or end (index = len(token)-1) of the token. This must occur before any token is found in `target` or before the loop completes without meeting the conditions. 

To avoid a `ValueError` from `i.index('.')`, the token must contain at least one dot. The first token must trigger the error condition to prevent processing subsequent tokens, as:
- If the first token is in `target`, the function returns its index + 1.
- If the first token is not in `target` and lacks a dot, `i.index('.')` raises an unhandled exception.

Thus, the first token must:
1. Not be in `target`.
2. Contain a dot where the first occurrence is at position 0 or len(token)-1.

A minimal valid input uses:
- `items = "."`: Splits to `['.']`, where the token has a dot at index 0 (and also at len-1, since len=1).
- `target = []`: Ensures `"." not in target` is `True`.

This triggers:
1. `"." in []` → `False`.
2. `".".index('.')` returns `0`, and `0 == len(".")-1` (which is `0`) → `True`, so return `"error"`.
