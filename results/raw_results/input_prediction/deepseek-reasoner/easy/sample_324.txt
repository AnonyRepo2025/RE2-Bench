The function `f` processes the input list `nums` as follows:
1. Creates a copy `asc` of `nums` and initializes `desc` as an empty list.
2. Reverses `asc` in place.
3. Sets `desc` to the first half of `asc` (using floor division for the midpoint).
4. Returns the concatenation `desc + asc + desc`.

Given the output is an empty list `[]`, we need to find `nums` such that this concatenation results in `[]`. 

Analyzing the steps:
- The concatenation `desc + asc + desc` can only be empty if all three parts (`desc`, `asc`, and `desc` again) are empty.
- `asc` is a reversed copy of `nums`, so for `asc` to be empty, `nums` must be empty.
- If `nums` is empty:
  - `asc = []` after copying and reversing.
  - `desc = asc[:len(asc)//2] = []` (since slicing an empty list gives an empty list).
  - The result is `[] + [] + [] = []`, matching the output.

Testing non-empty cases (e.g., `nums = [1]`, `nums = [1,2]`) produces non-empty outputs, confirming that only an empty `nums` yields `[]`.

Thus, the input `nums` must be an empty list.
