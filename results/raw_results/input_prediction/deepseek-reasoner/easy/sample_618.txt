The function is defined as:
  def f(match, fill, n):
      return fill[:n] + match

Given the output is "89", we need to find values for `match`, `fill`, and `n` such that `fill[:n] + match = "89"`.

Breaking down the output:
- The result consists of two characters: '8' and '9'.
- This can be achieved by having `fill[:n]` produce the first character '8' and `match` produce the second character '9'.
- To get `fill[:n] = "8"`, we set `n = 1` and `fill = "8"` (since `fill[:1]` takes the first character of "8", which is "8").
- Then `match` must be "9" to complete the output: "8" + "9" = "89".

Thus, the input values are:
  match = "9"
  fill = "8"
  n = 1

Verification:
  fill[:n] = "8"[:1] = "8"
  "8" + "9" = "89" (matches the given output)

This solution uses minimal string lengths and a positive integer for `n`, making it straightforward.
