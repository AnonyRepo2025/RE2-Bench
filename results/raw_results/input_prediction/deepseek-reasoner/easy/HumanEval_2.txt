[THOUGHT]
The function `truncate_number` returns the fractional part of a floating-point number using `number % 1.0`. Given the output is `0.5`, this means the input number must have a fractional part of exactly `0.5`. The modulus operation `% 1.0` isolates the fractional component, so any number of the form `integer + 0.5` would produce this result (e.g., `0.5`, `1.5`, `-0.5`). The simplest input that satisfies this condition is `0.5`, as it directly yields `0.5` when processed by the function without requiring additional integer components. Thus, the input value for `number` is `0.5`.
