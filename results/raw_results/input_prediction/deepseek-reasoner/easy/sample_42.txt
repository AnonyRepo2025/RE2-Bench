[THOUGHT]
The function `f` starts by calling `nums.clear()`, which removes all elements from the list `nums`, making it empty. The subsequent loop `for num in nums:` iterates over the now-empty list, so the loop body `nums.append(num * 2)` is never executed. The function then returns `nums`, which is an empty list `[]`. 

Given that `nums.clear()` empties the list immediately, the output will always be `[]` regardless of the initial content of `nums`. Therefore, any list input will produce this output. However, the simplest input that matches the output structure is an empty list `[]`, as it requires no additional elements and directly aligns with the observed behavior.
