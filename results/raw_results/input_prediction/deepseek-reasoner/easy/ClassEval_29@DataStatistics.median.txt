[THOUGHT]
The `median` method in the `DataStatistics` class calculates the median of a list of numbers. The output is 5, which can occur in two scenarios:
1. **Odd-length list**: The middle element after sorting is 5. For example: `[5]` → sorted is `[5]` → middle element is 5.
2. **Even-length list**: The average of the two middle numbers is 5.0, which rounds to 5.0 (represented as 5 in JSON). For example: `[3, 7]` → sorted is `[3, 7]` → average of 3 and 7 is 5.0 → rounds to 5.0.

The simplest valid input is an odd-length list with a single element `[5]`, as it directly produces the output 5. The function processes it as:
- `sorted_data = sorted([5])` → `[5]`
- `n = 1` (odd) → returns `sorted_data[0]` = 5.

Thus, the input `data` is `[5]`.
