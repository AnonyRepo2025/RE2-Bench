[THOUGHT]
The `mean` method computes the average of the input list `data` and rounds it to 2 decimal places. The output is 4.17, meaning the computed mean must round to this value. 

To achieve this, consider the rounding behavior: values from 4.165 to just below 4.175 round to 4.17. One simple integer list that satisfies this is `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]`:
- Sum = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 25
- Length = 6
- Mean = 25 / 6 â‰ˆ 4.16666...
- Rounded to 2 decimal places: 4.17 (since the third decimal is 6, which rounds up)

Thus, the input list `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]` produces the output 4.17.
