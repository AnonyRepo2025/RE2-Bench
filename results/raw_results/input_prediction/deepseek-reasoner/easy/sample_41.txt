The function `f` processes the input array and values through the following steps:
1. Reverse the input array.
2. For each value in the values list, insert it at the middle position (index = len(array) // 2) of the current array.
3. Reverse the array again.
4. Return the resulting array.

Given the output is [58, 92, 21], reversing it gives the state before the final reverse: [21, 92, 58]. This is the array after all insertions.

To find the initial array and values, consider the possible lengths:
- Let `n` be the length of the initial array and `k` be the number of values inserted. Then `n + k = 3` (the output length).
- Possible cases: `(n, k) = (0,3)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,1)`, or `(3,0)`.

Working backwards from [21, 92, 58]:
- **Case (2,1)**: 
  - Remove the last insertion (k=1). The array before insertion had length 2. The insertion index was 2//2 = 1. Remove the element at index 1 (92), leaving [21, 58]. 
  - This is the array after the first reverse (B0). The initial array must be the reverse of B0: [58, 21]. 
  - The inserted value is 92, so values = [92].
  - Verification: 
    - Start: array = [58, 21], values = [92]
    - Step 1: reverse array → [21, 58]
    - Step 2: insert 92 at index (2//2)=1 → [21, 92, 58]
    - Step 3: reverse → [58, 92, 21] → matches output.

This case is chosen as it involves a single insertion (minimal non-trivial values) and naturally places the inserted value in the middle of the output. Other cases are valid but less straightforward.
