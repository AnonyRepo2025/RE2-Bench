[THOUGHT]
The function `f` processes the input text by splitting it into words and then replacing occurrences of `-word` and `word-` with a space for each word. Finally, it strips hyphens from the start and end of the resulting string.

Given the output: `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."`

- The output contains hyphens in the middle (e.g., between "corn", "and", "beans", "in") and a hyphen before the period at the end ("soup-."). 
- The function's `strip('-')` only removes hyphens from the very beginning or end, so the hyphen in "soup-." remains because it's not at the very end (the period is).
- To produce this output, the input must result in no changes during the word-based replacement loop, except possibly having hyphens stripped from the ends.
- If the input is the same as the output, the function returns it unchanged since no `-word` or `word-` patterns match the split words (`['stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.']`).
- However, the input could also have extra hyphens at the very beginning or end that get stripped. For example:
  - Input `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"` would have the final hyphen stripped, yielding the output.
  - Input `"-stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."` would have the initial hyphen stripped, yielding the output.
- Choosing `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"` as the input:
  - Split words: `['stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'soup-.-']`
  - No `-word` or `word-` patterns match these words in the text.
  - `strip('-')` removes the final hyphen, resulting in the output.

Thus, the input text is `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.-"`.
