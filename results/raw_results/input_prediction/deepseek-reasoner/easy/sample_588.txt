The function `f` returns the index of `target` in `items` if present, otherwise -1. The output is 3, meaning:
1. `target` must be in `items`
2. The first occurrence of `target` must be at index 3
3. `items` must have at least 4 elements (indices 0-3)
4. `target` must not appear in the first 3 indices (0, 1, 2) to ensure the first occurrence is at index 3

A valid input is `items = [0, 1, 2, 3]` and `target = 3`:
- `items[3] = 3` matches `target`
- `target` 3 is not in `[0, 1, 2]` (first 3 elements)
- `items.index(3)` returns 3, matching the output
