[THOUGHT]
The `add_employee` method returns `False` when the provided `employee_id` already exists in the system. The output is `false`, indicating the employee ID was a duplicate. The input structure requires:
1. `self.employees` must contain at least one employee with ID "1" (as per the structure template).
2. The method call's `employee_id` argument must be "1" to trigger the duplicate case.
3. Other fields (name, position, department, salary) can be arbitrary since they don't affect the duplicate check, but must match the expected data types.

I'll use:
- Existing employee (ID "1"): Name="John Doe", Position="Manager", Department="Sales", Salary=50000
- Method arguments: employee_id="1", Name="Jane Smith", Position="Developer", Department="IT", Salary=60000

This satisfies:
- `self.employees` has ID "1" → duplicate exists
- Method called with `employee_id="1"` → returns `False`
