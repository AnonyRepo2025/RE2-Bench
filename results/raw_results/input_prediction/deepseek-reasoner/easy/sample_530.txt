The function returns "ff" as output. This means:
1. The branch `if ch in s` was taken (otherwise it would return 'no').
2. After stripping leading characters in `ch` from `s`, the result is "ff".
3. The stripped result "ff" is non-empty, so the branch adding '!?' was not taken.

To achieve "ff" as the stripped result:
- `s` must start with one or more characters from `ch`.
- The stripping must stop at "ff", meaning the first character of "ff" ('f') must not be in `ch` (otherwise it would be stripped too).
- The condition `ch in s` must be true (i.e., `ch` must appear as a contiguous substring in `s`).

A simple valid input is:
- `s = "aff"`: Starts with 'a' (which is in `ch`), followed by "ff".
- `ch = "a"`: 
  - `"a" in "aff"` is True (satisfies the condition).
  - `"aff".lstrip("a")` removes the leading 'a', resulting in "ff".
  - "ff" is non-empty, so it is returned.

Thus, the input `s="aff"` and `ch="a"` produces the output "ff".
