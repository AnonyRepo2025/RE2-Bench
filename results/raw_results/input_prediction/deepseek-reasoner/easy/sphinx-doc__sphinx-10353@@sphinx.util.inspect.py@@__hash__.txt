The output is the result of calling `__hash__` on a `TypeAliasForwardRef` instance, which is defined as `hash(self.name)`. The output value is -8736153336041072635. 

Since the hash of an integer in Python is the integer itself (except for -1, which is special-cased), setting `self.name` to the integer -8736153336041072635 will satisfy:
```python
hash(-8736153336041072635) == -8736153336041072635  # True for integers in Python
```

The structure requires `name` to be set, and there are no type constraints in the structure or class definition preventing `name` from being an integer. This approach directly produces the required output when `__hash__` is called.
