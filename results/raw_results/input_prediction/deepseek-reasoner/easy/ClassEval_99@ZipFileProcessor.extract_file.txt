[THOUGHT]
The output is `true`, indicating the `extract_file` method successfully extracted the specified file from the zip archive. For this to happen:
1. `self.file_name` must be a valid path to an existing zip file (e.g., "archive.zip").
2. `args.file_name` must be the name of a file that actually exists within the zip archive (e.g., "file.txt").
3. `args.output_path` must be a valid directory path where the file can be written (e.g., "extracted").
Since the output confirms success, these inputs must be valid and accessible. I'll use generic placeholder values that satisfy these conditions.
