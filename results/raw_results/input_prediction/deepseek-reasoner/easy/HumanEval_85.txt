[THOUGHT]
The function `add` processes a list `lst` by:
1. Iterating over indices starting from 1 (second element) with a step of 2 (i.e., indices 1, 3, 5, ...)
2. For each index, checking if the element is even
3. Summing all qualifying even elements

Given the output is 12, the sum of even elements at these indices must be 12. 

To achieve this with minimal elements:
- Use a list with two elements: 
  - Index 0 (first element) can be any integer (e.g., 0) as it's ignored
  - Index 1 (second element) must be 12 (even, and included in the sum)
- Thus, `lst = [0, 12]` satisfies:
  - `range(1, len(lst), 2)` → indices: [1]
  - `lst[1] = 12` (even) → sum = 12

Other solutions exist (e.g., `[1, 4, 2, 8]`), but `[0, 12]` is the simplest.
