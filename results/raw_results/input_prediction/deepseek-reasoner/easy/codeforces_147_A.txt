[THOUGHT]
The code processes the input string in three main steps:
1. It adds a space after each punctuation mark in `t` (',.?!').
2. It normalizes whitespace by stripping leading/trailing spaces and collapsing consecutive spaces into single spaces.
3. It removes any space that appears immediately before a punctuation mark.

Given the output "physicist? mathematician. astronomer", we can deduce the input by reversing these steps. The output has no space before punctuation, so step 3 did nothing. The normalized string after step 2 is the same as the output. Step 1 added a space after each punctuation mark. Therefore, the input must have been a string that, after adding spaces after punctuation and normalizing whitespace, results in the output.

Testing with the output string as input:
- Step 1: Add space after punctuation → "physicist?  mathematician.  astronomer" (extra spaces added).
- Step 2: Normalize whitespace → "physicist? mathematician. astronomer" (collapses extra spaces).
- Step 3: Remove space before punctuation (none present) → output matches.

Thus, the input can be the same as the output, as it satisfies all transformations.
