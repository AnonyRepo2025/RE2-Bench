[THOUGHT]
The `get_variance` method computes the population variance (since `np.var` uses `ddof=0` by default) of the `data` array and rounds it to 2 decimal places. The output is 1.25, meaning the variance must be exactly 1.25 (since rounding 1.25 to two decimals remains 1.25). 

To achieve a variance of 1.25:
- For an array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
  - Mean = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5
  - Variance = [(1-2.5)² + (2-2.5)² + (3-2.5)² + (4-2.5)²] / 4 = [2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25] / 4 = 5/4 = 1.25

This array produces the exact output when processed by `get_variance`. Thus, the input `data` for the class instance should be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
