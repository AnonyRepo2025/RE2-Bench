[THOUGHT]
The `list_employees` method iterates over `self.employees` (a dictionary) and constructs a new dictionary where each key is the employee ID from `self.employees`, and the value is a dictionary containing:
- An 'employee_ID' field set to the employee ID (the key from `self.employees`)
- All key-value pairs from the employee's info dictionary in `self.employees`

Given the output:
```
{
    "1": {
        "employee_ID": 1,
        "name": "John",
        "position": "Manager",
        "department": "Sales",
        "salary": 100000
    }
}
```
This means:
- The top-level key "1" corresponds to the employee ID in `self.employees`.
- The inner dictionary includes 'employee_ID' (which matches the top-level key, but as an integer in the output) and additional fields: name, position, department, salary.

However, note that the method sets `employee_details['employee_ID'] = employee_id` directly from the key in `self.employees`. The output shows 'employee_ID' as an integer (1), but the top-level key is a string ("1"). This suggests that in the actual Python object, the key in `self.employees` is the integer 1, and the JSON representation converts it to a string for the top-level key while keeping the inner 'employee_ID' value as an integer.

But the input structure requires the key to be specified as a string ("1"). To resolve this:
1. The employee info in `self.employees` for key "1" must contain the fields: name, position, department, salary.
2. The values for these fields are taken directly from the output's inner dictionary (ignoring 'employee_ID', as it is added by the method).

Thus, for the employee with key "1" in `self.employees`:
- "name" is "John"
- "position" is "Manager"
- "department" is "Sales"
- "salary" is 100000

The output's 'employee_ID' field (integer 1) is derived from the key in `self.employees`, but since the structure specifies a string key ("1"), we use that. The type discrepancy in 'employee_ID' (string in input vs. integer in output) may arise from JSON representation but does not affect the input values we need to provide.
