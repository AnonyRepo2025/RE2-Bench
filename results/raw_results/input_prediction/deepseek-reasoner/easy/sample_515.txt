[THOUGHT]
The function `f` performs three operations on the input array:
1. Creates a copy of the input array.
2. Reverses the copied array in-place.
3. Replaces each element in the reversed array with its double.

Given the output `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`, we can reverse-engineer the input:
- The output is the result of doubling each element after reversal.
- Therefore, before doubling, the reversed array was `[10/2, 8/2, 6/2, 4/2, 2/2] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- Since this is the reversed version of the original array, the original array must be the reverse of `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Verification:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Copy: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- After reversal: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
- After doubling: `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]` (matches output).

Thus, the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
