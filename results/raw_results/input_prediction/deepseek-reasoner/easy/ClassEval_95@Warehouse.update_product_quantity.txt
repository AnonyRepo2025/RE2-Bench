[THOUGHT]
The `update_product_quantity` method updates the quantity of a product if the `product_id` exists in the inventory. The output is `null` because the method doesn't return anything. For the update to occur, `product_id` must match an existing key in `self.inventory`. The structure specifies that `self.inventory` contains a product with ID "1". Therefore, `product_id` must be "1" to trigger the update. The initial quantity and name for product "1" can be arbitrary since they don't affect the output (which is always `null`). Similarly, the `quantity` argument can be any integer. I'll choose simple values: name as "Product 1", initial quantity as 100, and update quantity as 5.
