The output is 0.0, meaning the Euclidean distance between the hour and minute hands is zero. This occurs when the hands are at the same position, requiring:
1. The angles θ_h and θ_m must be equal modulo 2π (so the directions are identical).
2. The lengths a and b must be equal (so the positions coincide).

The angle formulas are:
- θ_h = 2.5π - 2π × ((h + m/60) / 12)
- θ_m = 2.5π - 2π × (m/60)

Setting θ_h ≡ θ_m (mod 2π):
- 2.5π - 2π × ((h + m/60)/12) = 2.5π - 2π × (m/60) + 2πk (k integer)
- Simplifies to: h = (11/60)m - 12k

Given integer h and m (with 0 ≤ m ≤ 59), the only valid solution is m = 0 and k = 0, yielding h = 0. Additionally, a must equal b for the positions to match. Choosing a = b = 1 (smallest positive integers) satisfies the conditions. Verification:
- At h = 0, m = 0: θ_h = θ_m = 2.5π (≡ π/2 mod 2π)
- Positions: (x_h, y_h) = (0, 1), (x_m, y_m) = (0, 1)
- Distance = √((0-0)² + (1-1)²) = 0.0

Thus, the input string is "1 1 0 0".
