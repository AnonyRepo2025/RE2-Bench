[THOUGHT]
The function `f(a, b)` merges two dictionaries `a` and `b` using `{**a, **b}`, where values from `b` override conflicting keys in `a`. The output is `{"w": 3, "wi": 10}`. 

Given the input structure:
- `a` must have keys `"w"` and `"wi"`
- `b` must have key `"w"`

From the output:
- `"wi": 10` must come from `a` since `b` doesn't have this key, so `a["wi"] = 10`.
- `"w": 3` comes from `b` because `b` overrides `a`'s value for key `"w"`, so `b["w"] = 3`.
- `a["w"]` is overridden and not visible in the output, so it can be any value. We use `0` as a placeholder.

Thus:
- `a = {"w": 0, "wi": 10}`
- `b = {"w": 3}`
