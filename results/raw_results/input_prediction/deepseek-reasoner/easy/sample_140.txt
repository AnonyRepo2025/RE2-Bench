[THOUGHT]
The function `f(st)` returns "Hey" if there exists an 'h' at or after the last occurrence of 'i' in the lowercase version of `st`. Otherwise, it returns "Hi". Given the output "Hey", the input string must:
1. Contain at least one 'i' (since `rindex('i')` would raise a `ValueError` otherwise).
2. Have at least one 'h' occurring at or after the last 'i' in the lowercase string.

For example, in the string "ih":
- Lowercase: "ih"
- Last 'i' at index 0
- Search for 'h' starting from index 0: found at index 1
- Condition: 1 >= 0 → True → returns "Hey"

Thus, "ih" is a valid input that produces the output "Hey". Other strings like "iH", "abcidefgh", or "i h" would also work, but "ih" is the simplest case.
