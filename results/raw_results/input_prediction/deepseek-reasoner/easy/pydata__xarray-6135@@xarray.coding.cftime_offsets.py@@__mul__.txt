[THOUGHT]
The output is "NotImplemented", which occurs when the `__mul__` method encounters a float for `other`. The method returns `NotImplemented` specifically when `isinstance(other, float)` is True. The value of `self.n` doesn't affect this branch since the condition only depends on the type of `other`. Therefore:
1. `other` must be a float (e.g., 1.0)
2. `self.n` can be any integer (e.g., 1) as its value isn't used in this path
