The function `f(text, froms)` performs two operations:
1. `text.lstrip(froms)`: Removes leading characters present in `froms`.
2. `text.rstrip(froms)`: Removes trailing characters present in `froms`.

Given the output is `"1co"`, we need inputs `text` and `froms` such that after both stripping operations, the result is `"1co"`. 

- The output `"1co"` must be preserved in the middle of the input `text`, with possible leading/trailing characters that are in `froms` and get stripped.
- For `"1co"` to remain after stripping:
  - The first character '1' must not be in `froms` (otherwise, it would be stripped if leading).
  - The last character 'o' must not be in `froms` (otherwise, it would be stripped if trailing).
- We can choose `froms = "xy"` (which excludes '1', 'c', 'o') and `text = "x1coy"`:
  - Leading 'x' (in `froms`) is stripped: `"x1coy"` → `"1coy"`.
  - Trailing 'y' (in `froms`) is stripped: `"1coy"` → `"1co"`.
This satisfies the output.

Thus, the input is `text = "x1coy"` and `froms = "xy"`.
