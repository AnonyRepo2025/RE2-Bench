[THOUGHT]
The function `f` iterates backward through the list `nums` from the second-last element to the first. For each element at index `i`, if the element is even, it removes that element from the list. The output is `[5, 3, 3, 7]`, which contains only odd numbers. 

To achieve this output:
1. The input must include the odd numbers `5`, `3`, `3`, and `7` in the same order, as removals preserve the order of remaining elements.
2. The last element must be odd (here, `7`), because the function does not check the last element (iteration starts at `len(nums)-2`), so any even last element would remain in the output.
3. Even numbers can appear in positions that are checked (i.e., not the last position) and will be removed. For example, inserting an even number like `2` at index 1 (between `5` and `3`) will be removed during backward iteration.

Simulating with input `[5, 2, 3, 3, 7]`:
- Initial list: `[5, 2, 3, 3, 7]` (length=5).
- Iterate from index 3 (second-last) down to 0:
  - Index 3: element `3` (odd) → no removal.
  - Index 2: element `3` (odd) → no removal.
  - Index 1: element `2` (even) → remove. List becomes `[5, 3, 3, 7]`.
  - Index 0: element `5` (odd) → no removal.
- Return `[5, 3, 3, 7]`, matching the output.

This input works and includes an even number to demonstrate removal, similar to the non-minimal example in the provided template.
