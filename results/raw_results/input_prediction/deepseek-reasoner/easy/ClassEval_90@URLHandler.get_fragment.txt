[THOUGHT]
The `get_fragment` method extracts the part of a URL after the first '#' character (the fragment). Given the output "aaa", the input URL must contain "#aaa" such that:
1. The '#' is present (otherwise it returns None)
2. The fragment starts immediately after '#' and is exactly "aaa"
3. There must be no characters after "aaa" in the fragment (since the method returns everything after '#' until end of string)

The simplest URL satisfying this is "#aaa" where:
- `url.find('#')` returns index 0
- `url[0 + 1:]` returns "aaa"

Alternative URLs like "https://example.com#aaa" would also work, but "#aaa" is the minimal valid input.
