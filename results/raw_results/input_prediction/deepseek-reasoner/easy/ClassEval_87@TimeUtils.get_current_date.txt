[THOUGHT]
The `get_current_date` method returns a string formatted as '%Y-%m-%d' from the `self.datetime` attribute. The output is "2025-08-25", which corresponds to August 25, 2025. 

The `self.datetime` attribute is expected to be a `datetime.datetime` object. Since the input must be provided in JSON format, which doesn't support Python objects directly, the date is represented as a string in ISO 8601 format ("YYYY-MM-DD"). This string can be parsed to create the equivalent `datetime` object (e.g., using `datetime.fromisoformat`), ensuring that when `strftime('%Y-%m-%d')` is called, it returns "2025-08-25". 

The time part is omitted because the output only depends on the date, and the time is irrelevant here. Thus, the input for `self.datetime` is the string "2025-08-25".
