[THOUGHT]
The code reads an integer input `N`. If `N` is even, it prints `0.5`. If `N` is odd, it prints `(N + 1) / (N * 2)`. The given output is `0.5`, which occurs when `N` is even. Therefore, `N` must be an even integer. Any even integer (e.g., 2, 4, -2) would produce this output. For simplicity, I'll choose the smallest positive even integer, `2`. The input should be provided as a string since `input()` reads a string, so the JSON input value is `"2"`.
