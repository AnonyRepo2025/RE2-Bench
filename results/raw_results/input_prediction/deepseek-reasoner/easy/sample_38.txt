[THOUGHT]
The function `f(string)` performs two operations:
1. `string.title()`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word and converts the rest to lowercase. Words are defined as contiguous sequences of alphabetic characters, with non-alphanumeric characters (like hyphens) acting as word separators.
2. `.replace(' ', '')`: Removes all spaces.

Given the output `"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"`, we can reverse-engineer the input:
- The output contains hyphens, so they must exist in the input.
- `"ErrBzz"` indicates two words ("Err" and "Bzz") were concatenated, meaning the input had a space between them.
- `"1Oe"` comes from a word like `"1oe"` (title casing capitalizes the first alphabetic character after the digit).
- `"Bzz"` and `"Bmm"` come from lowercase words like `"bzz"` and `"bmm"`.

The input structure must include:
- `"1oe-"` for the first segment (digit preserved, `oe` in lowercase).
- `"err "` (with a space) for the second segment.
- `"bzz-"` for the third segment.
- `"bmm"` for the last segment.

Thus, the input string is `"1oe-err bzz-bmm"`. Verification:
1. `"1oe-err bzz-bmm".title()` → `"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm"` (spaces and hyphens preserved, words title-cased).
2. `.replace(' ', '')` → `"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"` (matches output).
