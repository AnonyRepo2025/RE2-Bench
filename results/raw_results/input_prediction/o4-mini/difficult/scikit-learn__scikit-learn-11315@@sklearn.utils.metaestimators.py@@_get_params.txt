[THOUGHT]
1. `_get_params` first calls `super(...).get_params(deep=True)`, which will return a dict containing:
   - All init parameters of `self` (`transformers`, `remainder`, `n_jobs`, `transformer_weights`), and
   - For any of those whose value has a `get_params` method (here only `remainder`), it will add keys of the form `remainder__<param>` with their values.
2. The observed output includes:
   - `"n_jobs": 1`
   - `"transformer_weights": null`
   - `"transformers": null`  (so `self.transformers` must have been `null`)
   - The `remainder__*` keys (`copy`, `with_mean`, `with_std`) and also a `"remainder"` entry which is the object itself serialized as its own parameter dict.
3. Then, because `deep=True`, `_get_params` does:
     estimators = getattr(self, attr)
     out.update(estimators)
   and for each `(name, estimator)` in `estimators`, it sets `out[name] = estimator` (and would recurse if the estimator had its own `get_params`, but here the estimator is the string `"passthrough"`).
4. The only extra key in the output beyond the base params + `remainder__*` keys is `"trans1": "passthrough"`.  This must come from `estimators = [("trans1", "passthrough")]`.  Therefore:
   - `attr` must be `"transformers"`,
   - `self.transformers` must be `[("trans1", "passthrough")]`.
5. The call must have been `_get_params("transformers", deep=True)`.

Putting this together, the reconstructed input is:
