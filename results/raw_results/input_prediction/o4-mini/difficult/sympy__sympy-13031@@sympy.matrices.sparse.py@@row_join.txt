[THOUGHT]
We want the result of row_join to be a 2×1 sparse matrix with entries 1 and 2 at (0,0) and (1,0).  
The code path used is the “not isinstance(B, SparseMatrix)” branch, which reads from B._mat as a flat list of length rows×cols.  
row_join does:
- A.cols must be 0 so that final cols = B.cols = 1.
- A.rows must equal B.rows = 2.
- B._mat must be [1, 2] so that v = 1 at k=0 → A._smat[(0,0)] = 1, and v = 2 at k=1 → A._smat[(1,0)] = 2.
Therefore:
self.rows = 2, self.cols = 0, self._smat = {}  
other.rows = 2, other.cols = 1, other._mat = [1, 2]  
kwargs is empty.
