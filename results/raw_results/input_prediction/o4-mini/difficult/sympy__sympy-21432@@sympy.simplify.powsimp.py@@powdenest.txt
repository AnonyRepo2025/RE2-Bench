[THOUGHT]
1. The observed output is the string "_x", which matches how SymPy prints a Symbol with name "_x".
2. In the default (force=False, polar=False) branch, the code does:
     new = powsimp(sympify(eq))
     return new.xreplace(...)
   Since there are no Pow or exp instances, xreplace does nothing, so powdenest(eq) just returns sympify(eq).
3. To get Symbol('_x'), we can pass eq as the string "_x", so sympify("_x") â†’ Symbol('_x') which prints as "_x".
4. Therefore, we set eq = "_x", and leave force and polar at their defaults (both False).
