[THOUGHT]
1. The output lists all of the `self` attributes after calling `fit`. None of those attributes appear to have been changed inside `_BaseVoting.fit` (in particular `estimators`, `voting`, `weights`, `n_jobs`, `flatten_transform` remain as they were), so the input `self` must have had the exact same values.
2. We see that after fitting, both `le_.classes_` and `classes_` are `"[0 1 2]"`, which implies that the label encoder was fit on `y = [0, 1, 2]`.  
3. The `fit` method was called without an explicit `sample_weight`, so `sample_weight` was `None`.  
4. `X` can be any array with three samples; the simplest choice is a 3Ã—1 array such as `[[0], [1], [2]]`.  

Thus the placeholders fill in directly from the output for `self`, and we infer `X`, `y`, and `sample_weight` as above.
