[THOUGHT]
We know from the output shapes that
- code has shape (10, 5), so X must have 10 samples and we passed n_components=5.
- dictionary has shape (5, 8), so X must have 8 features.
- Because the returned tuple has 4 entries (code, dictionary, errors, n_iter), the call must have been made with return_n_iter=True.
- All other parameters were left at their defaults: tol=1e-08, max_iter=100, method='lars', method_max_iter=1000, n_jobs=None, code_init=None, dict_init=None, verbose=False, random_state=None, positive_dict=False, positive_code=False.
- α must have been supplied; the usual choice in examples is α=1.0.

We do not know the exact numeric contents of X (the 10×8 data matrix that produced these code and dictionary matrices), but we know it must be a real‐valued array of shape (10, 8).  

Filling in all of the placeholders, the call must have looked like this:
[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "X": [[… a 10×8 real‐valued array …]],
        "n_components": 5,
        "alpha": 1.0
    },
    "kwargs": {
        "tol": 1e-08,
        "max_iter": 100,

    }
