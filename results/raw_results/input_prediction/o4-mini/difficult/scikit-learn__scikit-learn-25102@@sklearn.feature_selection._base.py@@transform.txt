[THOUGHT]
1. The `transform` method for a sparse input simply returns `X[:, mask]`. The output sparse matrix has the same data, indices, and indptr as the input if the mask is all `True`.
2. The output has shape [2, 5], `data` length 9, `indices` length 9, and `indptr` length 3, exactly matching a 2×5 CSR matrix with all features selected.
3. Therefore, the input `X` must be the same CSR matrix:
   - shape = [2, 5]
   - maxprint = 50
   - data = "[ 2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18]"
   - indices = "[1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4]"
   - indptr = "[0 4 9]"
4. The selector’s `get_support()` must have returned an all-True mask of length 5, so `n_features_in_` = 5.
5. The `step` object itself is not further inspected during `transform`, so we can represent it as an empty dict.

Thus, the filled-in input is:
