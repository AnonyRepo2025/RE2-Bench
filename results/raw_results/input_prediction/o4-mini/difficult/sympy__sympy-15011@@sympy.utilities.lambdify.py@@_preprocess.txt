[THOUGHT]
The JSON `"output": [null, "x**2"]` corresponds to the Python return value `(argstrs, expr)` where `argstrs` was `None` and `expr` was the string `"x**2"`.  In the call `_preprocess(self, args, expr)`, that means:

- the `expr` argument must have been `"x**2"`,
- the `args` argument must have been `None` (so that `argstrs` came back as `None`),
- and nothing in the call or in `self` forced any dummy‐variable substitutions, so `self._dummify` was `False`.

Filling these into the given structure (and leaving `_exprrepr` and `_argrepr` as empty mappings, since they aren’t involved in this particular call) gives:
