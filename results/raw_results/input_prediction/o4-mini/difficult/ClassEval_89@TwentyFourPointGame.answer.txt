[THOUGHT]
We need `answer` to return False. One straightforward way:
- Set `self.nums` to [1,2,3,4].
- Choose an `expression` that uses each of these digits exactly once but does *not* evaluate to 24, for example `"1+2+3+4"` which is 10.
  
Step-by-step:
1. `expression != 'pass'`, so skip the first branch.
2. We collect digits in `"1+2+3+4"`, getting statistic = {'1':1, '2':1, '3':1, '4':1}. All these are in `self.nums`.
3. We iterate through `self.nums` [1,2,3,4], decrementing each count in `nums_used`, ending with all zeros.
4. Since all counts are zero, we call `evaluate_expression("1+2+3+4")`, which returns False because 10 != 24.
5. Thus `answer` returns False as desired.
