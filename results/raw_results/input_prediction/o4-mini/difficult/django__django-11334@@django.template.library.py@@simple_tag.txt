[THOUGHT]
The output is an empty JSON, so no information was conveyed about any of the parameters. We must therefore assume that `simple_tag` was invoked with all of its default arguments.

- `self` is a fresh Library instance, so `self.filters = {}` and `self.tags = {}`.
- The only positional parameter in our structure is `func`, which by default is `None` (represented as `null` in JSON).
- The other parameters `takes_context` and `name` also default to `None`, but since they arenâ€™t required in the structure, we leave `kwargs` empty.

Thus the input must be the defaults: `func = null`, and no keyword args.
