[THOUGHT]
We need exactly one substring whose value is ≡0 mod 2019. The code counts:
- each suffix `s[i:]` with mod 0 once,
- plus one count for every pair of equal nonzero mods (which we must avoid).

The simplest way is to have exactly one suffix mod 0 and no duplicate mods at all. If we choose s = "0", then:
- len(s)=1
- Only suffix is "0" → value 0 → mod 2019 = 0
- mods0toi = [0]
- Counter is {0:1}, so ans = 1 (for c==0) + 0 = 1
No other substrings exist, so output is exactly 1.
