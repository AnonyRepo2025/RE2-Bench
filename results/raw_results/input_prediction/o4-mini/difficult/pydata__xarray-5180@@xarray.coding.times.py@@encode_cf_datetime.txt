[THOUGHT]
We need encode_cf_datetime to return  
  num = 10  
  units = "days since 2000-01-01"  
  calendar = "gregorian"  

Since the returned units and calendar exactly match the inputs, the easiest way is to pass them explicitly (so we skip the infer/cleanup branches except `_cleanup_netcdf_time_units` which will leave them unchanged).  

Under the hood, with  
  units="days since 2000-01-01"  
  calendar="gregorian"  
the code will parse out  
  delta = "days", ref_date = "2000-01-01"  

and then compute  
  time_deltas = dates - ref_date  
  num = time_deltas // 1 day  

To get num = 10, we need one date exactly 10 days after 2000-01-01, i.e. 2000-01-11. The function expects a NumPy array of dtype datetime64[ns], so we will pass  
  dates = np.array(["2000-01-11T00:00:00"], dtype="datetime64[ns]")  

Putting it all together:
