[THOUGHT]
The program reads a single integer x and factors it into primes with their exponents.
For each prime factor with exponent num:
 - If num == 1, it adds j = 1 to ans.
 - Otherwise, it finds the largest j such that 1 + 2 + ... + j ≤ num, adding that j to ans.
We need the total ans to come out to 2.

Case 1: A single prime with exponent num giving j = 2.
  - For num = 3: 1 + 2 = 3 ⇒ j = 2 ⇒ ans = 2.
  - For num = 4 or 5, similarly j = 2.
  Example: x = 8 (2³) ⇒ ans = 2.

Case 2: Two distinct primes each with exponent 1.
  - Each contributes j = 1 ⇒ total ans = 1 + 1 = 2.
  Example: x = 6 (2¹·3¹) ⇒ ans = 2.

The simplest positive integer to produce ans = 2 is x = 6.
