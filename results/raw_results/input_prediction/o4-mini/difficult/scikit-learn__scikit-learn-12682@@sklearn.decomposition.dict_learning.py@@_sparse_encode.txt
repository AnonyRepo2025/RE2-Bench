[THOUGHT]
We see the output is a 3×8 array with only two non-zero entries:
 - output[0,2] = 0.08546831  
 - output[2,7] = 0.79366708  

The function supports a simple “threshold” algorithm where
  new_code = (sign(cov) * max(|cov|–regularization,0)).T  
If we set regularization=0, then new_code = cov.T. We can therefore supply cov directly as the transpose of the desired output; the function will just transpose cov back to the output.

We need X and dictionary only to satisfy the shape check dictionary.shape[1] == X.shape[1], but their contents are unused in the “threshold” branch. We can pick a single feature (n_features=1) so that X is 3×1, dictionary is 8×1.

Thus:

X = [[0],[0],[0]]  
dictionary = [[0],[0],[0],[0],[0],[0],[0],[0]]  
gram = null  (unused)  
cov = output.T, i.e. an 8×3 array where row2 = [0.08546831, 0, 0], row7 = [0, 0, 0.79366708], others zero.  
algorithm = "threshold", regularization = 0, and all other kwargs at their defaults.
