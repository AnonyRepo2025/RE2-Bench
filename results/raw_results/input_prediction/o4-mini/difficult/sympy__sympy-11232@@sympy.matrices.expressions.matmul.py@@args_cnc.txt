[THOUGHT]
The method `args_cnc` was called with no additional arguments, directly on a `MatMul` instance (`self`) that has no scalar or matrix factors. Hence
1. `self` is simply an “empty” `MatMul` (no args).
2. There are no positional (`args`) or keyword (`kwargs`) parameters.

That matches the reported output of `[null, null]` for the two returned components. Since the structure had no `XXX` placeholders, the input is exactly the empty/default structure.
