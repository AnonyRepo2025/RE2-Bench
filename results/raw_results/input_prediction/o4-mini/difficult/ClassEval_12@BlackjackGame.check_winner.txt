[THOUGHT]
To get "Player wins", we can pick a simple case where both hands are under 21 and the player's total is higher than the dealer's.  
For example:
- player_hand = ["10H"] → value = 10  
- dealer_hand = ["9C"] → value = 9  
Since 10 > 9, the final else branch (`return 'Player wins'`) is taken.  
The deck is not used in `check_winner`, so we can set it to an empty list.  
We mirror these hands both in `self` and in the `args`, and leave `kwargs` empty.
