[THOUGHT]
1. The output is `["1", null]`.  In our JSON encoding, the first element `"1"` corresponds to the string form of `coeff = S.One`, and the second `null` corresponds to an empty list of factors (`[]`) being rendered as `null`.  
2. Inside `_symbolic_factor_list`, when you pass in a purely numeric expression like `1`, the code
   - Initializes `coeff = S.One`, `factors = []`.
   - Processes `expr = 1` via `Mul.make_args`, sees it is a Number, multiplies it into `coeff`, and never adds anything to `factors`.
   - Since there are no non-numeric factors and whether `method` is `'sqf'` or not, an empty factors list remains.
3. Therefore the simplest input is `expr = 1`, an empty `opt = {}`, and any `method` (it won’t change the empty‐factor result).  
4. We choose `method = "foo"` (a placeholder string not equal to `"sqf"`), yielding the desired output.
