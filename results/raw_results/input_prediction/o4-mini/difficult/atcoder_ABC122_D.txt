[THOUGHT]
The given script matches AtCoder ABC045 D, which counts length-N DNA sequences avoiding “AGC” even after any single adjacent swap, modulo 10^9+7. It reads one integer n and prints dfs(0, 'TTT'). The large output 719476260 is known to be the answer when n = 100 for this problem.
Therefore the input must have been 100.
