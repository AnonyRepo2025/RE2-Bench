[THOUGHT]
We need `__add__` to produce a Media object `combined` whose `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` both end up empty (printed here as `null`).  Looking at the code:

1. `combined = Media()` initially makes
   ```
   combined._css_lists = [{}]
   combined._js_lists  = [[]]
   ```
2. Immediately then
   ```
   combined._css_lists = self._css_lists[:] 
   combined._js_lists  = self._js_lists[:]
   ```
3. Finally it loops over `other._css_lists` and `other._js_lists` and appends any truthy, non-duplicate entries.

To end up with empty lists in `combined`, we must have:
- `self._css_lists` and `self._js_lists` both empty, so slicing them gives `[]`.
- `other._css_lists` and `other._js_lists` both empty so no items are appended.

Hence the inputs are all four lists empty.  No keyword args are used.
