[THOUGHT]
The output shows that after calling fit, the estimator’s attributes are
epsilon=1.35, max_iter=100, alpha=0.0001, warm_start=False, fit_intercept=True, tol=1e-05,
and also n_iter_, scale_, intercept_, coef_, outliers_ have been set by the fit call.

The signature of fit is fit(self, X, y, sample_weight=None). In the output no sample_weight was mentioned, so the call must have used the default sample_weight=None.

Before calling fit, self only had the hyperparameters set by __init__; none of the fitted attributes (n_iter_, scale_, etc.) existed. We fill those with null to indicate “not yet set.”

Thus the input to fit must have been:
– self.epsilon=1.35
– self.max_iter=100
– self.alpha=0.0001
– self.warm_start=False
– self.fit_intercept=True
– self.tol=1e-05
– X and y: some numeric arrays (shape must be (50,20) and (50,) since coef_ has length 20 and outliers_ length 50), but their exact contents aren’t recoverable from the output.
– sample_weight: None

We therefore fill in the structure accordingly, using null for attributes not yet set and for sample_weight, and indicate X and y as generic array placeholders.
