[THOUGHT]
To get a contravariant order of 2, we need an expression whose order sums to 2. 
- A single BaseVectorField has order 1.
- A TensorProduct of two BaseVectorField instances has order 1+1=2.
No other branch in the code can produce 2 without error. 
Thus the simplest input is 
    expr = TensorProduct(v1, v2)
where v1 and v2 are BaseVectorField instances. There are no kwargs or self‚Äêstate needed.
