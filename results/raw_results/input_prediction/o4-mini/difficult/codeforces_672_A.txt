[THOUGHT]
The code builds a list `li` by concatenating the digits of all integers from 1 through 370:
- For 1–9, it appends the number itself (one digit each).
- For 10–99, it splits into two digits and appends both.
- For 100–370, it splits into three digits and appends all three.
After the loop, it pops the last two digits (those would be the '0' and '7' from "370"), leaving a total of 1000 digits.

It then reads an integer `n` and prints `li[n-1]`, the nth digit in this sequence.

We want the printed output to be `7`. The very first occurrence of `7` in the digit sequence "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 ..." is at position 7 (since `li[0]=1`, `li[1]=2`, ..., `li[6]=7`). Therefore, supplying `n = 7` will cause `print(li[6])` to output `7`.
