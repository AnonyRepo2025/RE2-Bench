[THOUGHT]
We need a call `self.distance(p)` that returns `sqrt(17)/2`. The code computes

    sqrt(sum((a - b)**2 for a, b in zip(self.args, p_args)))

so the squared distance must be

    (sqrt(17)/2)**2  = 17/4

We can choose a simple 2-D example with `self` at the origin `(0,0)` and `p` at coordinates whose squared differences sum to 17/4. For instance:

    Δx = 1/2  →  (1/2)**2 = 1/4
    Δy = 2    →  2**2     = 4 = 16/4

1/4 + 16/4 = 17/4, so

    distance = sqrt(17/4) = sqrt(17)/2

Since the code treats any non-Point iterable as coordinates, we can pass `p` as a list `[0.5, 2]`. The `self` point is assumed to be `(0,0)` (not shown in the structure). Thus:

p = [0.5, 2]
