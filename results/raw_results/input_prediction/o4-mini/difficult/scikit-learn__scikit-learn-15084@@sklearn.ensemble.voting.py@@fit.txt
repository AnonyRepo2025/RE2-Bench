[THOUGHT]
The output shows that after calling fit, the estimator’s attributes are all still null (None in Python) except for named_estimators_ which is an empty dict. That means we must have started with self.estimators = None, self.weights = None, self.n_jobs = None, and sample_weight left at its default of None. The values of X and y do not affect these printed attributes in this trivial case, so we can supply any valid sparse‐like structure for X and a matching y. A minimal choice is a small “sparse” with two entries and a two‐element y.  
Thus:
- self.estimators → null  
- self.weights → null  
- self.n_jobs → null  
- X → a 2×2 sparse‐style object:  
    • _shape: [2, 2]  
    • maxprint: 10 (arbitrary)  
    • indices: [0, 1]  
    • indptr: [0, 2]  
    • data: [1.0, 2.0]  
- y → [0, 1]  
- sample_weight → null  
- kwargs → {}  
This reproduces the shown output.
