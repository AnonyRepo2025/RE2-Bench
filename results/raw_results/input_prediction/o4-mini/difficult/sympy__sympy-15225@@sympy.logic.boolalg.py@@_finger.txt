Fingerprint vector v for a single symbol x is built as follows:
- v[0]: count of top‐level symbol occurrences → we need 0
- v[1]: count of top‐level Not(x) occurrences → we need 0
- v[2]: count of symbol occurrences inside a non‐Not composite → we need 1
- v[3]: count of Not(x) occurrences inside a composite → we need 1
- v[4]: complexity sum for those inner occurrences; for a composite a with 2 args, one of which is a Not, we get o = len(a.args) + number_of_Not_args = 2 + 1 = 3, and this o is added once (for the one inner symbol) → we need 3

A single composite node a with .args = [ x , Not(x) ] does exactly that:
  - it is neither a Symbol nor a Not itself → enters the composite (else) branch
  - len(a.args) = 2, one of them is Not → o = 3
  - for ai = x: ai.is_Symbol → v[2] += 1, v[4] += 3
  - for ai = Not(x): ai.is_Not → v[3] += 1

Thus setting eq._argset = [ a ] where a.args = [ x, Not(x) ] produces the fingerprint (0,0,1,1,3) mapping to [x]. In JSON we only need to describe enough of the structure so that the code’s attribute checks succeed (is_Symbol / is_Not / args).
