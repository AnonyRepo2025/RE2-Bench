The report shows three classes: blue, green, red, with supports 24, 31, 20 (total 75).  
For blue:
 precision = 0.83 ≈ 19/23 → TP_blue=19, FP_blue=4  
 recall = 0.79 = 19/24 → FN_blue=5  
For green:
 precision = 0.33 = 3/9 → TP_green=3, FP_green=6  
 recall = 0.10 ≈ 3/31 → FN_green=28  
For red:
 precision = 0.42 ≈ 18/43 → TP_red=18, FP_red=25  
 recall = 0.90 = 18/20 → FN_red=2  

Check accuracy = (19+3+18)/75 = 40/75 ≈ 0.53 – matches.  
We can assign misclassifications to fill confusion:
 blue→green=4, blue→red=1 (sum FN_blue=5)  
 green→blue=4, green→red=24 (sum FN_green=28)  
 red→green=2, red→blue=0       (sum FN_red=2)  

Construct y_true and y_pred of length 75 in blocks:
 - First 24 true blues: 19 "blue", 4 "green", 1 "red"
 - Next 31 true greens: 4 "blue", 3 "green", 24 "red"
 - Last 20 true reds: 0 "blue", 2 "green", 18 "red"
