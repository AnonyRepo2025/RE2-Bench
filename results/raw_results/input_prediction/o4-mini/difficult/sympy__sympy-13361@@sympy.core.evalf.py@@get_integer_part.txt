[THOUGHT]
We need `get_integer_part(expr, no, options, return_ints)` to return `[0, 0]`. That happens only when `return_ints=True`, since then the function returns `(int(...), int(...))` as a list in JSON.

To get both integer parts zero, the simplest choice is `expr = 0`. For any `no` (Â±1) the real part of zero is 0, imaginary part is treated as zero as well. We can pick `no = 1`. `options` can be empty.

Thus:
- expr = 0
- no = 1
- options = {}
- return_ints = true
