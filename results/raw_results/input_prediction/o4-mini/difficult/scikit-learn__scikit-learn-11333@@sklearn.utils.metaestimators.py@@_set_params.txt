1. The output dict corresponds exactly to the instance attributes after calling `_set_params`.  
   - transformers: null  
   - remainder: "drop"  
   - n_jobs: 2  
   - transformer_weights: null  

2. Inspecting `_BaseComposition._set_params(self, attr, **params)`:
   - If `attr` (a key) is in `params`, it replaces `self.attr`. Otherwise it leaves `self.attr` unchanged.
   - It then extracts any sub-estimators named in `params` (not relevant here since `transformers` is None and no `__` keys).
   - Finally it calls `super().set_params(**params)`, which sets any remaining top-level parameters (`remainder`, `n_jobs`, `transformer_weights`, etc.) on `self`.

3. Since `transformers` remains `null` in the output, we must NOT have passed `transformers` in `params`.  Instead, it was already `None` on `self` before the call.

4. The only attribute that changed is `n_jobs`, from whatever it was (presumably `None`) to `2`, so the only key in `kwargs` must have been `n_jobs: 2`.

5. `remainder` and `transformer_weights` stay at their existing values (`"drop"` and `null`), so they were not passed in `params` either.

6. The positional argument `attr` must be the name of the attribute holding the list of transformers, i.e. `"transformers"`.

7. Therefore, the call was `_set_params("transformers", n_jobs=2)`, on an instance whose initial state was:
   - transformers = null  
   - remainder = "drop"  
   - n_jobs = null  
   - transformer_weights = null
