From the fitted attributes we can see:

- All of the constructor‐arguments on `self` remain at their defaults.
- `X_offset_` is the column‐wise mean of `X`, roughly [0.5726, 0.4564, 0.5398, 0.4416, 0.5043].
- `intercept_` ≃ 0.9931 and the estimated coefficients are ≃ [1.00, –0.005, 1.02, –1.00, 0.0008].  Putting that together,
  y_offset = intercept + X_offset⋅coef ≃ 0.9931 + (0.5726 –0.0022 +0.5491 –0.4415 +0.0004) ≃ 1.6728,
  so y must have been generated as
    y = 1 + X[:,0] + X[:,2] – X[:,3]
  (exactly) on data X whose columns were Uniform(0,1) draws with those means.
- The simplest reconstruction is to assume, e.g., 100 samples:

    rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
    X = rng.rand(100,5)
    y = 1 + X[:,0] + X[:,2] - X[:,3]

With that `fit(X,y)` would produce exactly those offsets, intercept and very small noise in the coefficient estimates (Bayesian shrinkage).  All other parameters are defaults.

So the input to `fit` was:

self: BayesianRidge(n_iter=300, tol=1e-3, alpha_1=1e-6, alpha_2=1e-6, lambda_1=1e-6, lambda_2=1e-6,
                    alpha_init=None, lambda_init=None, compute_score=False,
                    fit_intercept=True, normalize=False, copy_X=True, verbose=False)

args:
    X = array of shape (100,5) drawn from Uniform[0,1]
    y = 1 + X[:,0] + X[:,2] - X[:,3]

No kwargs.
