[THOUGHT]
1. The `fit` method was called with `n_components=None`, `whiten=False`, `copy=True`, and a user‐supplied `batch_size` so that `batch_size_` ends up as 38.  Since `batch_size_ = self.batch_size` when `batch_size` is not `None`, we infer `batch_size = 38`.
2. The final `n_samples_seen_` is 100, so the input array `X` must have had 100 rows.
3. The `components_` matrix is 3×3, so `X` must have had 3 features (shape=(100, 3)).
4. We cannot uniquely reconstruct all 300 values of `X` from the PCA outputs alone, but we know its shape and that it was accepted by `check_array` as a dense float array.
5. Therefore, the input JSON fills in the four estimator parameters and indicates that `X` was a 100×3 numeric array.
