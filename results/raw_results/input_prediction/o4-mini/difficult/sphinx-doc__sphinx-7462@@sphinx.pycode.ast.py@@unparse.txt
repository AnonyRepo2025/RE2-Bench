[THOUGHT]
To produce the string "[1, 2, 3]", `unparse` must have been called on an AST List node whose `.elts` are three number‚Äêliteral nodes whose values are 1, 2, and 3.  

In the `unparse` code, the List case does:
  return '[' + ', '.join(unparse(e) for e in node.elts) + ']'
and each numeric element is handled by the Constant (or Num) case, returning `repr(node.value)`, i.e. "1", "2", "3".  

When you parse the literal "[1, 2, 3]" at the top of a module, the list node will have:
- lineno = 1, col_offset = 0
- end_lineno = 1, end_col_offset = 9  (there are 9 characters in "[1, 2, 3]")
- ctx is unused for lists, so we can leave it as an empty dict in this representation.

Thus the call was effectively:
unparse(List(elts=[Constant(value=1), Constant(value=2), Constant(value=3)], 
             ctx=Load(), lineno=1, col_offset=0, end_lineno=1, end_col_offset=9))

Filling those values into the given JSON structure yields:
