[THOUGHT]
1. The output ticks are exactly [1.e-01, 1.e+00, 1.e+01, 1.e+02, 1.e+03, 1.e+04], i.e. pure decades from 10⁻¹ to 10⁴.  
2. To get purely b**decades with no intermediate subs, `have_subs` must be False. In the code that requires `_subs` to be a sequence of length 1 containing 1.0 (so that `subs = [1.0]` and `have_subs` → False).  
3. The base `b` must be 10.0 so that decades correspond to powers of 10.  
4. The automatic tick count logic (`numticks == 'auto'`) and no axis means `numticks` resolves to 9, giving stride=1.  
5. vmin and vmax must be exactly 0.1 and 10000.0 so that after generating decades from -2..5 and filtering with `raise_if_exceeds`, only 10⁻¹..10⁴ remain.  
6. `numdecs` is not used in this method; we can set it to null.
