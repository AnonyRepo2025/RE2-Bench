[THOUGHT]
We need to find what argument `other` was passed to `__eq__` to get `True`. The last `__eq__` shown is for `Integer`:

```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, integer_types):
        return self.p == other
    elif isinstance(other, Integer):
        return self.p == other.p
    return Rational.__eq__(self, other)
```

Since the result is `True`, one possibility is that `other` was a plain Python int equal to the internal `.p` of the SymPy `Integer`. A common test is comparing `Integer(1)` to `1`, which returns `True`. We only need to supply the `other` argument; `self` is omitted in this structure. Thus:

other = 1
