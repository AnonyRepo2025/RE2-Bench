We need to produce a SparseMatrix A with _smat = {(0,0): 1, (1,0): 2}, rows = 2, cols = 1 as the result of col_join(self, other).

col_join does:
1. If self.rows == 0 and self.cols != other.cols, it recurses—but here final cols=1, so we’ll match cols and skip that.
2. Checks A.cols == B.cols: so self.cols and other.cols must both be 1.
3. Does A = self.copy(): starting with an empty _smat and rows = self.rows.
4. Since other is not a SparseMatrix, it uses the “dense” branch:
   b = other._mat (a flat sequence of length rows*cols)
   iterates k over range(rows*cols), mapping each v to A._smat[i + A.rows, j].

To get two entries in A._smat at (0,0)=1 and (1,0)=2:
- Let self.rows = 0, self.cols = 1, self._smat = {}.
- Let other.rows = 2, other.cols = 1.
- Let other._mat = [1, 2].

Then:
- A starts empty with rows=0.
- Iteration i=0,j=0,k=0 → v=1 → A._smat[(0,0)] = 1
- i=1,j=0,k=1 → v=2 → A._smat[(1,0)] = 2
- Finally A.rows = 0 + 2 = 2, A.cols = 1.

Thus the input is:
self: { _smat: {}, rows: 0, cols: 1 }
other: { rows: 2, cols: 1, _mat: [1,2] }
No kwargs.
