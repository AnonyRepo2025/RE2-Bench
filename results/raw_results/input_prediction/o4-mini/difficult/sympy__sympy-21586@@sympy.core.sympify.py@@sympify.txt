[THOUGHT]
We see the output was  
```
{ "_args_set": "{'2.00000000000000', '3'}" }
```  
This strongly suggests that `sympify(a)` returned an Add‚Äêexpression whose `.args` are the two numbers 2.00000000000000 (a Sympy Float) and 3 (a Sympy Integer).  The test harness evidently did something like:
```
expr = sympify(a)
print({"_args_set": str(set(map(str, expr.args)))})
```
and got the set of stringified arguments `{'2.00000000000000', '3'}`.

To get an Add with exactly those two literals, the simplest input is the string `"2.00000000000000 + 3"`.  Passing that to `sympify` causes it to parse the float literal `2.00000000000000` and the integer `3` and build the sum.  

Therefore, the input field `a` must be the string `"2.00000000000000 + 3"`.
