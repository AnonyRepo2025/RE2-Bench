[THOUGHT]
1. The output of `factor_terms` is the string representation of the simplified expression: “R3 + R4 + 4050”.
2. `factor_terms` begins by calling `sympify(expr)`. If `expr` is already that sum (e.g. the string `"R3 + R4 + 4050"`), then `sympify` will produce the Sympy expression R3+R4+4050, and `do(...)` sees an Add whose content‐primitive is itself, so no further change is made.
3. Therefore the simplest input that yields exactly that output is to pass `"R3 + R4 + 4050"` as the `expr` argument, with no other kwargs or internal state needed.
