[THOUGHT]
The only branch that returns a `Pow` is the `elif term.is_Pow` case. It returns

    term.base ** summation(term.exp, (k, a, n))

and the output shown is

    2**Sum(2*f(k), (k, 1, n)).

Hence:
- `term.base` must be `2` (so base = 2).
- `summation(term.exp, (k,1,n))` must yield `Sum(2*f(k),(k,1,n))`, so `term.exp` must be `2*f(k)`.
- The limits tuple is `(k, 1, n)` exactly as printed.
No other arguments or kwargs are involved.

Therefore the call was

    _eval_product(self, 2**(2*f(k)), (k, 1, n))

and in JSON form we can represent the Sympy objects by their string forms.
