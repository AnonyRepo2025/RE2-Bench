[THOUGHT]
The debug output tells us that `repl` was invoked with exactly two positional arguments (nargs = {2}) and no keyword arguments. The inner function `repl` has no `self` (itâ€™s just a closure) and we have no other data to fill in. There are no XXX placeholders to replace, so we simply emit the empty structure as given.
