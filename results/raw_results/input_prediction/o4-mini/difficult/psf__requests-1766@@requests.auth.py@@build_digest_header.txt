[THOUGHT]
We see the output header:

Digest username="user", realm="me@kennethreitz.com", nonce="b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4", uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", response="a15a1e022b6edf3943bcf7e43ca0ad07", opaque="21d73260ff0b61c1f304ee40444f24bf", algorithm="MD5", qop="auth", nc=00000002, cnonce="f06a18e88940ac77"

From this we infer:

- username = "user"
- password = "pass"  (the URI ends .../user/pass)
- chal dict must have been set by parsing WWW-Authenticate:
    realm="me@kennethreitz.com"
    nonce="b65c75a3f423e5780128d1a798ec40b4"
    qop="auth"
    opaque="21d73260ff0b61c1f304ee40444f24bf"
    algorithm="MD5"
    stale is not included in the header, so stale=None
- before this build call, last_nonce already equals the nonce (so we are on a second build call) and nonce_count was 1, so on this call nonce_count increments to 2 and yields nc=00000002.  We must therefore have had last_nonce identical and nonce_count=1 on entry.
- num_401_calls was bumped to 2 during the single retry in handle_401 and then not reset, so num_401_calls=2.
- pos was never set from a real body.tell(), so remains None.
- method must have been "GET" (the default for a simple digest-auth fetch) and url parse yields path "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", so we can set url to "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass".
