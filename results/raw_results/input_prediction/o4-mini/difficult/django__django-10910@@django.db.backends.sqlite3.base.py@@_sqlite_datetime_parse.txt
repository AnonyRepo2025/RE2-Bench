We need `_sqlite_datetime_parse` to return a timezone‚Äêaware datetime that when printed yields the string  
  "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00".

1. The first step is `typecast_timestamp(dt)`. If `dt` is something like `"2016-06-13 00:00:00"`, `typecast_timestamp` will parse it into  
   `datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 13, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)`  
   (because in Django with `USE_TZ=True`, the timestamp parser attaches `utc`).

2. Next, since we want no further adjustments, we set both `conn_tzname` and `tzname` to `None`.  
   - The `if conn_tzname:` block is skipped.  
   - The `if tzname is not None and tzname != conn_tzname:` block is also skipped.

3. The function returns the datetime with `tzinfo=UTC`. When printed (via `str(dt)`), this yields  
   `"2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00"`.

Thus the simplest input is  
  dt = "2016-06-13 00:00:00"  
  tzname = None  
  conn_tzname = None
