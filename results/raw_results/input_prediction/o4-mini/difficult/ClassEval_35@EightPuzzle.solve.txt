[THOUGHT]
The `solve` method initializes `open_list` with `(initial_state, [])`, then immediately pops it and checks if `current_state == goal_state`. If so, it returns `path`, which is `[]`. Since the output is `[]`, `initial_state` must already equal `goal_state`. The hard-coded `goal_state` is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]`, so `initial_state` must be the same.
