[THOUGHT]
The method `process_csv_data(N, save_file_name)` returns the value of `write_csv`, which is 1 on success. Since the output is 1, we know the CSV was successfully written, so there was no exception. Any valid integer `N` and a string ending in `.csv` would work, provided the file exists and has at least `N+1` columns. We just need to pick a plausible example. Here I choose to read from `"data.csv"` and extract column index `0`. This will lead to a successful write and return 1.
