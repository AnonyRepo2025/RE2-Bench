1. The output is a NumPy array of five UTC timestamps:
   ['1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000',
    '1681-05-27T13:00:00.500000000',
    '1681-05-27T14:00:00.500000000',
    '1681-05-27T15:00:00.500000000',
    '1681-05-27T16:00:00.500000000']
2. In the pandas decoding path, we parse “<delta_units> since <ref_date>”, convert each entry in `num_dates` to a timedelta of `<delta_units>`, and add it to `ref_date`.
3. To get a .5‐second fraction on each timestamp, `<delta_units>` must be "seconds", and `ref_date` must be exactly "1681-05-27T12:00:00". Then:
   - num_dates[0] × 1 s = 0.5 s → 12:00:00 + 0.5 s = 12:00:00.500
   - num_dates[1] × 1 s = 3600.5 s → +1 h + 0.5 s = 13:00:00.500
   - and so on for 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, i.e. 7200.5, 10800.5, 14400.5 seconds.
4. Thus the simplest matching input is:
   num_dates = [0.5, 3600.5, 7200.5, 10800.5, 14400.5]
   units = "seconds since 1681-05-27T12:00:00"
   calendar = None (so it defaults to "standard")
