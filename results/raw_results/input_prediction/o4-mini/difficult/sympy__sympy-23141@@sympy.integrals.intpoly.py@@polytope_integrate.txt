[THOUGHT]
The only placeholder in the provided structure is `expr`. In order for `polytope_integrate` to return exactly the rational  
  
  1633405224899363/24000000000000  
  
with no further processing (i.e. bypassing any non‐trivial integration logic), the simplest possibility is that the integrand `expr` is simply that constant rational. In that case, for a unit‐volume polytope the integral of a constant is the constant itself, matching the output exactly. There are no other placeholders to fill, so we set

    expr = 1633405224899363/24000000000000

and leave `poly` as given (`{}`).
