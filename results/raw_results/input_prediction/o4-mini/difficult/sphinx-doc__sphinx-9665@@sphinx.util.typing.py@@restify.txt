[THOUGHT]
1. The output `":py:obj:`None`"` is produced by the first branch of `restify`, which is:
   `if cls is None or cls is NoneType: return ':py:obj:`None`'`.
2. Supplying `cls = None` will trigger that branch.
3. No other branches or exceptions are needed.
Therefore, the input `cls` should be `null` in JSON (Python `None`).
