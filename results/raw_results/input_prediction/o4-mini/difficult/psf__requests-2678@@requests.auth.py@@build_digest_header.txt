[THOUGHT]
We need to find the call to build_digest_header that yields exactly:

Digest username="user", realm="me@kennethreitz.com", nonce="54c8df80c7443b10ad9890ddfce551f9", uri="/digest-auth/auth/user/pass", response="2a3292bcb01e5d08c466eacc7609d2b6", opaque="cbe3b2ba4f82f0040cf76baec4025b43", algorithm="MD5", qop="auth", nc=00000001, cnonce="e2f9f401162cf240"

From the code:

- username must be "user"
- password must be "pass" (matches URI and response calculation)
- chal must contain exactly the realm, nonce, qop, opaque, algorithm seen in the header
- algorithm in chal must be "MD5" so that the code includes the algorithm clause
- qop="auth" so that the qop/nc/cnonce clause is added
- last_nonce must be different from the current nonce to force nonce_count to be set to 1 (so nc=00000001)
- method must be "GET" to compute HA2 correctly for the given response
- url must parse to path "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass" (no query)

The other thread‐local fields (init, pos, num_401_calls) aren’t used in build_digest_header, so we can give them benign values.

Thus the input structure is:
