[THOUGHT]
1. The function scans the input `pattern` for substrings matching the named‚Äêgroup syntax `(?P<name>...)`.  
2. If none are found, `named_group_indices` is empty, so the loops do nothing and the original `pattern` is returned unchanged.  
3. The observed output is `"admin/password_change/done/"`, which therefore must equal the input `pattern`.  
4. `self` has no attributes used by this function, and there are no keyword arguments.
