[THOUGHT]
We want nsimplify(expr, constants) to return the SymPy expression GoldenRatio/2.  By default nsimplify only turns floats into rational combinations of the given constants.  To get GoldenRatio/2 we must:

1. Pass in a numeric approximation of GoldenRatio/2, e.g. 0.809016994374947.
2. Supply GoldenRatio in the `constants` list so that PSLQ can detect the ratio to that symbol.

Thus the call must be

    nsimplify(0.809016994374947, [GoldenRatio])

which indeed yields GoldenRatio/2.
