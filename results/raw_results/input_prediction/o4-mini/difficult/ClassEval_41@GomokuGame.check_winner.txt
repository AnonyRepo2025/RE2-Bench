[THOUGHT]
The goal is to produce check_winner output "O". check_winner scans each cell; when it finds a non-space, it checks four directions for exactly five in a row of the same symbol. The simplest board is size 5 with the first row entirely "O", so at (0,0) direction (0,1) finds 5 O's. It returns board[0][0] which is "O". current_player can be "O" to reflect the last move. All other cells are spaces. No X sequence exists, so the first winning line is the O's on row 0.
