[THOUGHT]
1. The reported output is the string `1/(y*\"tanh(1)\")`, which in normal SymPy notation is `1/(y*tanh(1))`.
2. Note that coth(1) = 1/tanh(1), so the expression `coth(1)/y` is algebraically equal to `1/(y*tanh(1))`.
3. The `exptrigsimp` routine will rewrite `coth(1)` into `1/tanh(1)`, producing exactly `1/(y*tanh(1))`.
4. Therefore the simplest input to get that result is the SymPy expression `coth(1)/y`.
