[THOUGHT]
We see the function returned a two‐element “output” array where the second element is null (JSON), i.e. Python None.  In `_construct_simple`, the only way to return None is via the early `else: return None` inside the loop, which happens as soon as a coefficient is not recognized as Rational, Float, a “pure complex,” or an algebraic number (when `opt.extension` is False).

– `opt` is given as `{}`, so `opt.extension` is False and `is_algebraic` always returns False.

– To hit the `else: return None` on the very first coefficient, we need a coefficient that is not a Rational, not a Float, not a pure complex.  A plain SymPy `Symbol` (e.g. `x`) will do exactly that:
    * `coeff.is_Rational` → False  
    * `coeff.is_Float` → False  
    * `pure_complex(coeff)` → False  
    * `is_algebraic(coeff)` → False  
    → falls to `else: return None`

Thus a minimal call is `_construct_simple([x], opt)` with `opt = {}`.  We don’t need any special `self`, so we leave `"self": {}`.  We represent the unknown Symbol object with `{}` in the JSON (as in the example for unknown objects).
