[THOUGHT]
1. The final output is the string "50", so `simplify(expr)` must have returned a Sympy object whose string representation is "50"â€”most likely `Integer(50)`.
2. The simplest way to get `Integer(50)` out of `simplify` is to pass in an expression that multiplies to 50, for example `5*10`.
3. When `simplify("5*10")` is called:
   - `sympify("5*10")` parses it into `Mul(Integer(5), Integer(10))`.
   - The simplify logic multiplies these to give `Integer(50)`.
4. Thus, with `expr` set to the string `"5*10"` and no kwargs, the output would be `"50"`, matching the given result.
