[THOUGHT]
1. The output has no migration header (no “# Generated by Django…”), so `include_header` must be False.
2. Only one import appears: `from django.db import migrations`, which Django adds when there are no models imports. So no operations or dependencies produce additional imports.
3. `migration.operations` must be an empty list for “operations = [\n    ]”.
4. `migration.dependencies` must be empty so “dependencies = [\n    ]”.
5. `needs_manual_porting` stays False since no manual imports are added.
6. `migration.__module__` and `migration.__doc__` are not used in rendering; we can supply placeholder values.

Thus the input fields are:
- self.migration.operations = []
- self.migration.__module__ = any string
- self.migration.__doc__ = null
- self.include_header = false
- self.needs_manual_porting = false
- args and kwargs both empty.
