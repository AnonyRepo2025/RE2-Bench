[THOUGHT]
1. The output shows that after calling fit:
   - self.regressor_ is a LinearRegression fitted model with 10 coefficients, so the input X must have had 10 features.
   - self._training_dim is 1, so the input y was a 1‐dimensional array.
2. The top‐level “regressor” in the output matches the initial self.regressor parameters, not the fitted regressor_. Since self.regressor is not None, the user must have passed in a LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True, normalize=False, copy_X=True, n_jobs=None) at construction.
3. transformer is null, func is the sqrt function, inverse_func is the log function, and check_inverse is True—these were the constructor arguments.
4. We cannot recover the exact numerical values of X and y just from the fitted coefficients and residuals (there are infinitely many (X,y) pairs that lead to the same solution). Therefore we represent them as array placeholders indicating their required shapes.
5. The kwargs dict is empty.
