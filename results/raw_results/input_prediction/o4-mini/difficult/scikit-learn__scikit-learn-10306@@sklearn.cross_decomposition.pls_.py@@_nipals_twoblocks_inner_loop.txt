[THOUGHT]
We know the function returned a tuple (x_weights, y_weights, ite) = (array shape (3,1), array shape (2,1), 4). The third element, ite=4, is the number of inner‐loop iterations performed before breaking. Since `max_iter` defaults to 500 and the loop typically converges in far fewer than 500 steps, the fact that ite=4 suggests that either:

- they let it converge naturally (default `max_iter=500`), hitting the tolerance condition at iteration 4, or  
- they explicitly set `max_iter=4` to force an early stop on the 4th iteration.

In scikit‐learn’s own tests for the NIPALS inner loop they often explicitly set `max_iter` small to test the warning/stop behavior. Here there is no warning printed, but even if there were, it doesn’t prevent the return of ite=4. The other keyword defaults are:
- mode = 'A'
- tol = 1e-06
- norm_y_weights = False

No positional `args` are used – everything is passed via `kwargs`. We don’t know the exact numerical contents of X and Y (they must be NumPy arrays of shape (n_samples, 3) and (n_samples, 2) respectively) but for the structure we only need to fill in the objects that were passed. Thus the call was:

_nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop(X=…, Y=…, mode='A', max_iter=4, tol=1e-06, norm_y_weights=False)

… returning ite=4.
