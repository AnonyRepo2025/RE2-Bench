[THOUGHT]
We see the result 2.2204460492503136e-16 is exactly machine epsilon for float64. That arises when you compute −log(1−eps) ≈ eps. The average log‐loss is eps, meaning each sample incurred a loss of ≈eps.

The code path that yields this is:
- Provide a 2‐class problem (so no “only one label” error).
- Give perfect one‐hot predictions [[1,0],[0,1]] for true labels [0,1].
- eps='auto' → eps = np.finfo(y_pred.dtype).eps ≈ 2.22e‐16.
- Clipping turns 1→1−eps, 0→eps.
- For each sample the loss = −log(1−eps) ≈ eps.
- Mean of two identical eps values = eps.

Thus a minimal input is:
y_true = [0,1]
y_pred = [[1.0,0.0],[0.0,1.0]]
eps = 'auto'
