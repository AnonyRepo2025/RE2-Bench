[THOUGHT]
1. The output is 2*I*sin(2*_Dummy_588).  
2. The rule for sinh in `_osborne` is: sinh(a) â†’ I*sin(a*d).  
3. To get sin(2*_Dummy_588), we need a = _Dummy_588 and d = 2.  
4. The outer factor 2 comes from having 2*sinh(_Dummy_588) as the original expression.  
5. Therefore, the input `e` must be the SymPy expression 2*sinh(_Dummy_588).
