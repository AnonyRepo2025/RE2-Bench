[THOUGHT]
The `do` function is applied to a Sympy expression `expr`. It first sympifies the input and then, since the expression is a non‚Äêatomic `Basic` and is iterable, it recursively processes its arguments. In this case the output

    (-1 + sqrt(3)*I)*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)

is a `Mul` whose two arguments are

    -1 + sqrt(3)*I
    (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)

When `do` recurses into these, each subexpression is likewise a `Basic` whose `do` will return it unchanged. Since none of the recursive calls change anything, `newargs == args` and so `do(expr)` returns the original expression unchanged. Therefore the input to `do` must have been exactly that same Sympy expression. In JSON we represent it as the string

    "(-1 + sqrt(3)*I)*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)"

and no additional kwargs are used.
