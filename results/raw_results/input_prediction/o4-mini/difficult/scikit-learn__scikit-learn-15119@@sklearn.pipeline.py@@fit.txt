[THOUGHT]
The output shows exactly the three attributes of the Pipeline instance (`steps`, `memory`, `verbose`) and nothing about `X` or `y`.  In scikit-learn, `Pipeline.__init__` defaults are `memory=None` and `verbose=False`.  Here `steps` was evidently set to `None` as well.  The `fit` method signature is `fit(self, X, y=None, **fit_params)`, and since nothing is known or printed about `X` or `y`, the simplest assumption is that both were passed in as `None`.
