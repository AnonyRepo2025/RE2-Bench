[THOUGHT]
The only way `_expand_partial_derivative` ends up returning `S.Zero` (a plain SymPy integer) is when `not args[0].free_symbols` is true – i.e. the thing we’re differentiating has no free symbols (it’s a constant). In that branch the method returns immediately and never sets `_indices`, `_free`, or `_dum` on the returned object. When you then serialize those attributes you get `null` for each. Since `args` and `kwargs` are empty for this call, the input snapshot simply has those three fields as `null`.
