[THOUGHT]
The only things we can be certain of from the reported output are:

- All of the constructor‐set attributes remain at their defaults:  
  alpha=1.0, fit_intercept=True, normalize=False, copy_X=True, max_iter=None, tol=0.001, solver='auto', random_state=None.

- Since this is the state of the model *after* fit, but our “input” to fit must reflect the model *before* fit, none of coef_, n_iter_ or intercept_ existed yet. We therefore set them to null (the usual placeholder before they are created).

- There is no way to reconstruct the exact X and y that produced those numbers, nor is any information about them encoded in the output. All we can infer is that no sample_weight was passed, so sample_weight=None.

Accordingly we fill every XXX with the only values we can know.
