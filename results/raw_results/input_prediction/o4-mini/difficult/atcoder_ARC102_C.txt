[THOUGHT]
The program reads two integers K, N.
It then builds an array X of length 2*K−1 and prints each element on its own line.
Since the observed output is a single line “0”, we must have 2*K−1 = 1 ⇒ K = 1.
For K = 1, the code computes a sum S which equals 1 when N < 2, and 0 when N ≥ 2.
To match the output 0, we need N ≥ 2; the simplest choice is N = 2.
Thus the input line should be “1 2”.
