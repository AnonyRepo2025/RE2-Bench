[THOUGHT]
The sieve produces all primes ≤ n. The output list [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13] stops at 13, so n must be 13 (if n were larger, 17 would also appear). The method takes no args or kwargs. The only input field used is self.n; self.primes isn’t read by generate_primes and isn’t initialized before the call, so we can represent it as null.
