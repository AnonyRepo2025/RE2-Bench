[THOUGHT]
We know that `_eval_subs` returned the Sympy expression `2*x`.  Looking at the override in `Application._eval_subs`:

    if old.is_Function and new.is_Function and callable(old) and callable(new)
       and old == self.func and (len(self.args) in new.nargs):
        return new(*[i._subs(old, new) for i in self.args])

So:
- `self` must be an `Application`‚Äêinstance on which we are doing the substitution; the only thing that appears in the structure is its `nargs`, which we leave as `{}`.
- `old` must be a Sympy function (a `FunctionClass` instance), so that `old.is_Function` is `True`, and it equals the function being applied (`old == self.func`).
- `new` must also be a Sympy function, callable, and its `.nargs` must contain the number of arguments of `self` (here 1).
- Finally, `new(x)` must evaluate (via its `.eval`) to `2*x`.

A minimal choice is:
- `old = f = Function('f')`, an undefined Sympy function with no arity constraints (`f._nargs is None`), module `"sympy.core.function"`, and docstring `"Undefined function f"`.
- `new` could be a subclass of `Application` which accepts exactly one argument and whose `eval` returns `2*arg`.  Such a class would end up with `new.nargs = FiniteSet(1)`, so its `_elements` list is `[1]`.

Filling in the required placeholders:

- `old.__module__` = `"sympy.core.function"`
- `old.__doc__` = `"Undefined function f"`
- `old._nargs` = `null`  (i.e. Python `None`)
- `new.nargs._elements` = `[1]`

The rest of the structure remains as given.
