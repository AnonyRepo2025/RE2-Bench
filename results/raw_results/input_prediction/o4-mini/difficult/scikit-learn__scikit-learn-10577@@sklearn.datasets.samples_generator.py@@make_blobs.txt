[THOUGHT]
The output X has shape (8,2) and y has length 8 with exactly five 0’s and three 1’s. By default, if n_samples is an integer and centers is an integer, samples are evenly split among clusters; here we see a 5 + 3 split, so n_samples must have been given as the iterable [5,3]. Centers was not passed (so centers=None) and thus was drawn by the RNG as a (2,2) array. To make the result reproducible, a fixed random_state must have been provided. The user most likely passed random_state=0 (a common choice). All other parameters are left at their defaults.
