[THOUGHT]
The output shows a single field “nargs” whose `_elements` is `frozenset({2})`. In SymPy, any Bessel‐function class (e.g. `besselj`, `besseli`, `besselk`, `bessely`) has an attribute `nargs` equal to `FiniteSet(2)`, whose internal `_elements` is `frozenset({2})`. The simplest such object to pass in as `expr` is the function class `besselj` itself, since

    besselj.nargs._elements == frozenset({2})

and calling `besselsimp(besselj)` will leave it unchanged and return it, yielding exactly that serialization. No kwargs or self‐state are needed.
