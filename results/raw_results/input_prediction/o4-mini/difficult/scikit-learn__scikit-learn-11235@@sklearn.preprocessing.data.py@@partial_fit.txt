[THOUGHT]
We need to call StandardScaler.partial_fit(X) once so that after the call

  self.mean_ == array([...30 elements…]),
  self.var_ == array([...30 elements…]),
  self.n_samples_seen_ == 470,
  self.scale_ == sqrt(self.var_) with zeros fixed.

We know from the code that

– If the scaler is just constructed, it has no mean_, var_ or n_samples_seen_.
– partial_fit then sees no n_samples_seen_, does
     mean_=0.0, n_samples_seen_=0, var_=0.0
  but immediately replaces them by calling
     _incremental_mean_and_var(X, 0.0, 0.0, 0),
  so that the returned mean_, var_, n_samples_ are exactly the sample mean and (population) variance of X, and scale_ = _handle_zeros_in_scale(sqrt(var_)).

Hence the only thing we need is:

• A fresh scaler with with_mean=True, with_std=True, copy=True, and no pre‐existing mean_, var_, etc.
• An array X of shape (470,30) whose column means and variances match the given vectors.

We don’t know the individual entries of X, only that they must produce these summary statistics.  Therefore the minimal “input” is:

– self.with_mean = true
– self.with_std  = true
– self.copy      = true
– self.mean_     = null       (no prior attribute)
– self.n_samples_seen_ = null
– self.var_      = null
– self.scale_    = null
– args.X         = the 470×30 array whose per‐column mean and variance are exactly the given vectors
– kwargs = {}

We can’t literally list all 14 100 entries of X here, but we can indicate that X is exactly the data whose column‐wise statistics are as shown in the output.
