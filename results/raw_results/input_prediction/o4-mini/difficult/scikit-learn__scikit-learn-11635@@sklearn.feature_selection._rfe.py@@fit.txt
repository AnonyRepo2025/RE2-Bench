[THOUGHT]
We know from the output that after fitting:

- support_ = [False, False, False, True], so there were 4 features and only the last was selected.
- ranking_ = [4, 3, 2, 1], consistent with 4 features and the last ranked best.
- n_features_ = 1.
- grid_scores_ = [0., 0., 0., 0.], so the RFE path evaluated 4 elimination steps, all scoring zero.
- step = 1, cv = 5, scoring = None, verbose = 0, n_jobs = None, min_features_to_select = 1, and the estimator’s foo_param stayed 0.
- estimator_ ends up with coef_ = [1.], meaning that when fitting the cloned estimator on the single retained feature, it found a coefficient of 1.0.

To reproduce coef_ = [1.], a simple choice is to let X have 5 samples (so that KFold(n_splits=5) works) and 4 features, where only the last feature perfectly predicts y with slope 1. For instance:

X = [
 [0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1],
]

y = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Then transforming down to the retained feature gives a constant column of ones, and fitting yields coef_ = [1.].

All other parameters are directly as in the output or their defaults (None → null in JSON).

Thus the input to fit must be:
self.estimator.foo_param = 0
self.step = 1
self.cv = 5
self.scoring = null
self.verbose = 0
self.n_jobs = null
self.min_features_to_select = 1
args.X = the 5×4 array above
args.y = the length-5 vector of ones
kwargs = {}
