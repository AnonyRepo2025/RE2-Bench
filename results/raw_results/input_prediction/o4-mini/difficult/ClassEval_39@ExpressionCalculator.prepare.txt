[THOUGHT]
The `prepare` method does not return anything (implicitly returns `None`), so the observed output `null` simply reflects that no value is returned. To match this, the simplest possible input is an empty expression string `""`. In that case:
- The loop over `arr = list(expression)` never runs.
- `count` remains 0, so nothing is ever appended to `postfix_stack`.
- The final while-loop sees the only item in `op_stack` is the initial comma and does nothing.
Thus after calling `prepare("")`, `postfix_stack` remains empty and `operat_priority` stays its default `[0, 3, 2, 1, -1, 1, 0, 2]`.
