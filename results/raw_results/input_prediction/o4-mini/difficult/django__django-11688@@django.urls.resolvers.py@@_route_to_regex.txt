[THOUGHT]
1. The output regex has two named groups: `lang` with pattern `[^/]+` and `url` with pattern `.+`.  
2. A `[^/]+` pattern comes from the default “str” converter (used when no converter is specified in `<...>`).  
3. A `.+` pattern comes from the “path” converter.  
4. Therefore the original route must have been `"<lang>/<path:url>/"`.  
5. The trailing `\\/$` and the presence of `$` in the output indicate that `is_endpoint=True` was passed.  
6. No other arguments or keyword arguments are used.
