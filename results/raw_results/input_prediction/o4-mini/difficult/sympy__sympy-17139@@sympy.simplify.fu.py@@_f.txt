[THOUGHT]
The helper `_f(rv)` begins by checking `if not (rv.is_Pow and rv.base.func == f): return rv`.  
Since the output is the Mul `-I*sin(x)`, which is not a `Pow`, the function must have just returned its argument unchanged.  
Therefore the input `rv` must itself have been the SymPy expression `-I*sin(x)`.  
No kwargs or `self` state are required.
