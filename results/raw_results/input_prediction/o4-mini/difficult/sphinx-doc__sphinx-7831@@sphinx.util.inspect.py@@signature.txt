[THOUGHT]
The output “(arg, kwarg=None)” is exactly what you get when Python’s inspect.signature returns a Signature object with parameters:
- a positional parameter named “arg”
- a keyword parameter “kwarg” defaulting to None

Because inspect.signature first looks for a __signature__ attribute on the callable, the simplest way to get that exact output is to pass in an object whose __signature__ attribute is already set to a Signature with those parameters. The signature() function then just returns that signature unchanged, and str() of it is “(arg, kwarg=None)”.

Therefore, in the input structure, subject.__signature__ must be that Signature, which we can represent as "(arg, kwarg=None)" in this JSON-like form. There are no kwargs and self is unused (empty).
