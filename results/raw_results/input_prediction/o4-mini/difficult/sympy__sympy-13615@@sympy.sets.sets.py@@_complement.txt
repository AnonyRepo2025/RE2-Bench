[THOUGHT]
The output is a FiniteSet whose internal `_elements` is `frozenset({10, 15})`. In the `_complement` method, when `other` is a `FiniteSet`, it returns a `FiniteSet` of those elements of `other` not contained in `self`. To get exactly `{10, 15}` in the result, the simplest case is that `other` itself has `_elements = frozenset({10, 15})` and `self.contains(10)` and `self.contains(15)` are both `False`. Therefore the input `other._elements` must be `frozenset({10, 15})`. The `self` object has no relevant internal state here, and there are no keyword arguments.
