[THOUGHT]
The `stop` method returns `True` only if `self.current_song` is truthy (i.e., not `None`). To produce `true` as the output, we must initialize `current_song` with some non-`None` value. The other fields can be set to reasonable defaultsâ€”e.g. a playlist containing that song and the default volume of 50.
