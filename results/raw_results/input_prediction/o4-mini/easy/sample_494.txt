We need f(num, l) to return "001". The function pads `num` with leading zeros until its length reaches `l`. Let’s try num = "1" (length 1) and l = 3:
- t = ""
- while 3 > 1: add "0" → t = "0", decrement l to 2
- while 2 > 1: add "0" → t = "00", decrement l to 1
- now 1 > 1 is false, exit loop
- return t + num = "00" + "1" = "001"
This matches the desired output.
