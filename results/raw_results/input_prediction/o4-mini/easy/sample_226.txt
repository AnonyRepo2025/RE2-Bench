[THOUGHT]
The function loops over i in range(len(nums)) where len(nums) is evaluated once at the start. Any nums.append during the loop does not extend the iteration.

After the loop, nums == original_nums + [each nums[i] divisible by 3].

We need final nums = [1, 3, 3]. Let original length be n, and k be the number of divisible-by-3 elements among the first n entries, so n + k = 3.

Try n = 2, then k = 1. So original list has 2 elements and exactly one is divisible by 3, whose value must be 3, and the other non‚Äêdivisible element must be 1 to get [1,3] as the start. Appending that single 3 gives [1,3,3].

Thus the input nums must be [1, 3].
