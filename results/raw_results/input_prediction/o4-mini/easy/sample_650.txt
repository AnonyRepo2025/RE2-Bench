[THOUGHT]
The function repeatedly strips `substring` from the start of `string` as long as `string.startswith(substring)` remains true. To end up with `""`, the original `string` must be exactly `substring` repeated N times (for some N ≥ 1), and `substring` cannot be empty (otherwise the loop never terminates). 

For example, if `substring = "a"` and `string = "aaa"`, then:
- `"aaa".startswith("a")` is true, strip one `"a"` → `"aa"`
- `"aa".startswith("a")` is true, strip one `"a"` → `"a"`
- `"a".startswith("a")` is true, strip one `"a"` → `""`
- `"" .startswith("a")` is false, loop ends, returns `""`

Thus one valid input is:
- string: "aaa"
- substring: "a"
