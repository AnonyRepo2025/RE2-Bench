[THOUGHT]
The method returns True only if the provided username is already a key in self.users.  
After a successful sign_in, self.users[username] is set to True.  
To go from some initial value to output `true`, the username must be present (so sign_in returns True) and then gets set to True.  
We have one user key "user1", so the call must be sign_in("user1").  
Before the call, users["user1"] could be False (not yet signed in), and then becomes True.  
Thus:
- self.users = {"user1": False}
- username = "user1"
- no kwargs
