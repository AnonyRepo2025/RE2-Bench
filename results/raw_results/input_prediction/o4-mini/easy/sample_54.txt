[THOUGHT]
We need f(text, s, e) to return 1. The function does:
  sublist = text[s:e]
  return sublist.index(min(sublist))
So the minimum element in sublist must be at index 1 of sublist. Also sublist must be non‐empty and have length ≥ 2.  

Simplest choice: let text = [3, 1], s = 0, e = 2. Then sublist = [3, 1], min(sublist) = 1, and its index in sublist is 1. Thus f returns 1 as required.
