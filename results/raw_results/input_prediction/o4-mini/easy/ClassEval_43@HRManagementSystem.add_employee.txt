[THOUGHT]
The method returns False exactly when the given `employee_id` is already a key in `self.employees`. The output is `false`, so the call must have used an `employee_id` that already exists. The structure shows `self.employees` has a single entry with key `"1"`. Therefore the call must have used `employee_id` = 1 (or `"1"`). The other fields (`name`, `position`, `department`, `salary`) can be any values; to simulate re-adding the same employee, we can reuse the existing values.
