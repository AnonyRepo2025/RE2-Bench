[THOUGHT]
The function f returns the original list argument unchanged. Since the observed output is [6, 4, 2, 8, 15], the original list passed in must have been [6, 4, 2, 8, 15]. The function also takes an operation which is called on the sorted copy, but since f returns the original list regardless of what operation does, operation can be any callable accepting a list. A simple choice is the built-in print function.
