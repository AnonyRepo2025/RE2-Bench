[THOUGHT]
The function f removes the first n occurrences of substring b from a, then returns the resulting string. We need f(a, b, n) == "unrndqafi".

We look for a minimal non‚Äêtrivial example:
- Let b = "un" and n = 1.
- Then a must start with two copies of "un" so that removing the first one leaves "unrndqafi".
- If a = "ununrndqafi", removing the first "un" gives "unrndqafi" as required.

Thus:
a = "ununrndqafi"
b = "un"
n = 1
