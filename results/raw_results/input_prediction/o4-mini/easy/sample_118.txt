[THOUGHT]
The function removes all occurrences of `chars` (once) and then `chars*2` from the input text. To get the output exactly equal to the given string `"zbzquiuqnmfkx"`, the simplest choice is to pick a `chars` value that does not appear in that string at all. In that case, neither `chars` nor `chars*2` occur in `text`, so the replace calls do nothing and the output remains unchanged.

Thus:
- text = "zbzquiuqnmfkx"
- chars = "a"  (since "a" is not in the text)

With these inputs, the function will return the original text unchanged, matching the desired output.
