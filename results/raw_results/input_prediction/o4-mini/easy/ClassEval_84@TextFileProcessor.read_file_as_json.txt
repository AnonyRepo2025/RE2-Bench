[THOUGHT]
The method `read_file_as_json` takes no arguments and returns whatever is in the JSON file at `self.file_path`. Since the observed output is the number `12345`, the file must contain the bare JSON value `12345`. Therefore, the only input is the `file_path` provided when instantiating `TextFileProcessor`. No args or kwargs are used.
