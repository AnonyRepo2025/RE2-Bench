[THOUGHT]
We need a string such that `string.title().replace(' ', '')` yields `"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"`.

1. The final output has two hyphens, so the input must have exactly two hyphens in those positions.
2. Hyphens are not removed by `replace(' ', '')`, and in `title()` they act as word boundaries: the character after each hyphen is capitalized.
3. We see in the central segment `"ErrBzz"` that both the E and the B are uppercase. `title()` only capitalizes the first letter of each word and lowercases the rest. To get the B uppercase, there must have been a word boundary just before it that isnâ€™t a hyphen (since we only want two hyphens). The only other boundary is a space.
4. If the input is `"1oe-err bzz-bmm"`:
   - `title()` -> `"1Oe-Err Bzz-Bmm"`
   - `replace(' ', '')` -> `"1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm"`
   which matches exactly.

Thus the input string must have been `"1oe-err bzz-bmm"`.
