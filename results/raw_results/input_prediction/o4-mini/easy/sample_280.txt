[THOUGHT]
The function replaces every '1' in the input with 'i' and leaves '0' and spaces unchanged. To recover the original input, we need to replace each 'i' in the output with '1'. 

Output:  
"00000000 00000000 0ii0ii00 0ii00i0i 0ii0iii0"

Replacing i → 1:

- "00000000" → "00000000"
- "00000000" → "00000000"
- "0ii0ii00" → "01101100"
- "0ii00i0i" → "01100101"
- "0ii0iii0" → "01101110"

Joined with spaces, the original `text` argument is:
"00000000 00000000 01101100 01100101 01101110"
