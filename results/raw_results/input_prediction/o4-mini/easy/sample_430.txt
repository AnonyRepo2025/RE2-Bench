[THOUGHT]
The function simply concatenates arr1 and arr2. The output list is:
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]

A natural split is that arr1 contains the initial homogeneous integers [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], and arr2 contains the remaining mixed elements ["", 0, -1, []]. Extending arr1 with arr2 yields exactly the output.
