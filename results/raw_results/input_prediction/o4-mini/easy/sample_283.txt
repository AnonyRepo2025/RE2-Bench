[THOUGHT]
The function deletes the given key and then returns either the original key or, if the original key equals the lexicographically smallest remaining key, the first key in insertion order.

Since in the provided dictionary the keys are fixed (“Captain America”, “Black Panther”, “Thor”, “Ant-Man”), deleting any one of those will leave a remaining set whose minimum is never the deleted key. In every valid case the function would just return the original key.

To get the output "Iron Man", the only possibility is that the original `key` argument was "Iron Man" (so the function simply returns it unchanged). The values in the dictionary never affect the result, so we can fill them with arbitrary placeholders, e.g. 0.
