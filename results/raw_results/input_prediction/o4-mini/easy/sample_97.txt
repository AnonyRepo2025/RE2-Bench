[THOUGHT]
The function first clears the list (`lst.clear()`), so whatever the original contents, `lst` becomes empty. Then the `for` loop over `lst` has no iterations, so the `else` branch executes and returns `True`. Thus any list (empty or not) as input will produce `True`. The simplest choice is an empty list.
