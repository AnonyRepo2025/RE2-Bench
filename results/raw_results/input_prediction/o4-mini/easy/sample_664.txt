[THOUGHT]
The function f builds a string by iterating over the keys of the `tags` dict and concatenating each key plus a space. To get the output `"3 4 "`, the dict must have exactly the keys `"3"` and `"4"`, in that order. The values associated with those keys are never accessed, so they can be anything. We will choose empty strings for simplicity.
