[THOUGHT]
We need text and position such that f(text, position) returns "udbs l".

Let output O = "udbs l" (length 6). The function removes one character at index = position % (len(text)+1), unless position<0, which forces index = -1 (removing the last char).

So the original text T must be length 7, and removing T[index] yields O.

We look for a simple T. Noting O has one space between 's' and 'l', a natural T is to have two spaces there: "udbs  l" (7 chars). If we remove one of those spaces, we get "udbs l". In T = 'u','d','b','s',' ',' ','l', the two spaces are at indices 4 and 5. Removing index 4 yields exactly O.

So index = 4. Since len(T) = 7, length+1 = 8, so position % 8 must be 4. The simplest nonnegative position is 4.

Thus a valid input is text = "udbs  l" (with two spaces), position = 4.
