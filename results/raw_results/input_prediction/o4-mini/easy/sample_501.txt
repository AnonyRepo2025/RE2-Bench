The output is "jqjfj zm". Let’s denote this as the final result R of length 8, indices 0..7:
 R = ['j','q','j','f','j',' ','z','m'].

The code finds index = text.rindex(char), then for i = index, index-2, … while >0, does:
 result[i] = result[i-1]; result[i-1] = char

Each swap moves the char into position i-1 and shifts the previous char right, duplicating the char at each swap. In the final R, the moved char appears at multiple positions: every (i-1) for i in the swap sequence.

Looking at R, the character 'j' appears at positions 0, 2, 4. That suggests the swap indices were i = 5,3,1 (so that char placed at positions 4,2,0). Hence the initial rindex(char) = 5, and char = 'j'.

To recover the original text T, invert the swaps in reverse order: swap R[1]<->R[0], then R[3]<->R[2], then R[5]<->R[4]:
 Start R = [j,q,j,f,j,' ',z,m]
 i=1: swap 0↔1 → [q,j,j,f,j,' ',z,m]
 i=3: swap 2↔3 → [q,j,f,j,j,' ',z,m]
 i=5: swap 4↔5 → [q,j,f,j,' ',j,z,m]

So the original text is "qjfj jzm" and char = "j". Calling f("qjfj jzm", "j") indeed yields "jqjfj zm".
