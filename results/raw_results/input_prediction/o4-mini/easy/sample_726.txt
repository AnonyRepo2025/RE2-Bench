[THOUGHT]
The function f(text) returns (number of whitespace chars, total length of text). We need ws = 2 and len(text) = 34. Any string of length 34 with exactly two whitespace characters will work.  
One simple choice is 16 "a" characters, then a space, then 16 "b" characters, then a space.  
"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb " has length 16 + 1 + 16 + 1 = 34, and exactly 2 spaces.  
Thus this input will produce (2, 34).
