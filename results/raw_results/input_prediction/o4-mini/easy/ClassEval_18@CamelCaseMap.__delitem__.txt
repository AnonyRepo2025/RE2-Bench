[THOUGHT]
The `__delitem__` method does:
1. Calls `_convert_key(key)`.  
   - If `key` is a string, it would invoke `_to_camel_case`, which we don’t have here.
   - If `key` is not a string, it just returns `key` unchanged.
2. Deletes `self._data[converted_key]`.
3. Returns `None` (shown as `null` in JSON).

Since the observed output is `null` and we see no errors, the simplest assumption is that the test passed a non-string key (so no string conversion branch is exercised) and that `del` completed (we’re not actually verifying existence in this question). A typical choice is an integer key.

Thus the input `key` must be a non-string, e.g. `1`.
