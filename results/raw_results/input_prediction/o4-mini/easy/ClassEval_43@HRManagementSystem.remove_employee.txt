[THOUGHT]
The `remove_employee` method looks for `employee_id` in `self.employees`. The output is false, so the provided `employee_id` must not match the existing key `"1"`. Any other key will cause the method to return False. Iâ€™ll supply a single employee with ID `"1"` and realistic details, and use `"2"` as the `employee_id` argument.
