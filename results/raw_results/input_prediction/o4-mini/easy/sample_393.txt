We have f(text):
1. ls = text[::-1]
2. Loop over i in range(len(ls)-3, 0, -3), which for a single iteration requires len(ls) ≤ 6 and > 3. The only i is i = len(ls)-3.
3. In that one iteration we take ls[i:i+3] (the last 3 chars of ls), join with '---', append '---', then strip the final '---'.
4. The output is "a---c---s", so the slice ls[i:i+3] must be ['a','c','s'] in that order.
5. Since i = len(ls)-3, ls[-3]='a', ls[-2]='c', ls[-1]='s'.
6. But ls = reversed text, so
   - ls[-1] = text[0] = 's'
   - ls[-2] = text[1] = 'c'
   - ls[-3] = text[2] = 'a'
7. We need len(text)=len(ls) between 4 and 6 to have exactly one iteration. The minimal is 4. Let text = "scaX" (with X arbitrary, say 'x').
8. Verify:
   text="scax"; ls="xacs"; i=4-3=1; ls[1:4]=['a','c','s']; join → "a---c---s"; done.

Thus a valid input is text = "scax".
