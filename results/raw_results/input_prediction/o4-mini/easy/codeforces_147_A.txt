[THOUGHT]
We need an original string s such that after:
1. Inserting a space after every occurrence of , . ? !  
2. Collapsing all whitespace to single spaces and trimming ends  
3. Removing any space immediately before those punctuation marks  

we end up with:  
“physicist? mathematician. astronomer”

The simplest way is to start with no spaces around the punctuation, e.g.
s₀ = "physicist?mathematician.astronomer"

Simulating:

1. After replace('.', '. ') and replace('?', '? '):
   "physicist? mathematician. astronomer"
2. Collapsing whitespace: unchanged
3. Removing spaces before punctuation: none present

Yields exactly the target output.
