We need f(line, char) → "$$78$$".

Let’s assume char is a single character (since str.center’s fillchar must be length 1). The function:
 count = line.count(char)
 for i in range(count+1, 0, -1):
     line = line.center(len(line) + i//1, char)  # i//1 = i

Total padding added = sum_{i=1 to count+1} i = (count+1)(count+2)/2,
so final length = len(original line) + (count+1)(count+2)/2.

Our target output "$$78$$" has length 6. We look for original line length n and count k such that
 n + (k+1)(k+2)/2 = 6
and k = number of char in the original line.

Test k=1: then padding = (1+1)(1+2)/2 = 2*3/2 = 3, so n = 6−3 = 3. That requires the original line be length 3 and contain exactly one char.

Now, to match the final content, the original line must be "$78":
 - Original line = "$78" (length 3, count of "$" is 1).
Simulate:
  count=1 → i runs 2,1
  i=2: center width=3+2=5 with '$' ⇒ "$78" → "$$78$"
  i=1: center width=5+1=6 with '$' ⇒ "$$78$" → "$$78$$"

This matches the output. Therefore:
 line = "$78"
 char = "$"
