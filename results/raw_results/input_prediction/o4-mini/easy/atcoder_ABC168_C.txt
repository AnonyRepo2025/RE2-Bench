The code computes the positions of the hour and minute hands on circles of radii a and b, at angles  
  θ_h = 2.5π – 2π·((h + m/60)/12)  
  θ_m = 2.5π – 2π·(m/60)  
and then prints the Euclidean distance between those two points.  

For the output to be 0.0, the two points must coincide:  
  a must equal b (same radius)  
and  
  θ_h must equal θ_m (same angle).  

Solve θ_h = θ_m:
  2.5π – 2π·((h + m/60)/12) = 2.5π – 2π·(m/60)  
⇔ (h + m/60)/12 = m/60  
⇔ h + m/60 = (12 m)/60 = m/5  
⇔ h = m/5 – m/60 = (12m – m)/60 = (11m)/60  
Since h,m are integers, the only solution with m, h integers and 0≤m<60 is m=0 ⇒ h=0.  

Thus choose m=0, h=0, and any a=b. The simplest is a=1, b=1.
