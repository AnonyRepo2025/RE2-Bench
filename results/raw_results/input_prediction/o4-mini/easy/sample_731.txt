[THOUGHT]
The function simply does text.replace(use, '').  
The output is  
"Chris requires  ride to the irport on Fridy."  
Note:
- There are two spaces between "requires" and "ride", indicating a single-character removal that left two adjacent spaces.
- "airport" → "irport" and "Friday" → "Fridy", both missing the letter "a".
Removing every "a" from  
"Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday."  
yields exactly the provided output.  
Therefore:
text = "Chris requires a ride to the airport on Friday."
use = "a"
