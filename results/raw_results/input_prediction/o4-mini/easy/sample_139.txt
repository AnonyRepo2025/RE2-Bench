[THOUGHT]
The function begins by checking if either list is shorter than 10 elements:
    if len(first) < 10 or len(second) < 10:
        return 'no'
Since the observed output is "no", we can trigger this immediately by supplying either list with length less than 10. The simplest choice is to use empty lists for both `first` and `second`, ensuring `len(first) = 0 < 10` and thus returning 'no' without further checks.
