[THOUGHT]
The function returns the index of the first newline in the string. Given the output 33, the newline character must be at position 33 (0-based), so there must be exactly 33 characters before the first `\n`. The simplest reconstruction is to use 33 `a` characters followed by `\n`. This string will make `file.index('\n')` return 33.
