[THOUGHT]
The function f repeatedly does a right-split on txt by sep up to sep_count times and then recombines head+sep and tail. However, after the first split, txt becomes the tail (which has no further seps), so the loop can run at most once and recombines to exactly the original txt. If sep_count is 0, it immediately returns txt unchanged. In all cases f(txt, sep, sep_count) == txt.

Since the observed output is "i like you", txt must have been "i like you". sep and sep_count can be anything valid; the simplest choice is sep = " " and sep_count = 1.
