The `get_variance` method computes the population variance via `np.var(self.data)` and rounds to two decimals. We need a data array whose variance is exactly 1.25 before rounding. 

Let’s try data = [1, 2, 3, 4]:
- Mean = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 2.5
- Squared deviations = [(1–2.5)², (2–2.5)², (3–2.5)², (4–2.5)²] = [2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25]
- Sum = 5.0
- Population variance = 5.0 / 4 = 1.25
- Rounded to 2 decimals → 1.25

This matches the given output. Therefore, `self.data` must be [1, 2, 3, 4].
