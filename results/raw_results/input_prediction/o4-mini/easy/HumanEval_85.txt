[THOUGHT]
The function sums every element at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) of lst, but only if that element is even. We need the sum to be 12.
The simplest way is to have exactly one even element at index 1 equal to 12, and no other qualifying elements. For example, lst = [0, 12] yields:
  indices considered: 1
  lst[1] = 12, which is even
  sum = 12
This matches the required output.
