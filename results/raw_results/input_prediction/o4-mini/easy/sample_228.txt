[THOUGHT]
The function does:
1. `text.lower()`
2. `.split()` on whitespace â†’ a list of words
3. `splitter.join(...)` to combine them.

The output is "llthh#saflapkphtswp". There is exactly one "#" in the result, so `splitter` must be "#" and there were two words.

Splitting the output at "#" yields ["llthh", "saflapkphtswp"]. Those are the lowercased words.

Thus after `text.lower().split()` we must get ["llthh", "saflapkphtswp"]. The simplest `text` producing that is "llthh saflapkphtswp" (any casing works since it's lowercased).

So:
- text = "llthh saflapkphtswp"
- splitter = "#"
