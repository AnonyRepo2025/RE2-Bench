[THOUGHT]
1. The method signature is make_random_password(self, length=10, allowed_chars=...).  
2. The output “PNFHWJjwvd” is 10 characters long, so it must have been called with the default length=10 and default allowed_chars.  
3. Therefore args and kwargs are empty.  
4. The self object is just an instance of BaseUserManager; its internal fields (_constructor_args, creation_counter, model, name, _db) can be filled with typical defaults (empty list or zero or null).
