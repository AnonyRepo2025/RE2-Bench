[THOUGHT]
The code reads a single line, splits into two tokens a and b_str.
It then transforms b_str via b = b_str[0] + b_str[2:], converts both to int, and computes a * b // 100.
To get output 0, we need a * b < 100.
The simplest choice is a = 0, since 0 * b = 0 regardless of b.
We must ensure b_str has at least 2 characters so that b_str[0] exists and b_str[2:] (which may be empty) is valid.
If b_str = "12", then b = "1" + "" = "1", int(b)=1. Then 0*1//100 = 0.
Thus the input line "0 12" yields the desired output 0.
