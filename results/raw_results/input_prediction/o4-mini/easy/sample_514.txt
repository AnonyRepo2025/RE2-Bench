[THOUGHT]
We want f(text) to return "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.".

f works by:
1. Splitting the original text into items = text.split().
2. For each item, removing any occurrences of "-item" and "item-" in the evolving text.
3. Finally stripping leading/trailing hyphens.

If we choose the input text to be exactly "stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.", then:
- items = ["stew---corn-and-beans-in", "soup-."].
- Neither "-stew---corn-and-beans-in" nor "stew---corn-and-beans-in-" nor "-soup-." nor "soup-.-" appear in the text, so no replacements occur.
- strip('-') removes only hyphens at the very start or end; our string starts with 's' and ends with '.', so nothing is stripped.

Hence f(text) returns the original string unchanged, matching the desired output. Therefore the input must be the same as the output.
