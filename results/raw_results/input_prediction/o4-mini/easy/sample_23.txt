[THOUGHT]
We need f(text, chars) to return "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2." 
The function strips trailing characters:
- If chars is truthy, it does text.rstrip(chars), removing any chars in that set.
  But our output ends with a period, so if period were in chars, it would be stripped off.
- If chars is falsy (e.g. empty string), it does text.rstrip(' '), removing only spaces.
Thus the simplest is to pass chars = "" (falsy), and have the original text end in one or more spaces. After rstrip(' '), those spaces go away, leaving the desired output intact.
So set text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. " (with a trailing space) and chars = "".
