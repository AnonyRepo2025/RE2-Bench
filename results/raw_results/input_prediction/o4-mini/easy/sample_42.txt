[THOUGHT]
The function first calls nums.clear(), which empties the list in place. Then it iterates over nums, but since nums is now empty, the loop body never runs and no elements are appended. Finally it returns nums, which is the empty list [].
Thus for any input list, f(nums) will return []. We can choose a simple non-empty list to illustrate this, e.g. [1, 2, 3].
