[THOUGHT]
The method `_eval_is_finite` looks at `self.args[0].is_finite` and returns that. To get an output of `true`, the first (and only) argument must be a sympy object whose `is_finite` attribute is `True` (for example `S(1)` or any integer/rational).  
The given structure has no `XXX` placeholders to fill, so we emit it unchanged.
