[THOUGHT]
The `list_employees` method builds its return value from `self.employees`. For each `employee_id, employee_info` pair:
- It sets `employee_ID` to the `employee_id` key.
- It then copies all key/value pairs from `employee_info`.

The desired output has a single entry keyed by `"1"` (serialized JSON key) with `"employee_ID": 1` and the fields `"name": "John"`, `"position": "Manager"`, `"department": "Sales"`, `"salary": 100000`. To produce that:
- `self.employees` must contain one entry with key `1` (so `employee_ID` becomes integer 1).
- Its value must be a dict with exactly those fields.

There are no positional or keyword arguments for `list_employees`, so `args` and `kwargs` stay empty.
