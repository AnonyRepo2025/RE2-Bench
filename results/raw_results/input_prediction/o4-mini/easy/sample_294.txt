[THOUGHT]
We need f(n,m,text) to produce "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris". The function effectively does a global replace of n → m on text. Let’s see if text was “chris” and n = "c":
 head = "c", mid = "hri", tail = "s".
Replacing "c" with some m yields m + "hri" + "s". We want that to equal the output. So m must be the substring from the start of the output up to just before "hri". In the output "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1hris", the "hri" starts at position 15. The prefix of length 15 is "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1". That is m. Then + "hri" + "s" matches exactly. Therefore:
 n = "c"
 m = "2$z&5H3*1a@#a*1"
 text = "chris"
