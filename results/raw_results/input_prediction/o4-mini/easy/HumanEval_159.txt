[THOUGHT]
The function returns [number+need, remaining-need] when need ≤ remaining. We see the output is [12, 1], so:

number + need = 12  
remaining - need = 1  

From the second equation, remaining = need + 1. Substituting into the first gives number = 12 - need.

Choosing the simplest positive integer need = 1 yields remaining = 2 and number = 11. This satisfies need ≤ remaining and reproduces the output.
