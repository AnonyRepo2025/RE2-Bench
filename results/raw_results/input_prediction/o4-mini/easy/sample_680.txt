[THOUGHT]
The function `f` returns only alphanumeric characters from the input string in order. The output is `"we32r71g72ug94823658324"`, which contains only alphanumeric characters. The simplest way to produce this output is to pass the same string as `text`, since no characters need to be filtered out.
