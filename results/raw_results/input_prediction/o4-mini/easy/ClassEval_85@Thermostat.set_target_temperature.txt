[THOUGHT]
The method set_target_temperature simply assigns a new value to self.target_temperature and returns None, which corresponds to null in JSON. The output being null tells us nothing about the specific input valuesâ€”they could be any valid numbers and mode. We just need a plausible Thermostat state and a temperature argument.

For example:
- current_temperature = 20
- target_temperature = 22
- mode = "cool"
- calling set_target_temperature(24)

This will return None (null) as observed.
