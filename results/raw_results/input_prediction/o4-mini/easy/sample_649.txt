[THOUGHT]
The output lines each start with exactly one space before the text (e.g. " f9"). That suggests each original line began with a single tab character (`\t`) which was expanded to one space. Pythonâ€™s `expandtabs(n)` replaces a tab with enough spaces to move to the next multiple of `n`. To get exactly one space from a tab, `n` must be 1. 

Therefore:
- `tabsize` = 1
- `text` must be the four lines each beginning with `\t`: "\tf9\n\tldf9\n\tadf9!\n\tf9?"
