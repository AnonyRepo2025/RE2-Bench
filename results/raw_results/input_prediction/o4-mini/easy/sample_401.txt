[THOUGHT]
We need f(text, suffix) to return "mathematics".  
The function returns text[:-len(suffix)] if suffix is truthy and text ends with suffix, otherwise it returns text unmodified.  
The simplest way to get "mathematics" back is to pass suffix="" (an empty string). Since "" is falsey, the `if` condition is skipped and the function returns text unchanged.  
Therefore, use text="mathematics" and suffix="".
