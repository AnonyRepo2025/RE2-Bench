[THOUGHT]
The method returns None only if it does not hit any `return` statement.  
1. The first `if` returns False if `room_type` is not in `self.booked_rooms`. To avoid that, `room_type` must be a key in `booked_rooms`, which per structure is `"single"`.  
2. Next, it checks `if name in self.booked_rooms[room_type]`. Since `booked_rooms["single"]` is an empty dict, any name will not be found. That means the block (which contains the other returns) is skipped entirely.  
3. Falling off the end of the method yields `None` (printed as `null`).  

Therefore, choose:
- room_type = "single"
- room_number = any integer (e.g. 1)
- name = any string (e.g. "Alice")  
And fill out `self` with a hotel name and available_rooms consistent with the structure.
