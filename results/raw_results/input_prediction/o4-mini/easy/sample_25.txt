[THOUGHT]
The function makes a shallow copy of d, then popitem() removes the last inserted key-value pair. The output has only "l":1 and "t":2, so the removed item must have been the third key in insertion order. Thus the original dict must have had keys "l", "t", and "x:", with values 1 and 2 for "l" and "t" so they remain. The value for "x:" can be anything (weâ€™ll choose 3). After popitem removes ("x:", 3), the returned dict is {"l":1, "t":2}, matching the output.
