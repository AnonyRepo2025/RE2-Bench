The `_parallel_fit_estimator` function simply takes:

- an unfitted estimator instance,
- the feature matrix X,
- the target vector y,
- and an optional sample_weight (which in our case is not provided, so it will be None).

After fitting, the output shows that the estimator ended up with

  penalty="l2",
  dual=False,
  tol=0.0001,
  C=1.0,
  fit_intercept=True,
  intercept_scaling=1,
  class_weight=None,
  random_state=123,
  solver="warn",
  max_iter=100,
  multi_class="warn",
  verbose=0,
  warm_start=False,
  n_jobs=None,
  l1_ratio=None,

and sample_weight was not used (i.e. was None).

We do not know the exact contents of X and y from the output alone, only that y had at least the classes [0,1,2] and X had two features.  A minimal consistent choice is a 3Ã—2 array X and y = [0,1,2].  For example:

  X = [[1.0, 2.0],
       [3.0, 4.0],
       [5.0, 6.0]]
  y = [0, 1, 2]

With sample_weight omitted (None).

Thus the inputs to `_parallel_fit_estimator` must have been as follows.
