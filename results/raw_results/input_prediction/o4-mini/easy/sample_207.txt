[THOUGHT]
The function f iterates through the list `commands`, updating a dictionary `d` with each command dict. The final result is 
{"brown": 2, "blue": 5, "bright": 4}. A minimal way to produce this is to pass three dictionaries in order, each adding one key: [{"brown": 2}, {"blue": 5}, {"bright": 4}]. Merging them in sequence yields the desired output.
