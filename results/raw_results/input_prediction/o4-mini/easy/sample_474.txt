[THOUGHT]
The output string has two lines, split by “\n”. So txt.split('\n') must have produced two lines.
The returned lines are:
  a[0] = "#[)[]>[^e>"
  a[1] = " 8"

For each line, a.append(line.center(marker)) was used.

1. For a[1] to be " 8", original line2 must have been "8" (one character), and centered to a width of 2:
   - "8".center(2) pads one space on the left → " 8". So marker = 2.

2. For a[0] to remain "#[)[]>[^e>" unchanged, the original line1 must have length ≥ marker = 2, so center(2) returns the string unchanged. The original line1 is exactly "#[)[]>[^e>".

Thus txt was "#[)[]>[^e>\n8" and marker was 2.
