[THOUGHT]
We need `__mul__` to return `NotImplemented`. The code does this exactly when `isinstance(other, float)` is true. The value of `self.n` is irrelevant in that branch (it isnâ€™t even accessed before returning), so we can pick any integer for `self.n`. We choose, for example, `2`. To trigger the float check, we set `other` to a float, e.g. `3.14`. This will cause the method to immediately return `NotImplemented`.
