[THOUGHT]
The function splits the input text on whitespace to get a list of words, sorts that list in reverse (descending) lexicographical order, and then joins with spaces.

Given the output "loved a", the sorted list must be ["loved", "a"]. 
To get that after reverse sort, the two words involved are "loved" and "a". 
If the original list was ["a", "loved"], sorting in reverse yields ["loved", "a"], which joins to "loved a". 
(If the original list were already ["loved", "a"], the output would be the same, but the canonical unsorted input is "a loved".)

Therefore the input `text` should be "a loved".
