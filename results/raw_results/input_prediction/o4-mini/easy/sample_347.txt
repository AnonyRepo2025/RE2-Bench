Given output “hhhhhzcw”, length is 8. The function f does:
1. Let n = len(text).
2. For i in 0..n–1, insert at position i a copy of the element currently at ls[i].
3. After loop, ls has length 2n, consisting of (n+1) copies of the first character t0, followed by the original t1…t_{n–1}.
Thus output = t0*(n+1) + t1 + … + t_{n–1}, total length 2n.

Here 2n = 8 → n = 4. So text has 4 characters: t0 t1 t2 t3.
Output = t0 repeated 5 times, then t1,t2,t3 = “hhhhh” + “zcw”.
So t0 = 'h', t1 = 'z', t2 = 'c', t3 = 'w'. Hence text = "hzcw".
