[THOUGHT]
The output is "x0x0", which is 'x0' repeated n times. That means n must be 2.  
In the code, n = int(text.find('8')), so text.find('8') must return 2.  
Therefore the first occurrence of '8' in text must be at index 2.  
A minimal example is text = "ab8", since 'a' is index 0, 'b' is index 1, and '8' is index 2.
