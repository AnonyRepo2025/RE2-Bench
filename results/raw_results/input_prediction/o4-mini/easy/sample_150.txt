[THOUGHT]
Let the initial list be numbers = [n0, n1, n2] of length L = 3, and index = idx0.  
The code does:
- seq = numbers[idx0:]  (length m = L - idx0)
- For each element in seq, it inserts it back at position index and increments index.
- After m insertions, index_final = idx0 + m = idx0 + (3 - idx0) = 3.
- It returns numbers[:index_final] = numbers[:3].

Observe that after the insertions, the first 3 elements of numbers are exactly the original numbers [n0, n1, n2]. Hence the returned list equals the original numbers.  
Given the output is [-2, 4, -4], the original numbers must be [-2, 4, -4].  
Any initial index between 0 and 3 produces the same output; we choose the simplest, index = 0.
