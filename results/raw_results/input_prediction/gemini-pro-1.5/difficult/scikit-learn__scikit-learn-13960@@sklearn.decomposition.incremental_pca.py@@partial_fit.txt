Let's analyze the output and connect it to the code to determine the input for `partial_fit`.

1. **n_components, whiten, copy, batch_size:** These are directly reflected in the output, so we can fill these in:
   - `n_components`: null
   - `whiten`: false
   - `copy`: true
   - `batch_size`: 18

2. **batch_size_:** This is derived from `batch_size` and `n_features`. Since `batch_size` is 18 and `batch_size_` is also 18, it implies that `batch_size` was provided and not calculated based on `n_features`.

3. **n_samples_seen_:** The output shows 100, meaning the input `X` must have had 100 samples.

4. **mean_, var_:** These are the updated mean and variance after processing the input `X`.  The specific values give us clues about the distribution of `X`, but we can't directly reconstruct `X` from these.

5. **components_, singular_values_, explained_variance_, explained_variance_ratio_, noise_variance_:** These are all results of the SVD computation on the centered data.  Again, these don't directly tell us what `X` was.

6. **n_components_:** The output value is 3. Since `n_components` is null, `n_components_` is determined by `min(n_samples, n_features)`. Given `n_samples_seen_` is 100, this implies `n_features` must be 3.  Therefore, the input `X` must have a shape of (100, 3).

7. **X:** We know the shape of X is (100, 3). To get the exact values, we'd need to reverse the SVD and the centering process, which is complex. However, we can create a dummy input `X` with the correct shape and a distribution that would likely result in similar `mean_` and `var_`.  Let's use `np.random.rand(100, 3)` and then shift and scale it to match the given `mean_` and `var_` approximately.

8. **check_input:** This is a keyword argument, and its value is not directly reflected in the output.  We can assume it's `True` unless there's a reason to believe otherwise.
