1. The output string "LeavePGroupsOut(n_groups=3)" suggests that the `_build_repr` function is called on an instance of a class named "LeavePGroupsOut".
2. The output also shows that the representation includes the parameter "n_groups" with a value of 3.
3. The `_build_repr` function retrieves the arguments used to initialize the object and constructs a string representation.
4. Therefore, the input "self" should be an instance of a class (or a class with a similar structure) that has an attribute "n_groups" with a value of 3.
