[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code step by step to determine the input 'f' that results in the output '2*pi'.

The function `periodicity(f, symbol, check=False)` calculates the period of a function 'f' with respect to the symbol 'symbol'.  The output '2*pi' suggests a trigonometric function.

1. **Base Cases:** The function first checks if 'symbol' is not in 'f', returning 0. It then checks if 'f' is a `TrigonometricFunction`. If so, it attempts to get the period directly.  Common trigonometric functions like `sin(x)` and `cos(x)` have a period of 2*pi.

2. **Abs:** If 'f' is an `Abs` function, it tries to find the period of its argument.  For `Abs(sin(x))`, the period is pi, and for `Abs(cos(x))`, the period is pi.

3. **Pow, Mul, Add:** The code handles power, multiplication, and addition expressions, trying to extract the periodic part.

4. **Decomposition:** If none of the above cases apply, it uses `decompogen` to decompose the function and recursively find the period of its components.

Since the output is 2*pi, the simplest input would be a basic trigonometric function with this period.  Let's try `sin(x)` or `cos(x)`.
