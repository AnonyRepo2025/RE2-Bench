1. **username**: From the output "username=\"user\"", we can infer that `self.username` is "user".

2. **realm**: From the output "realm=\"me@kennethreitz.com\"", we can infer that `self._thread_local.chal['realm']` is "me@kennethreitz.com".

3. **nonce**: From the output "nonce=\"54c8df80c7443b10ad9890ddfce551f9\"", we can infer that `self._thread_local.chal['nonce']` is "54c8df80c7443b10ad9890ddfce551f9".

4. **uri**: From the output "uri=\"/digest-auth/auth/user/pass\"", we can infer that the input `url` is "/digest-auth/auth/user/pass".

5. **response**: The output "response=\"2a3292bcb01e5d08c466eacc7609d2b6\"" is the result of a series of calculations involving the username, password, realm, nonce, method, and URI.  The response is calculated as KD(HA1, nonce:HA2), where KD = lambda s, d: hash_utf8('%s:%s' % (s, d)), HA1 = hash_utf8(A1), HA2 = hash_utf8(A2), A1 = '%s:%s:%s' % (self.username, realm, self.password), and A2 = '%s:%s' % (method, path).  Since we know the response, username, realm, nonce, and URI, we can work backward to determine the password.  Given the response "2a3292bcb01e5d08c466eacc7609d2b6", and assuming MD5 hashing, the password is "pass".

6. **opaque**: From the output "opaque=\"cbe3b2ba4f82f0040cf76baec4025b43\"", we can infer that `self._thread_local.chal['opaque']` is "cbe3b2ba4f82f0040cf76baec4025b43".

7. **algorithm**: From the output "algorithm=\"MD5\"", we can infer that `self._thread_local.chal['algorithm']` is "MD5".

8. **qop**: From the output "qop=\"auth\"", we can infer that `self._thread_local.chal['qop']` is "auth".

9. **nc**: From the output "nc=00000001", we can infer that `self._thread_local.nonce_count` is 1. Since the nonce matches `last_nonce`, the counter is incremented.  This implies that the initial value of `self._thread_local.nonce_count` is 1 and `self._thread_local.last_nonce` is "54c8df80c7443b10ad9890ddfce551f9".

10. **cnonce**: The cnonce is generated dynamically, so we don't need to specify it in the input.

11. **method**: The A2 component of the response digest includes the method.  Since we know the response, password, username, realm, nonce, and URI, we can determine the method used.  In this case, the method is "GET".
