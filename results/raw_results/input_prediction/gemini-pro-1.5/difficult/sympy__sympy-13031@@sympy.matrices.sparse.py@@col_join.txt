Let's trace the execution of `col_join` to determine the input.

1. **Output _smat:** The output `_smat` has two entries: `(0, 0): 1` and `(1, 0): 2`. This suggests that the resulting matrix has 2 rows and 1 column.

2. **Shape of self and other:** The `col_join` operation joins matrices column-wise.  The final matrix has 2 rows and 1 column. This means `self` must have 0 rows and 1 column, and `other` must have 2 rows and 1 column.

3. **Values in other:** Since `other` is not a SparseMatrix, the code iterates through its `_mat` and adds the values to `self._smat`. The values in the output `_smat` directly correspond to the values in `other._mat`. Since the final matrix is 2x1, `other._mat` must be `[1, 2]`.

4. **Initial self:** Before the join, `self._smat` is empty, `self.rows` is 0, and `self.cols` is 1.

Therefore, the input should be:

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {
        "_smat": {},
        "rows": 0,
        "cols": 1
    },
    "args": {
        "other": {
            "rows": 2,
            "cols": 1,
            "_mat": [
                1,
                2
            ]
        }
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
[/INPUT]
