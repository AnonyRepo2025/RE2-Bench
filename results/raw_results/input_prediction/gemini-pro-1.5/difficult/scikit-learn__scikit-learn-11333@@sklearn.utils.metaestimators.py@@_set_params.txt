1. The output shows that `transformers` and `transformer_weights` are set to `null`. This means these attributes were likely passed as `None` in the input `kwargs`.
2. `remainder` is set to "drop". This means it was also likely passed as "drop" in the input `kwargs`.
3. `n_jobs` is set to 2. This means it was likely passed as 2 in the input `kwargs`.
4. The `attr` argument is "_transformers" as this is the attribute used in `_get_params` and `_set_params` within the `ColumnTransformer` class.

Therefore, the input should be:
