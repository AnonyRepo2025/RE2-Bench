Let's trace the execution of `sympify` to determine the input `a` that produces the output `{'_args_set': "{'2.00000000000000', '3'}"}`.

The output suggests that the input `a` is likely a `set` containing the elements that end up in `_args_set`.  The function attempts various conversions and simplifications.  Since the output contains a float representation of 2.0 and an integer representation of 3, the original set likely contained these values in a form that could be converted.

Here's a possible scenario:

1. **Input `a` is a set:** The code iterates through elements of `a` if it's iterable.
2. **Numeric elements:** The elements are likely numeric, as they are converted to float and int representations.
3. **Conversion to string:** The code contains a fallback mechanism to convert the input to a string if other conversions fail. This suggests the input might not be directly parsable as a SymPy expression.

Given these observations, a set containing the numeric values 2.0 and 3 seems like a plausible input.  Let's consider `a = {2.0, 3}`. The `sympify` function would iterate through this set, converting each element. The 2.0 would likely be kept as a float, while 3 would be converted to an integer.  The final set representation would then include the string representations of these values.
