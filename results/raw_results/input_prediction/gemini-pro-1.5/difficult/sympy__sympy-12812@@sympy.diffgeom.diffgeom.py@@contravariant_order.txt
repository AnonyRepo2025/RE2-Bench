Let's analyze the code and determine the input that produces an output of 2.

The function `contravariant_order` calculates the contravariant order of an expression.  A contravariant order of 2 suggests a tensor product of two contravariant vectors or a similar structure.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works and how we can achieve an order of 2:

1. **Add:** If the expression is a sum, the order is the order of each term (which must be the same).
2. **Mul:** If the expression is a product, only one term can have a non-zero order. The order is that of the non-zero term.
3. **Pow:** If the expression is a power, both the base and exponent must have zero contravariant and covariant order.
4. **BaseVectorField:** Returns 1. This is our building block.
5. **TensorProduct:** Returns the sum of the orders of its arguments.
6. **Other:** Returns 0 if it contains only scalar fields, -1 otherwise.

To get an output of 2, we can use a `TensorProduct` of two `BaseVectorField` instances.
