1. The output shape is (11, 2). `X` is multiplied by `_idf_diag`, so `_idf_diag` shape must be (2, 2) and `X` shape must be (11, 2).
2. The output `data` has 7 elements. This means the input `X` must have 7 non-zero elements.
3. The output `indices` is `[1 0 1 0 1 0 1]`. This corresponds to the column indices of the non-zero elements in the output `X`.
4. The output `indptr` is `[0 2 4 6 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7]`. This indicates the row indices of the non-zero elements. The difference between consecutive elements in `indptr` gives the number of non-zero elements in each row.
5. From `indptr`, we can deduce the following structure for input `X`:
   - Row 0: 2 non-zero values at columns 1 and 0
   - Row 1: 2 non-zero values at columns 1 and 0
   - Row 2: 2 non-zero values at columns 1 and 0
   - Row 3: 1 non-zero value at column 1
   - Rows 4-10: all zeros

6. Since `use_idf` is True, the values in `X` are multiplied by the corresponding values in `_idf_diag`.  Let's assume `norm` is 'l2'.

7. To determine the exact values of `X` and `_idf_diag`, we need to reverse the normalization and multiplication by `_idf_diag`. However, without knowing the exact values of `_idf_diag` and the normalization factors, we can only infer the structure and sparsity pattern of `X`.

8. Let's assume `_idf_diag` is an identity matrix for simplicity. Then, the input `X` before normalization would have the same values as the output `X`.

9. We can represent the input `X` as follows:

```
[[0, 1],
 [1, 0],
 [0, 1],
 [1, 0],
 [0, 1],
 [1, 0],
 [0, 1],
 [0, 0],
 [0, 0],
 [0, 0],
 [0, 0]]
```

However, the actual values in data will be different due to the tf-idf transformation. We can't determine the exact values without more information.
