1. The output `[null, "x**2"]` suggests that the `args` input is a tuple or list containing two elements. The first element is likely `None` or an empty iterable, resulting in `null` after preprocessing. The second element is related to the expression "x**2".

2. The expression "x**2" indicates that the `expr` input is likely `x**2` or an equivalent symbolic representation. Since the output is a string, the `_dummify` flag is likely `False`. If `_dummify` were `True`, the output would involve dummy variables.

3. Let's assume `args` is `(None, x)` and `expr` is `x**2`.
   - When processing `None`, `iterable(arg)` is false, and none of the `isinstance` checks are true. So, nothing is added to `argstrs`.
   - When processing `x`, `isinstance(arg, Symbol)` is true. Since `_dummify` is false, `argstrs.append(self._argrepr(arg))` is executed. Assuming `_argrepr` simply returns the string representation of the symbol, "x" is appended to `argstrs`.
   - The final `argstrs` would be `[null, "x"]` and `expr` remains `x**2`.

4. To match the output exactly, we can set `args` to `(None, x)` and `expr` to `x**2`.
