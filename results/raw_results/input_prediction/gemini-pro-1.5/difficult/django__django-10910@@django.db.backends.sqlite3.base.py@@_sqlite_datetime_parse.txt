1. The output is a datetime string with timezone information "+00:00".
2. Inside the function, `conn_tzname` is used to attach a timezone to the datetime object.
3. `tzname` is used to convert the datetime to the specified timezone. If `tzname` is different from `conn_tzname`, the datetime object is adjusted and localized.
4. In this case, the output has a timezone offset of +00:00, which suggests that either `tzname` and `conn_tzname` are the same or `tzname` is None.
5. Let's assume `tzname` is None and `conn_tzname` is 'UTC'. The input `dt` would be '2016-06-13 00:00:00'.
