1. The output contains "remainder__copy": true, "remainder__with_mean": true, "remainder__with_std": false. This suggests that `deep=True` and the `remainder` attribute has these parameters.
2. The output also contains the `remainder` object itself, with the same values for `copy`, `with_mean`, and `with_std`.
3. The output contains "n_jobs": 1, "transformer_weights": null, which are top-level parameters of the object.
4. The output contains "trans1": "passthrough". This suggests that `transformers` contains an item like `[('trans1', 'passthrough', ...)]`.
5. The `attr` argument determines which attribute is used to retrieve estimators. In this case, it's "transformers".
