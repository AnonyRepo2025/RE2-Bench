[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the execution flow of `_mapping_repr` to determine the required input to produce the given output.

1. **Output Structure:** The output string "Attributes:\n    foo:      bar" suggests that the `title` argument is "Attributes". The presence of "foo" indicates a single key-value pair in the `mapping` argument, with "foo" as the key. The value associated with "foo" determines the final part of the output string.

2. **`_mapping_repr` Logic:**
   - The function starts by creating a summary list with the `title`.
   - It checks if the `mapping` is empty. If not, it proceeds with formatting the key-value pairs.
   - The `_get_boolean_with_default` function is called with `expand_option_name`. Since the output shows the expanded form (not the summarized form like "Attributes: (1)"), we can infer that `expand_option_name` should be such that `_get_boolean_with_default` returns `True`.  Given the default value is True, and assuming OPTIONS['display_expand_attrs'] is 'default', the function will return True.
   - Inside the `if` block (since `mapping` is not empty), the code iterates through the `mapping.items()`. In our case, there's only one item ("foo": XXX).
   - The `summarizer` function is called for each item.  Although we don't have the exact implementation of `summarize_attr`, the output "    foo:      bar" suggests that it formats the key and value with some padding.  The default `summarizer` for `attrs_repr` is `summarize_attr`.

3. **Determining the value of XXX:** The output "    foo:      bar" implies that the `summarizer` function (likely `summarize_attr`) transforms the value associated with "foo" into "bar".  Therefore, the value XXX corresponding to the key "foo" should be "bar".
