1. The output shows that `func` is `sqrt` and `inverse_func` is `log`, and `transformer` is None.
2. The output `regressor` parameters match the default LinearRegression parameters.
3. The output `regressor_` contains fitted attributes like `coef_`, `intercept_`, etc. This indicates that a LinearRegression model was fitted. The shape of `coef_` (10,) suggests that `X` has 10 features.
4. The `_residues` value suggests a specific dataset was used for fitting.
5. `_training_dim` is 1, meaning `y` was 1D.

To reproduce the output, we need to create an `X` with 10 features and a `y` that, when transformed by `sqrt` and then fitted with a LinearRegression, results in the given `coef_` and `intercept_`.  Since we don't have enough information to precisely reconstruct `X` and `y`, we'll use placeholder arrays of the correct shape and assume they would produce the observed output after fitting.
