[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the `powdenest` function and its behavior to determine the input that produces the output "_x".

1. **Trivial Case:** The simplest input that could produce "_x" as output is "_x" itself.  If `eq` is "_x", the function essentially performs simplifications that don't alter a simple symbol.

2. **`powsimp` and Transformations:** The core of `powdenest` lies in the `powsimp` function and the application of a transformation using `_denest_pow`.  We need to consider cases where these operations might simplify to "_x".

3. **Force and Polar:** The `force` and `polar` arguments control specific simplification paths.  When `force` is True, more aggressive denesting is attempted. When `polar` is True, expressions are converted to polar form before simplification.  For the simplest case, let's assume both are False.

4. **No Nesting:** The main purpose of `powdenest` is to simplify nested powers (e.g., (x**a)**b to x**(a*b)). If there's no nesting, the function won't perform significant changes.

Therefore, the simplest input that results in "_x" is likely "_x" itself with `force` and `polar` set to False.
