The `__add__` method combines the `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` of `self` and `other`, but only adds items from `other` if they are not already present in `self`. The output shows that both `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` of the combined `Media` object are `null`. This means that either both `self` and `other` are empty, or `other` contains only elements that are already present in `self`.

Since the question asks for the input, we can assume the simplest case where both `self` and `other` are empty lists.
