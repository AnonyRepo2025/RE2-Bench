1. The output is a 1x1 matrix. This means both X and Y should have a single sample.
2. The output value is approximately 1.165. Let's assume X and Y are 1D arrays with a single feature each.
3. The formula for Euclidean distance is sqrt(sum((x_i - y_i)^2)). If squared is False, the output is the square root of the sum of squared differences. If squared is True, the output is just the sum of squared differences.
4. Let's assume squared is False. We need to find x and y such that sqrt((x - y)^2) = 1.165.
5. Squaring both sides, we get (x - y)^2 = 1.357. Taking the square root, we get |x - y| = 1.165.
6. Let's choose x = 0 and y = 1.165. Then |0 - 1.165| = 1.165.
7. Let's check with squared=False: euclidean_distances([[0]], [[1.165]], squared=False) should return approximately [[1.165]].
8. Let's check with squared=True: euclidean_distances([[0]], [[1.165]], squared=True) should return approximately [[1.357]].
