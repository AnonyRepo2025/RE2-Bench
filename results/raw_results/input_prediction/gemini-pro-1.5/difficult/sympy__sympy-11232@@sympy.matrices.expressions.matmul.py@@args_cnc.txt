Let's analyze the code step by step to determine the input that produces the given output.

The function `args_cnc` processes the arguments of a `MatMul` object. It separates scalar and matrix arguments, computes the canonical and non-canonical parts of the scalar coefficient, and returns a tuple containing these parts.

The output `[null, null]` indicates that both the canonical and non-canonical parts are empty. This means:

1. The scalar coefficient must be 1. This happens when there are no scalar arguments or the product of scalar arguments simplifies to 1.

2. There are no matrix arguments.

Therefore, the input `MatMul` object should either have no arguments or only the number 1 as an argument.
