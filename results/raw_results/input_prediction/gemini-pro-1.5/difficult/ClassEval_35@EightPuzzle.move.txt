The `move` function takes a state and a direction, and swaps the blank tile (0) with the tile in the specified direction. The output state is:

```
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [7, 0, 8],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
```

The blank tile is at position (1, 1).  Let's consider the possible moves that could have resulted in this state:

* **Up:** If the blank tile moved up, the previous state would have had the blank tile at (2, 1) and a 0 where the 5 currently is.  The previous state would be:

```
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [7, 5, 8],
    [4, 0, 3]
]
```

* **Down:** If the blank tile moved down, the previous state would have had the blank tile at (0, 1) and a 0 where the 6 currently is. The previous state would be:

```
[
    [1, 0, 2],
    [7, 6, 8],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
```

* **Left:** If the blank tile moved left, the previous state would have had the blank tile at (1, 2) and a 0 where the 8 currently is. The previous state would be:

```
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [7, 8, 0],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
```

* **Right:** If the blank tile moved right, the previous state would have had the blank tile at (1, 0) and a 0 where the 7 currently is. The previous state would be:

```
[
    [1, 6, 2],
    [0, 7, 8],
    [4, 5, 3]
]
```
