1. **n_samples:** The output shows 176 samples (88 samples per class). Thus, `n_samples = 176`.
2. **n_features:** The output `X` has 2 features. Thus, `n_features = 2`.
3. **n_classes:** The output `y` has values 0, 1, 2, and 3. Thus, `n_classes = 4`.
4. **n_informative:** Since `n_features` is 2, `n_informative` must be <= 2. The data appears to be clustered based on the first two features, suggesting that both features are informative. Thus, `n_informative = 2`.
5. **n_redundant and n_repeated:** Since `n_features` is 2 and `n_informative` is 2, there are no redundant or repeated features. Thus, `n_redundant = 0` and `n_repeated = 0`.
6. **n_clusters_per_class:** The output `X` seems to have two distinct clusters per class. Thus, `n_clusters_per_class = 2`.
7. **weights:** The output has 44 samples for each class, suggesting equal weights. Thus, `weights = None`.
8. **flip_y:** The output `y` shows clear separation between classes, suggesting no flipping. Thus, `flip_y = 0.0`.
9. **class_sep:** The distance between clusters appears large. A value of `class_sep = 1.0` would result in centroids being multiplied by 2, which aligns with the observed separation.
10. **hypercube:** The clusters appear to be roughly spherical, suggesting `hypercube = True`.
11. **shift:** The data is centered around large negative values for the first feature and large positive values for the second feature. This suggests a shift. The exact shift values are approximately -250000 and 375000. Thus, `shift = [-250000, 375000]`.
12. **scale:** The data has a large range, suggesting scaling. The approximate scale values are 75000 and 115000. Thus, `scale = [75000, 115000]`.
13. **shuffle:** The data appears to be ordered by class. Thus, `shuffle = False`.
14. **random_state:** The exact values in the output depend on the random state. Let's assume `random_state = 0`.
