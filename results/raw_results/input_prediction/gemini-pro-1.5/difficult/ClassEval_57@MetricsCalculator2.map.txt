The output is `[0.0, [0.0]]`. This is the output when the input `data` is an empty list `[]` or when `data` is a tuple whose second element is 0, such as `([], 0)`.

Let's consider the case when the input is a tuple.
If `data` is `([], 0)`, then `total_num` is 0, and the function returns `(0.0, [0.0])`.

Let's consider the case when the input is a list.
If `data` is `[]`, an empty list, the loop is not executed, and `separate_result` remains empty. Then `np.mean(separate_result)` returns `nan`, which is not the expected output.

Therefore, the input must be a tuple `([], 0)`.
