1. **Epsilon, max_iter, alpha, warm_start, fit_intercept, tol:** These parameters are directly reflected in the output, so we can set them to the values provided in the output.
2. **n_iter_, scale_, intercept_, coef_, outliers_:** These are attributes set by the `fit` method, so we don't need to provide them in the input.
3. **X and y:** These are the input data. Determining their exact values is difficult without more information about the optimization process. However, we can infer some properties:
    - The shape of `X` determines the number of coefficients. The output shows `coef_` is a vector of length 21. Therefore, `X` has 21 columns (features).
    - The length of `y` and the number of rows in `X` must be consistent. The output shows `outliers_` is a boolean array of length 50. This suggests that `y` has 50 samples, and `X` has 50 rows.
    - The specific values of `X` and `y` influence the calculated `coef_`, `intercept_`, `scale_`, and `outliers_`. Since we are asked to predict the input, we can generate random data with the inferred shapes and hope that the optimization process leads to similar output values.
4. **sample_weight:** If not provided, it defaults to an array of ones with the same length as `y`. Since the output doesn't explicitly mention `sample_weight`, we can assume it's `None`.
