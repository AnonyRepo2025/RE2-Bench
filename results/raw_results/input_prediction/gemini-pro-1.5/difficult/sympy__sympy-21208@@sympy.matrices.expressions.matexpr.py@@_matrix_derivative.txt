[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the execution flow of `_matrix_derivative` to determine the required input.

1. **Output:** The output is a ZeroMatrix with shape (2, 2). This means the derivative calculation resulted in a zero matrix.

2. **_matrix_derivative function:**
   - It calculates the derivative of a matrix expression `expr` with respect to a variable `x`.
   - It uses `expr._eval_derivative_matrix_lines(x)` which in turn calls `_eval_derivative` and `applyfunc`.
   - `applyfunc` applies a function element-wise to the matrix. In this case, the function is `lambda x: x.diff(arg)`.
   - The final result is constructed using `Add.fromiter`.

3. **Zero Matrix Result:** To get a ZeroMatrix as a result, the derivative of each element of the input matrix `expr` with respect to `x` must be zero. This can happen if:
   - The input matrix `expr` is a constant matrix (i.e., contains only numbers).
   - The input matrix `expr` contains expressions that are independent of `x`.

4. **Input Matrix:** Since the output ZeroMatrix has shape (2, 2), the input matrix `expr` must also have shape (2, 2).  We can choose a simple constant matrix for `expr`, such as a matrix filled with zeros.

5. **Variable x:** The variable `x` can be any symbol. Let's choose `x` as the symbol.

Therefore, a possible input that produces the given output is a (2, 2) zero matrix and the symbol 'x'.
