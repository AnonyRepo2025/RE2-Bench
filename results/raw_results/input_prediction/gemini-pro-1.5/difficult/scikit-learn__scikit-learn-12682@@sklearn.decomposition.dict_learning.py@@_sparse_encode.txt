1. **Output Analysis:** The output `new_code` is a 2D numpy array of shape (3, 8) representing the sparse codes. The non-zero values suggest the contribution of corresponding dictionary atoms to reconstruct the input samples.

2. **Algorithm:** The output structure suggests the use of the 'omp' algorithm. This is further confirmed by the sparse nature of the output and the fact that other algorithms like 'lasso_lars' and 'threshold' would likely produce different output structures.

3. **Input X:** The shape of X is (3, n_features), where n_features is the number of features in the dictionary. Since the output code has 8 components (columns), the dictionary must have 8 features.  Therefore, X must also have 8 features. The specific values of X are difficult to determine precisely without knowing the dictionary and the exact calculations within the OMP algorithm. However, we can infer that X likely has values that lead to the specific sparse code generated. For simplicity, we can assume X to be a 3x8 array with some arbitrary values.

4. **Dictionary:** The dictionary is a matrix of shape (n_components, n_features).  The output code has 8 components (columns), so n_components = 8.  As determined earlier, n_features = 8.  Thus, the dictionary is an 8x8 matrix.  The exact values are unknown and would need to be reverse-engineered from the OMP algorithm, which is complex. We will use an identity matrix as a placeholder.

5. **Gram:** The Gram matrix is the dot product of the dictionary with its transpose (dictionary @ dictionary.T). Since we are using an 8x8 identity matrix as the dictionary, the Gram matrix will also be an 8x8 identity matrix.

6. **Regularization:** The `regularization` parameter in 'omp' controls the number of non-zero coefficients.  The output has one non-zero value per row.  Therefore, `regularization` is likely set to 1.

7. **Other parameters:**  We can set `cov` to `None` as it's optional for 'omp'. `copy_cov`, `init`, `max_iter`, `check_input`, `verbose`, and `positive` can be set to their default values or any values that don't cause errors.  We'll use the defaults for simplicity.
