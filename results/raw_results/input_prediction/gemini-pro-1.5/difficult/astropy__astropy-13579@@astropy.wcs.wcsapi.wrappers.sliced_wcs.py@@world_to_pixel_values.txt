1. **Output Analysis:** The output is a list containing two very small floating-point numbers, close to zero. This suggests that the input world coordinates are likely close to the reference pixel of the WCS.

2. **`world_to_pixel_values` Logic:** The function first calculates `sliced_out_world_coords` using `_pixel_to_world_values_all` with all zeros as input. This represents the world coordinates of the reference pixel after slicing.

3. **`_pixel_to_world_values_all` Logic:** This function takes pixel coordinates and applies the slicing defined by `_slices_pixel`.  It then calls the underlying WCS's `pixel_to_world_values` method.

4. **Simplification:** To simplify the problem, let's assume no slicing is applied. This means `_slices_pixel` will contain only `slice(None)` elements, and `_pixel_keep` and `_world_keep` will contain all indices.

5. **Input Deduction:** Since the output pixel coordinates are close to zero, and we're assuming no slicing, the input world coordinates should be close to the world coordinates of the reference pixel.  We can achieve this by setting the input world coordinates to the values in `sliced_out_world_coords`.  However, since we're aiming for a simple solution, we can just use `[0, 0]` as the input world coordinates, expecting the WCS to be close to a linear transformation around the reference pixel.  The small non-zero values in the output are likely due to floating-point inaccuracies or a slight non-linearity in the WCS.

6. **WCS Setup:** We need a 2D WCS (`naxis` and `_naxis` should be 2).  The other WCS parameters (`keysel`, `colsel`, `_pixel_bounds`) are not relevant for this specific case and can be set to reasonable defaults.
