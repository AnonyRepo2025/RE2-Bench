Let's consider some cases where the output is `False`.

Case 1: Unmatched brackets
Input: `(}`
- '(' is pushed onto the stack.
- '}' is encountered. The stack is popped, giving '('.
- The if condition `Current_Brkt == '('` is met.
- The nested if condition `Brkt != ')'` is met, so the function returns `False`.

Case 2: Extra closing bracket
Input: `())`
- '(' is pushed onto the stack.
- ')' is encountered. The stack is popped, giving '('.
- The if condition `Current_Brkt == '('` is met.
- The nested if condition `Brkt != ')'` is not met.
- ')' is encountered. The stack is empty, so `self.stack.pop()` raises an `IndexError`. However, the code doesn't handle this exception. Let's modify the input slightly.

Case 3: Extra opening bracket
Input: `(()`
- '(' is pushed onto the stack.
- '(' is pushed onto the stack.
- ')' is encountered. The stack is popped, giving '('.
- The if condition `Current_Brkt == '('` is met.
- The nested if condition `Brkt != ')'` is not met.
- The loop finishes. The stack is not empty, so the function returns `False`.

Case 4: Empty input
Input: ""
The loop doesn't execute. The stack is empty, so the function returns `True`.

Case 5: Input with non-bracket characters
Input: "(a)"
The `clear_expr` function removes all characters except brackets. The resulting expression is "()". The function returns `True`.

Let's choose Case 3 as it directly leads to the desired output without exceptions.
