[THOUGHT]
The output shows that `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` are all `null`. This happens when the `expr` in `PartialDerivative` has no free symbols, causing the function to return `S.Zero` early.  Therefore, we need an `expr` that evaluates to a number. The simplest example is a `Number` itself. Since `variables` doesn't affect this specific outcome, we can leave it empty.
