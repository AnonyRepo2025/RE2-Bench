Let's trace the execution of `replace_named_groups` to determine the input `pattern` that produces "admin/password_change/done/".

The function searches for named capture groups in the pattern using `named_group_matcher`.  It then iterates through these groups, finding the corresponding closing parenthesis.  Finally, it replaces the entire named group expression (e.g., `(?P<name>...)`) with just the group name (e.g., `<name>`).

Given the output "admin/password_change/done/", and considering the function's logic, the input `pattern` likely didn't contain any named capture groups. If it did, they would have been replaced by their names (enclosed in angle brackets). Since the output doesn't contain any angle brackets, it suggests the input string was simply "admin/password_change/done/" and no replacements occurred.
