1. The function `split_super_sub` splits the input `text` into a name, superscripts, and subscripts based on the provided delimiters.
2. The output shows the `name` as "alpha", `supers` as ["+"], and `subs` as ["1"].
3. Based on the code logic:
    - The name "alpha" is directly captured.
    - A superscript is indicated by "^".
    - A subscript preceded by a single "_" will be added normally.
    - A subscript preceded by double "__" will be added before all others.
    - A numerical suffix in the name will be treated as the first subscript.
4. Therefore, to obtain the given output, the input `text` must be "alpha^1+1". However, since "1" goes into `subscripts`, it belongs at the end of the term itself, specifically after a `_`. Due to the numerical index, it will come before the next subscript.
5. Putting it all together, we can form the input `text` as "alpha1^+".
