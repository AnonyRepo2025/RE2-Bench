Let's analyze the code step by step to determine the input that produces the given output.

The function `exptrigsimp(expr)` attempts to simplify expressions involving exponentials and trigonometric/hyperbolic functions.  The key transformations are:

1. **Rewriting in terms of exp/cos:** The input expression is rewritten in terms of exponentials and cosines, and the version with the fewest operations is chosen.
2. **Hyperbolic to trigonometric:** Hyperbolic functions are converted to trigonometric functions.
3. **Trigonometric simplification (TR2i):**  This function likely simplifies trigonometric expressions involving complex exponentials.
4. **Final check for introduced `I`:** If the simplified expression contains the imaginary unit `I` but the original expression didn't, the function returns the original expression.

The output is `1/(y*tanh(1))`. This suggests that the input expression likely involved hyperbolic functions, and the simplification process successfully expressed it in a more compact form using `tanh`.

Considering the transformations, a likely input is an expression that can be simplified to the given output.  Since the output involves `tanh(1)`, let's consider an expression involving `exp` and potentially some coefficients.

Recall the definition of `tanh(x)`:

```
tanh(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / (exp(x) + exp(-x))
```

If we substitute `x = 1`, we get:

```
tanh(1) = (exp(1) - exp(-1)) / (exp(1) + exp(-1)) = (E - 1/E) / (E + 1/E)
```

Therefore, an input of the form `1/(y*tanh(1))` itself should produce the same output, as it's already in simplified form.
