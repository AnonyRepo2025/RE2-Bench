[THOUGHT]
The output shows that the input expression `eq` is commutative because the second and third elements of the output tuple are `null`. This means the function didn't find any non-commutative parts in the expression. The first element of the output is the expression itself, which means no substitutions were made. Therefore, the input expression must be "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n" where all symbols are commutative.
