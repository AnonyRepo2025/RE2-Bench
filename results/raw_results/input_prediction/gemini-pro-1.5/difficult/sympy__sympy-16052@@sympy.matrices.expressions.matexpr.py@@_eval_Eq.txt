Let's analyze the code and the desired output to determine the input for `_eval_Eq`.

The function `_eval_Eq` returns `True` under the following conditions:

1. `other` is an instance of `MatrixExpr`.
2. `self.shape` is equal to `other.shape`.
3. `(self - other).is_ZeroMatrix` is `True`.

To satisfy these conditions and get the output `True`, we can consider the simplest case where `self` and `other` are identical zero matrices.

Let's choose `self` and `other` to be `ZeroMatrix(1, 1)`. This satisfies the first condition. The shape of a `ZeroMatrix(n, m)` is `(n, m)`, so `self.shape` and `other.shape` will both be `(1, 1)`, satisfying the second condition. Finally, subtracting a zero matrix from itself results in a zero matrix, so `(self - other)` will be a `ZeroMatrix`, and its `is_ZeroMatrix` attribute will be `True`, satisfying the third condition.
