Let's analyze the code and execution flow to determine the input.

The output is a `FiniteSet` containing the elements 10 and 15. This suggests that the `_complement` method computed a set difference or similar operation.

The relevant part of the `_complement` method is the handling of `FiniteSet` inputs:

```python
elif isinstance(other, FiniteSet):
    from sympy.utilities.iterables import sift

    def ternary_sift(el):
        contains = self.contains(el)
        return contains if contains in [True, False] else None
    sifted = sift(other, ternary_sift)
    return Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet)
```

This code sifts the elements of `other` (which is a `FiniteSet`) based on whether `self` contains them.  The result is a union of two sets:

1. `FiniteSet(*sifted[False])`: Elements of `other` that are *not* in `self`.
2. `Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False)`:  A complement operation involving elements whose containment in `self` could not be definitively determined (returned `None` from `ternary_sift`).

Since our output is simply `{10, 15}`, it means the second part of the union resulted in an empty set. This implies that `self.contains(el)` returned either `True` or `False` for all elements in `other`.

To get the output `{10, 15}`, all elements of `other` must *not* be present in `self`.  Therefore, `sifted[False]` must be `[10, 15]`.

Let's assume `self` is the empty set. Then, `self.contains(el)` would return `False` for any `el`.  This would lead to `sifted[False]` containing all elements of `other`, and the output would be equal to `other`.

Therefore, if `other` is `FiniteSet(10, 15)` and `self` is the empty set, the output would be `FiniteSet(10, 15)`.
