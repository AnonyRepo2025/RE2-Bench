1. The output regex "^(?P\"<lang>\"[^/]+)\\/(?P\"<url>\".+)\\/$" suggests the input route contains two named parameters: "lang" and "url".
2. The regex for "lang" is "[^/]+", which matches one or more characters that are not a forward slash. This corresponds to the default "str" converter, but with a custom regex.
3. The regex for "url" is ".+", which matches one or more of any character. This also corresponds to the default "str" converter, but with a custom regex.
4. The trailing '$' in the regex indicates that is_endpoint is True.

Based on these observations, the input route should be "<lang:slug>/<url:path>/", where "slug" and "path" are custom converters with regexes "[^/]+" and ".+" respectively.
