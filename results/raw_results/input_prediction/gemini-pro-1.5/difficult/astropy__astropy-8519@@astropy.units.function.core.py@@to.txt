Let's analyze the code and determine the conditions that lead to the output 100.0.

The function `to` has several branches:

1. **`if other is self.physical_unit:`**: If this condition is met, the function returns `self.to_physical(value)`. We want the output to be 100.0, so we need `self.to_physical(value)` to return 100.0.  Let's assume `self.physical_unit` is `dimensionless_unscaled` and `self.function_unit` is also `dimensionless_unscaled`. In this case, `to_physical` would simply return the input `value`.  So, we can set `value` to 100.0 and `other` equal to `self.physical_unit`.

2. **`if self.function_unit.is_equivalent(other_function_unit):`**: If the function units are equivalent, the code performs some conversions based on the physical units.  We can avoid this branch by making the physical units the same as in the previous case.

3. **`else`**: This branch attempts to convert the physical units directly.  We want to avoid this branch to keep things simple.

Based on this analysis, we can construct the following input:

* `self.physical_unit`: `dimensionless_unscaled`
* `self.function_unit`: `dimensionless_unscaled`
* `other`: `dimensionless_unscaled`
* `value`: 100.0
* `equivalencies`: [] (empty list)

This input will satisfy the first condition (`other is self.physical_unit`) and return `self.to_physical(value)`, which will be 100.0.
