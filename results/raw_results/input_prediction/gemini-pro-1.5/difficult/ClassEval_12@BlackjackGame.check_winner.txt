The `check_winner` function compares the values of player's and dealer's hands in a Blackjack game. The output "Player wins" occurs in the following scenarios:

1. Both player and dealer bust (go over 21), but the player's value is less than or equal to the dealer's value.
2. The dealer busts, but the player does not.
3. Neither player nor dealer busts, and the player's value is greater than the dealer's value.

Let's consider a few examples for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Player hand: ['10H', '9H', '3H'] (22)
Dealer hand: ['10S', '9S', '5S'] (24)

Scenario 2:
Player hand: ['10H', '9H'] (19)
Dealer hand: ['10S', '9S', '3S'] (22)

Scenario 3:
Player hand: ['10H', '9H'] (19)
Dealer hand: ['10S', '8S'] (18)


Let's choose Scenario 3 for simplicity.
