The output shows only `__wrapped__` attribute of the returned `manager_method`. This attribute is added by the `@wraps(method)` decorator. The decorator copies attributes from the original `method` to the wrapper function `manager_method`. Since the output shows an empty dictionary for `__wrapped__`, it means the input `method` was likely an empty function or a function without any custom attributes. The name of the method doesn't affect the output in this case.
