[THOUGHT]
The function `_osborne` replaces hyperbolic functions with trigonometric functions, multiplying the argument by `d`.

The output is `2*I*sin(2*_Dummy_588)`. This suggests the original expression contained `sinh`. The argument of `sin` is `2*_Dummy_588`, which means the original argument of `sinh` was multiplied by `d=2`.

Therefore, the input expression `e` should be `2*sinh(x)`, where `x` is a symbol. Since a dummy symbol `_Dummy_588` is used in the output, the input symbol is also likely a dummy symbol.  Let's assume the input is `2*sinh(_Dummy_588)`.

Let's trace the execution:

1. **Input:** `e = 2*sinh(_Dummy_588)`, `d = 2`
2. **bottom_up:** The `bottom_up` function traverses the expression tree.
3. **f(rv):** The inner function `f` is called with `rv = sinh(_Dummy_588)`.
4. **Inside f:**
   - `a = _Dummy_588`
   - `a = a * d = _Dummy_588 * 2 = 2*_Dummy_588`
   - `return I * sin(a) = I * sin(2*_Dummy_588)`
5. **bottom_up continues:** The `sinh` is replaced with `I * sin(2*_Dummy_588)`. The expression becomes `2 * (I * sin(2*_Dummy_588)) = 2*I*sin(2*_Dummy_588)`.

This matches the output.
