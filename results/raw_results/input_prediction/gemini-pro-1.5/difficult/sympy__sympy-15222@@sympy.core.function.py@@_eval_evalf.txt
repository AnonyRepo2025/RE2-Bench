Let's trace the execution to determine the input.

1. **Output:** The output is "0.e+0", which is mpmath's representation of 0.0.

2. **`_eval_evalf` function:** This function attempts to evaluate the given expression to a floating-point number using `mpmath`.

3. **`self.func`:** The function first tries to get the name of the function being called (e.g., 'sin', 'cos', etc.).  If `self` represents an addition, then `self.func` will be `sympy.core.add.Add`.

4. **`getattr(mpmath, fname)`:** The code then tries to find a corresponding function in `mpmath`. If it fails (as it would for `Add`), it falls back to `self._imp_`, which is not provided, and then attempts to call `evalf` on each argument and then apply the function. If this also fails, it returns `None`.

5. **`_to_mpmath`:** Inside `evalf`, the arguments are converted to `mpmath` numbers using `_to_mpmath`.

6. **`evalf_add`:** Since our function is `Add`, `evalf` will call `evalf_add`. This function recursively calls `evalf` on each argument of the addition.

7. **Reaching Zero:** To get the final output of 0.0, the simplest input would be an `Add` object where all arguments evaluate to 0.0.  Let's use a single argument, 0, for simplicity. The `prec` argument doesn't affect the outcome in this case since the input is already exactly zero.

Therefore, a simple input that produces the given output is an `Add` object with a single argument 0 and an arbitrary precision.

[THOUGHT]
The output is 0.0. The simplest way to achieve this is with an Add instance whose argument is 0.  The precision doesn't matter in this case.
