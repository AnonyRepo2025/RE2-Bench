[THOUGHT]
The output shows that `estimators_` and `named_estimators_` are empty. This happens when the input `self.estimators` is empty or contains only `None` or 'drop'. Also, the output `estimators`, `weights`, and `n_jobs` are `null`, indicating they were not modified during the function execution. Therefore, they were likely `None` in the input as well.  Let's set `X` and `y` to simple values that will pass the validation checks but won't cause any estimators to be fitted.
