Let's analyze the provided code and output to determine the input of the `fit` function.

The `fit` function calculates optimal change points in a dataset using Bayesian Blocks. The output is an array of change points.  The key parameters that influence the result are `t` (the input time array), `x` (the input data values), `sigma` (the uncertainties associated with `x`), `p0` (false positive probability), `gamma` (prior on the number of change points), and `ncp_prior`.

The output change points are: `[ 4.36037718 48.45689469 52.59791734 99.45505108]`.  This suggests that the input `t` array spans at least up to ~100. The specific locations of the change points depend on the distribution of `x` values and their uncertainties (`sigma`).

Without knowing the specific `x` and `sigma` values, it's impossible to precisely reconstruct the input. However, we can create a plausible input scenario that would produce similar change points.  Let's assume a simple case where `x` has two distinct levels with some noise, and the change points correspond to transitions between these levels.
