Let's analyze the code and its behavior to determine the input that produces the given output.

The `_eval_subs` function attempts to substitute an expression (`old`) with another expression (`new`) within the given `self` object.  In this case, `self` represents a function application (an instance of the `Application` class).

The crucial part is the following block within `_eval_subs`:

```python
if old.is_Function and new.is_Function and callable(old) and callable(new) and (old == self.func) and (len(self.args) in new.nargs):
    return new(*[i._subs(old, new) for i in self.args])
```

This condition checks if `old` and `new` are functions, callable, and if `old` is the same as the function being called in `self`.  It also checks if the number of arguments in `self` is compatible with the `nargs` of `new`. If all these conditions are met, it applies the `new` function to the arguments of `self` after recursively substituting `old` with `new` in each argument.

Given the output "2*x", we can deduce the following:

1. `self` must represent a function application where the function is the same as `old`.
2. `new` must be a function that, when applied to the (potentially substituted) arguments of `self`, results in "2*x".
3. The number of arguments in `self` must be within the allowed number of arguments specified by `new.nargs`.

Let's assume `self` represents the application `f(y)`, where `f` is the same as `old`, and `y` is some expression.  Let's also assume `new` is a function `g`.  Then, the substitution would result in `g(y._subs(f, g))`.  For this to result in "2*x", a likely scenario is that `y` is `2*x`, `f` is a dummy function, and `g` is an identity function (or a function that doesn't modify its argument when the argument doesn't contain `f`).

Therefore, we can construct the input as follows:

* `old`: A dummy function `f`.  We'll use a dummy module and docstring.  `_nargs` can be any valid value (e.g., 1).
* `new`: A function `g` such that `g(2*x) = 2*x`.  We'll set `nargs` to include 1.
* `self`: An application of `f` with the argument `2*x`.  Since we're focusing on `_eval_subs`, the `nargs` of `self` doesn't directly influence the output in this specific scenario.
