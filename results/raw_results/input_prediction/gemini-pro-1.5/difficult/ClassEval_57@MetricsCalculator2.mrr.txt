The output is a list containing the mean MRR (0.25) and a list of individual MRRs ([0.25]). This suggests the input `data` is a tuple, as a list input would produce a list of MRRs with length > 1 in the output.

The MRR is calculated as the reciprocal of the rank of the first relevant item. An MRR of 0.25 means the first relevant item is at rank 4 (1/4 = 0.25).

Therefore, the input `data` must be a tuple where the first element is a list representing relevance scores, and the second element is the total number of items. The list should have a 1 at index 3 (representing rank 4) and 0s elsewhere. The total number of items doesn't affect the calculation as long as it's not zero.
