Let's analyze the code and its behavior to determine the input that produces the given output.

The `factor_terms` function attempts to factor out common terms from an expression. In the given output, "R3 + R4 + 4050", no factoring has occurred. This suggests that the input expression likely contains terms that cannot be further factored.

The function `gcd_terms` is called within `factor_terms`. If the input expression is a sum, `gcd_terms` tries to find the greatest common divisor of the terms. Since no factoring happened, the GCD is likely 1.

The output "R3 + R4 + 4050" indicates that the input expression was a sum of three terms: R3, R4, and 4050.  Since the output is identical to a potential input (besides sympification), we can assume the simplest input that would produce this output.

Therefore, the input `expr` should be "R3 + R4 + 4050".
