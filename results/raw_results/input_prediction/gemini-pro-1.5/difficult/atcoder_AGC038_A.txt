```python
import sys

def solve(H: int, W: int, A: int, B: int):
    answer = [['0'] * W for _ in range(H)]
    for i in range(H):
        for j in range(W):
            if i < B:
                if j < A:
                    answer[i][j] = '0'
                else:
                    answer[i][j] = '1'
            elif j < A:
                answer[i][j] = '1'
            else:
                answer[i][j] = '0'
    for i in range(H):
        print(''.join(answer[i]))
    return

```
The output consists of 1000 lines, each with 1000 characters of '0' or '1'. The input must be four integers: H, W, A, and B.
The output is a HxW grid.
The top B rows have A '0's followed by (W-A) '1's.
The bottom (H-B) rows have A '1's followed by (W-A) '0's.

Since the output is all '1's, we must have A = 0 or W-A = W, which means A=0. Similarly, we must have B=0 or H-B = 0, which means B=H.
Since the output is a 1000x1000 grid of '1's, H = 1000 and W = 1000.
If B=H, then the first loop `i < B` is always false, so the `elif j < A` condition is checked. Since the output is all '1's, A must be 0.
Therefore, the input must be H=1000, W=1000, A=0, B=1000.
