The output suggests a linear diophantine equation solution. The presence of `t_0` indicates the use of a parameter. The output `[3*t_0 - 5, 2*t_0 - 5]` implies the solutions are expressed in terms of this parameter.

A linear diophantine equation has the general form ax + by = c. The solution to this equation can be expressed as x = x_0 + bt and y = y_0 - at, where (x_0, y_0) is a particular solution and t is an integer parameter.

Comparing the output with the general form, we can deduce:

* x = 3t - 5
* y = 2t - 5

This suggests that the original equation might be of the form ax + by = c, where the coefficients of x and y are related to the coefficients of t in the solution.

Let's assume the equation is 2x - 3y = c.
A particular solution can be obtained by setting t = 0:
x = -5
y = -5

Substituting these values into the assumed equation:
2*(-5) - 3*(-5) = -10 + 15 = 5

So, the equation 2x - 3y = 5 has the solutions x = 3t - 5 and y = 2t - 5.

Therefore, the input equation should be 2x - 3y - 5 = 0.
