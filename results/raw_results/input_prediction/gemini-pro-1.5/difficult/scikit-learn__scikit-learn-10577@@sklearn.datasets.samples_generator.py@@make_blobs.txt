1. **n_samples**: The output shows 8 samples generated. Thus, n_samples = 8.
2. **centers**: The output has two distinct clusters. One cluster centers around [1.5, 4.5] and the other around [2, 1].  So, centers should be a 2x2 array (or a list of lists) representing these two centers.
3. **random_state**: The exact values in the output depend on the random state. Since we are trying to reproduce the output, we need to find a random state that generates these specific values.  However, without more information or trial and error, it's difficult to determine the exact random state used.  For simplicity, we can set random_state to None or any integer value.  This might not reproduce the exact output, but it will generate blobs with similar characteristics.
