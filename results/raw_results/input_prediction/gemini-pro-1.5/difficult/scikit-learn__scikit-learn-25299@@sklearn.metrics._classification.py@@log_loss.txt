Let's analyze the `log_loss` function and determine the inputs `y_true`, `y_pred`, and `eps` that produce the given output.

The `log_loss` function calculates the cross-entropy loss between `y_true` (true labels) and `y_pred` (predicted probabilities). The formula for log loss is essentially:

```
loss = -sum(y_true * log(y_pred))
```

We are given that the output is approximately 0. To achieve this, `y_true` and `y_pred` should align perfectly.  Let's consider a simple case with two classes:

* **y_true:** [0, 1]
* **y_pred:** [0, 1]

In this scenario, the log loss would be:

```
loss = -(0 * log(0) + 1 * log(1)) 
```

Since `log(1)` is 0, the loss becomes 0. However, `log(0)` is undefined. The function handles this by clipping `y_pred` values to be within `[eps, 1-eps]`.  If `eps` is 'auto', it defaults to `np.finfo(y_pred.dtype).eps`.

Let's assume `y_pred.dtype` is `float64`. Then `eps` will be a very small value.  If `y_pred` is [0, 1], it will be clipped to `[eps, 1-eps]`.  The log loss will then be close to zero, but not exactly zero due to the clipping.

To get a value very close to zero (2.2204460492503136e-16), we can set `y_true` and `y_pred` to be identical and contain values close to 0 or 1.

Let's choose:

* `y_true = [0, 1]`
* `y_pred = [0, 1]`
* `eps = 'auto'`

This should result in a log loss very close to 0 due to the clipping.
