1. **Output Analysis:** The output is a tuple: `(num, units, calendar)`.
   - `num`: 10 (integer, representing the time difference from the reference date)
   - `units`: "days since 2000-01-01"
   - `calendar`: "gregorian"

2. **Input `calendar`:** Since the output `calendar` is "gregorian", the input `calendar` must be either None or "gregorian" (case-insensitive).  Let's assume it's None for now, as that's the most common scenario.

3. **Input `units`:**  The output `units` is "days since 2000-01-01". This means the input `units` could be None, or it could be this exact string, or some variant that gets cleaned up to this string. Let's assume it's None, which will cause the function to infer the units.

4. **Input `dates`:** This is the trickiest part. We need a date that is 10 days after 2000-01-01, using the Gregorian calendar.  That date is 2000-01-11. Since the code handles both NumPy `datetime64` and `cftime` objects, we can provide the input as either. Let's use a NumPy `datetime64` object for simplicity.

5. **Data Type:** The `num` output is an integer. This means the time difference between the input date and the reference date must be exactly a multiple of the time delta specified in the units.  If we use `np.datetime64`, this condition will be met.
