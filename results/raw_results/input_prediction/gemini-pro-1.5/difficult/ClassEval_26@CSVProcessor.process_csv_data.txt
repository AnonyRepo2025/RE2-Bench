Let's analyze the code and determine the input based on the output 1.

The `process_csv_data` function reads a CSV file, extracts the N-th column, converts the elements to uppercase, and writes the modified data (title and the uppercase column) to a new CSV file. The function returns 1 if the writing is successful and 0 otherwise. Since the output is 1, the CSV writing operation was successful.

Let's create a sample CSV file named 'test.csv':

```
Name,Age,City
Alice,25,New York
Bob,30,London
Charlie,28,Paris
```

If we set N = 2 and save_file_name = 'test.csv', the function will extract the 'City' column, convert it to uppercase, and write it to 'test_process.csv'.

The 'test_process.csv' file will contain:

```
Name,Age,City
NEW YORK
LONDON
PARIS
```

Since the writing was successful, the function returns 1.
