Let's analyze the `urlencode` function and how it produces the output "a=1&b=2&c=3".

The function iterates through the input `query`, which can be a dictionary-like object or a list of tuples.  For each key-value pair, it URL-encodes the key and value and joins them with an equals sign. Multiple key-value pairs are joined with ampersands.

In our case, the output is "a=1&b=2&c=3". This suggests the input `query` should be something like:

- A dictionary: `{'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3'}`
- A list of tuples: `[('a', '1'), ('b', '2'), ('c', '3')]`
- A MultiValueDict: Since the function handles MultiValueDict specifically by calling .lists(), which returns an iterator of items, a MultiValueDict with the above key-value pairs would also work.

Since the structure only allows for a single `query` argument, and the simplest form matching the output is a dictionary, we'll use that.
