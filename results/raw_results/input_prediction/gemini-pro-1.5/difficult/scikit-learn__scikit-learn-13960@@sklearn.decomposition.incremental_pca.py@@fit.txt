1. **n_components, whiten, copy, batch_size:** These are directly reflected in the output, so we can fill these in directly: `n_components` is null, `whiten` is false, `copy` is true, `batch_size` is "38".

2. **X:** This is the input data. We know the following about the output:
    - `n_samples_seen_` is 100, meaning X has 100 samples.
    - `n_components_` is 3, meaning the number of features is >= 3 (since `n_components_` is the minimum of n_samples in the first batch and n_features if `n_components` is None).
    - `mean_` is a 3-element array, indicating X has 3 features.
    - `var_` is a 3-element array, confirming X has 3 features.
    - The output `components_`, `singular_values_`, `explained_variance_`, `explained_variance_ratio_` are all related to the singular value decomposition of the centered data matrix X.  We can't directly reconstruct X from these values.

Since we can't determine the exact values of X, we need to create a dataset X with 100 samples and 3 features that, when fit with the given parameters, *could* produce the output observed.  We can't guarantee it will produce the *exact* output due to the non-deterministic nature of SVD, but we can create a plausible input.  A simple approach is to generate random data:

```python
import numpy as np
X = np.random.rand(100, 3)
```

This creates a 100x3 matrix with random values between 0 and 1.  This is a plausible input, although it won't necessarily produce the exact output shown.
