The output is pi, which means the difference of squares of the radii is 1.
Since the `radius` attribute of the class is not used in the `calculate_annulus_area` method, it can be any value.
We can choose `inner_radius` to be 0 and `outer_radius` to be 1.
Then, the area will be pi * (1^2 - 0^2) = pi.
