Let's analyze the execution flow for the function `f` to determine the inputs `full` and `part` that result in the output `2`.

The function counts the non-overlapping occurrences of `part` within `full`.

The `while` loop continues as long as `index` is not -1.  The loop increments `count` in each iteration. Since the final output is 2, the loop must execute twice.

Let's trace a possible execution:

1. **First iteration:**
   - `index = full.find(part)` returns a non-negative value.
   - `count` becomes 1.
   - `full` is updated by slicing from `index + length` onwards.

2. **Second iteration:**
   - `index = full.find(part)` returns a non-negative value.
   - `count` becomes 2.
   - `full` is updated again.

3. **Third iteration (doesn't happen):**
   - `index = full.find(part)` returns -1.
   - The loop terminates.

A simple example that satisfies this is:

- `full = "abab"`
- `part = "ab"`

Let's trace this:

1. `length = len("ab") = 2`
2. `index = "abab".find("ab") = 0`
3. `count = 1`
4. `full = "abab"[0 + 2:] = "ab"`
5. `index = "ab".find("ab") = 0`
6. `count = 2`
7. `full = "ab"[0 + 2:] = ""`
8. `index = "".find("ab") = -1`

Therefore, `full = "abab"` and `part = "ab"` produce the output `2`.
