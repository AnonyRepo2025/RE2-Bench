Since the output is `null`, and the function `__delitem__` deletes an item from the `_data` dictionary, the input `key` can be any value that is not initially present in the `_data` dictionary.  Since `_data` is initialized as empty, any value for `key` will result in the same output.  We can choose a simple string like "test_key".
