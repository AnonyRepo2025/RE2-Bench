The function `f` first applies the `title()` method to the input string and then removes all spaces. The `title()` method capitalizes the first letter of each word and converts the rest to lowercase.  The output is "1Oe-ErrBzz-Bmm".

Since all spaces are removed, we can look for capitalized letters to determine word boundaries. These are 'O', 'E', 'B'. So the words were "1o", "e", "err", "bzz", "bmm".

Therefore, the original string must have been "1o e err bzz bmm".
