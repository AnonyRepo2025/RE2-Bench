The function `f` searches for the `target` within the `items` list. If found, it returns the index of the `target`. Otherwise, it returns -1.

The output is 3, which means the `target` was found at index 3 in `items`.  Therefore, `items[3]` must be equal to `target`.  We can construct an example where this is true.
