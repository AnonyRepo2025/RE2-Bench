Let's analyze the function `f(num, l)` and its behavior based on the provided output.

The function aims to pad the input string `num` with leading zeros until its length becomes equal to `l`. The output is "001".

This tells us that the final length of the string is 3 (because "001" has 3 characters).  The original string `num` is "1". Therefore, two zeros were added.

So, `l` must have been 3, and `num` must have been "1".
