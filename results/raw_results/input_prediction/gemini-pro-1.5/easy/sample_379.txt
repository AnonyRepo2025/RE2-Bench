The output is `False`, which means the function encountered a 0 at some index `i` which is a multiple of 3 from the end of the list. The list is then cleared.

Let's consider the simplest case: `nums = [0]`.
`len(nums) = 1`.
The loop starts at `i = 0`.
`nums[0] == 0` is true, so the list is cleared and `False` is returned.

Let's consider another case: `nums = [1, 2, 0]`.
`len(nums) = 3`.
The loop starts at `i = 2`.
`nums[2] == 0` is true, so the list is cleared and `False` is returned.

Let's consider another case: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0]`.
`len(nums) = 6`.
The loop starts at `i = 5`.
`nums[5] == 0` is true, so the list is cleared and `False` is returned.
