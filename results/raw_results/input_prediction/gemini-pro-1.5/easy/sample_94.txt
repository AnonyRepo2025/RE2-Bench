The function `f(a, b)` merges two dictionaries `a` and `b`. The output is `{"w": 3, "wi": 10}`.

The structure of the input is given as:

```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "a": {
            "w": XXX,
            "wi": XXX
        },
        "b": {
            "w": XXX
        }
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```

The function `f` uses the dictionary unpacking operator `**` to merge the two dictionaries. If there are duplicate keys, the value from the later dictionary overwrites the value from the earlier dictionary.

In this case, the output contains two keys: "w" and "wi". The final value of "w" is 3. Since "b" is the later dictionary and it contains "w", the value of "w" in "b" must be 3.

The final value of "wi" is 10. Since "b" doesn't contain "wi", the value of "wi" in "a" must be 10. The value of "w" in "a" can be anything, as it will be overwritten by the value of "w" in "b". Let's assume it's 0.
