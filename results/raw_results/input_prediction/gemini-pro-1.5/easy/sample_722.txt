The function `f` iterates through the input string `text` and converts uppercase characters to lowercase and lowercase characters to uppercase. The output is ",WpZpPPDL/". To find the input, we can reverse this process:

- ',' becomes ',' (no change for special characters)
- 'W' becomes 'w'
- 'p' becomes 'P'
- 'Z' becomes 'z'
- 'p' becomes 'P'
- 'P' becomes 'p'
- 'P' becomes 'p'
- 'D' becomes 'd'
- 'L' becomes 'l'
- '/' becomes '/' (no change for special characters)

Therefore, the input string is ",wPzPpPdLl/".
