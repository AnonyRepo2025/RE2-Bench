The `list_employees` method iterates through the `self.employees` dictionary and constructs a new dictionary with employee details. The output shows that there's one employee with ID "1".  The inner loop adds the employee ID to the details. Therefore, the input `self.employees` dictionary must have the same structure as the output, except without the redundant "employee_ID" field within each employee's data.
