The output is an empty string. This means the `while` loop continued until the entire `string` was consumed by removing the `substring` from the beginning.

Therefore, the `string` must have been made up entirely of the `substring` repeated multiple times.

For example:
- string = "ab", substring = "ab" -> ""
- string = "abab", substring = "ab" -> ""
- string = "ababab", substring = "ab" -> ""
- string = "abababc", substring = "ab" -> "c"

We can choose any string and substring that satisfy this condition. Let's choose "abab" and "ab".
