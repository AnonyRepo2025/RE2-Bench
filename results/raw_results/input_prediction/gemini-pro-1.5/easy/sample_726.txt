The function `f` counts the number of whitespace characters and the total number of characters in the input string `text`.

The output is a list containing two elements:
1. The number of whitespace characters (ws): 2
2. The total number of characters (len(text)): 34

Therefore, the input string `text` must have 34 characters, 2 of which are whitespace characters.  The other 32 characters can be anything (except whitespace).  One such example is a string with 32 'a's and 2 spaces.
