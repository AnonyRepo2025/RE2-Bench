Let the input be "X Y".
X and Y are split and stored in a and b respectively.
The second character of b is removed.
a and b are converted to integers.
The output is a * b // 100.
The output is 0.

Since the final result is an integer division by 100 resulting in 0, the product a * b must be less than 100.

Let's consider some cases:
1. a = 1, b = 99. Input: "1 9X9", where X can be any digit.
2. a = 2, b = 49. Input: "2 4X9", where X can be any digit.
3. a = 99, b = 1. Input: "99 1X", where X can be any digit.

Let's choose the simplest case: a = 1, b = 99. A possible input is "1 909".
