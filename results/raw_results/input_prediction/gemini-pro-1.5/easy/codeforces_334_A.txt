The code takes an integer n as input. It initializes two variables i and j to 1 and n*n respectively. The code then enters a while loop that continues as long as i is less than j. Inside the loop, it prints the values of i and j, increments i by 1, and decrements j by 1.

From the output, we can see that the largest value of j is 100. This implies that n*n = 100. Therefore, n = 10.
