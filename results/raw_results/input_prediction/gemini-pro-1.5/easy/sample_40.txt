The function `f` takes a string `text` and adds `#` characters to the right until the length of the string is one greater than the original length of `text`.

The output is `"the cow goes moo#"`. The length of the output is 16. Therefore, the length of the input `text` must be 15. The output is the input string left-justified and padded with `#` to a length of 16.

Therefore, the input must be `"the cow goes moo"`.
