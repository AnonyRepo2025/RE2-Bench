Let's analyze the output and connect it to the input arguments of `_parallel_fit_estimator`, focusing on the `estimator.fit` call within.

1. **Solver and Multi-class:** The output shows `solver": "warn"` and `"multi_class": "warn"`.  This indicates the default behavior of LogisticRegression was used.

2. **C, penalty, dual, tol, fit_intercept, intercept_scaling, class_weight, random_state, max_iter, verbose, warm_start, n_jobs, l1_ratio:** These parameters in the output directly correspond to the input parameters of the LogisticRegression estimator.  We can directly use the output values as the input values.

3. **classes_, coef_, intercept_, n_iter_:** These are attributes set *after* the `fit` method is called. They are the results of the fitting process, not inputs.

4. **X and y:** The output `coef_` has a shape (3, 2), meaning there are 3 classes and 2 features.  The `intercept_` has shape (3,), confirming 3 classes.  Therefore, `X` must have shape (n_samples, 2) and `y` must have 3 unique classes.  To keep it simple, let's assume `n_samples` is 10.  We'll create dummy data for `X` and `y` that satisfy these constraints.

5. **sample_weight:** The output doesn't explicitly indicate whether sample weights were used. Since it's not mentioned and the default is `None`, we'll set `sample_weight` to `None`.

Based on this reasoning, we can construct the input.
