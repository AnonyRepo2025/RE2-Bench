[THOUGHT]
The function returns "error" if either of these conditions is met:
1. `i.index('.') == len(i) - 1`  (i ends with a dot)
2. `i.index('.') == 0` (i starts with a dot)

The loop iterates through the space-separated words in `items`. So, to get "error", we need `items` to contain a word that either starts or ends with a dot. `target` can be anything, as it doesn't affect the output in this case.
