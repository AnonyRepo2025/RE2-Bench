The output is "x0x0", which is "x0" repeated twice. The function repeats "x0" n times, where n is the index of the first occurrence of '8' in the input string. Since the output is "x0" repeated twice, n must be 2. Therefore, the first occurrence of '8' in the input string must be at index 2. An example of such a string is "xx8".
