Let's analyze the function `f(text)` and its behavior to determine the input that produces the given output.

The function iterates through the words in the input `text` and removes any occurrences of `-word` or `{}-word`.

The output is `"stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-."`.  Notice the following:

* **"stew---"**: This suggests that "stew" was not a word in the original input string that was split by spaces. If it were, the leading hyphens would have been removed.
* **"corn-and-beans-in"**: This part appears unchanged, suggesting these words were not present individually in the original input.
* **"soup-."**: Similar to "stew", "soup" likely wasn't a standalone word initially, and the trailing hyphen would have been removed otherwise.

Based on these observations, we can reconstruct a possible input by inserting spaces where the replacements occurred:

1. **stew---**:  The hyphens likely resulted from removing other words. Let's assume there was a word `X` before stew. The original could have been `X-stew---`. The function would have removed `-X`, leaving `stew---`.

2. **corn-and-beans-in**: This part likely remained unchanged.

3. **soup-.**: Similar to "stew", let's assume there was a word `Y` before soup. The original could have been `Y-soup-.`. The function would have removed `-Y`, leaving `soup-.`.

Combining these, a possible input is `X-stew---corn-and-beans-in Y-soup-.`.  Since `X` and `Y` could be anything, let's use a placeholder like "removed" for them:

`removed-stew---corn-and-beans-in removed-soup-.`

Let's test this input:

1. Splitting the input by spaces gives: `['removed-stew---corn-and-beans-in', 'removed-soup-.']`
2. First iteration (item = 'removed-stew---corn-and-beans-in'):
   - `text.replace('-removed-stew---corn-and-beans-in', ' ')`: No change.
   - `text.replace('{}-removed-stew---corn-and-beans-in', ' ')`: No change.
3. Second iteration (item = 'removed-soup-.'):
   - `text.replace('-removed-soup-.', ' ')`: No change.
   - `text.replace('{}-removed-soup-.', ' ')`: No change.
4. `text.strip('-')`: Removes leading/trailing hyphens if any.

The output would be `stew---corn-and-beans-in soup-.`, which matches the expected output.
