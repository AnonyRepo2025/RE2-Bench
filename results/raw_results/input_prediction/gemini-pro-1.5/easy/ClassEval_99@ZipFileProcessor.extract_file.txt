The `extract_file` function attempts to extract a specified file from a zip archive. The output `True` indicates that the extraction was successful.  This means the provided zip file exists and contains the file to be extracted.  Let's assume the zip file is named "test.zip" and contains a file named "test.txt". We'll also assume the output path is "." (current directory).
