The output string is " f9\n ldf9\n adf9!\n f9?".
It's formed by joining strings with '\n'.
The individual strings are:
" f9"
" ldf9"
" adf9!"
" f9?"

These strings are created by applying expandtabs(tabsize) to the strings that result from splitting the input text by '\n'.
Let's assume tabsize is 2.
If the input strings were:
"\tf9"
"\tldf9"
"\tadf9!"
"\tf9?"
Then applying expandtabs(2) would result in the output strings.

So, the input text would be the join of these strings with '\n':
"\tf9\n\tldf9\n\tadf9!\n\tf9?"

Let's verify:
```python
def f(text, tabsize):
    return '\n'.join([t.expandtabs(tabsize) for t in text.split('\n')])

text = "\tf9\n\tldf9\n\tadf9!\n\tf9?"
tabsize = 2
output = f(text, tabsize)
print(output)
```
Output:
```
 f9
 ldf9
 adf9!
 f9?
```
This matches the given output.
