The function `f` returns the highest index in the string `text` where the character `char` is found. The output is 2. This means the last occurrence of `char` in `text` is at index 2.

One possible input is `text = "abca"` and `char = "c"`.
Another possible input is `text = "xyczz"` and `char = "c"`.
