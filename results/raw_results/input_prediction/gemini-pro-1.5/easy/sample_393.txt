Let's reverse engineer the function `f(text)` given the output "a---c---s".

The function reverses the input string `text`, then iterates through it in chunks of 3 characters from right to left (original string's left to right), joining each chunk with "---".

The output "a---c---s" suggests the reversed string `ls` had chunks "a", "c", and "s".  Since the loop processes chunks of 3, and the output has single characters, the original string likely had single characters.

The loop adds "---" after each chunk. The final "---" is removed.  So, the reversed string `ls` was likely "sca".

Therefore, the original input string `text` must have been "acs".
