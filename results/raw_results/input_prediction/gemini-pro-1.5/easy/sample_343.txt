The `extend` method adds all elements of an iterable to the end of a list.  The output is `[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]`. Let's analyze how this output could have been produced.

The `elem` argument must be an iterable. If `elem` was a single element, it would have been added as a single element. However, we see nested lists in the output, suggesting that `elem` itself was a list.

Let's assume `array` was initially `[[1, 2, 3]]`. If `elem` was `[[1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]`, then `array.extend(elem)` would produce the observed output.

Therefore, the input `array` is `[[1, 2, 3]]` and `elem` is `[[1, 2], 1, [1, 2, 3], 3, [2, 1]]`.
