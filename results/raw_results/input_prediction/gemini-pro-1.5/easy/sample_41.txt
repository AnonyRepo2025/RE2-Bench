Let's trace the execution backward.

The final output is `[58, 92, 21]`. This is after a final `array.reverse()`. So before the reversal, the array must have been `[21, 92, 58]`.

Now, let's consider the loop. The values are inserted in the middle of the array.

If `values = [92]`, and the initial `array` was `[21, 58]`, let's trace the execution:

1. `array.reverse()`: `array` becomes `[58, 21]`
2. Loop: `array.insert(len(array) // 2, 92)`: `array` becomes `[58, 92, 21]`
3. `array.reverse()`: `array` becomes `[21, 92, 58]`

This matches the output.

Therefore, `array = [21, 58]` and `values = [92]`.
