Let's consider different scenarios for the input `data` to the `median` function, aiming for an output of 5.

* **Scenario 1: Single element list**
If `data` is `[5]`, the sorted list is `[5]`, and the median is 5.

* **Scenario 2: Two element list**
If `data` is `[5, 5]`, the sorted list is `[5, 5]`, the middle indices are 0 and 1, and the median is `(5 + 5) / 2 = 5`.

* **Scenario 3: Three element list**
If `data` is `[4, 5, 6]`, the sorted list is `[4, 5, 6]`, the middle index is 1, and the median is 5.

* **Scenario 4: Four element list**
If `data` is `[4, 5, 5, 6]`, the sorted list is `[4, 5, 5, 6]`, the middle indices are 1 and 2, and the median is `(5 + 5) / 2 = 5`.

* **Scenario 5: Five element list**
If `data` is `[1, 2, 5, 6, 7]`, the sorted list is `[1, 2, 5, 6, 7]`, the middle index is 2, and the median is 5.

Any of these scenarios would produce the desired output.  I'll choose the simplest one: `[5]`.
