Let's analyze the function `f(n)` and its output.

The function takes an integer `n`, converts it to a string, and then constructs a new string. The new string consists of the first digit of `n` followed by a dot (`.`), and then the rest of the digits with any hyphens (`-`) replaced by underscores (`_`).

The given output is "f.irst_second_third".

1. The first character of the output is 'f'. This means the first digit of the input `n` must be 'f'.
2. The second character is '.'. This is added by the function regardless of the input.
3. The remaining part is "irst_second_third". This corresponds to the rest of the digits of `n` after replacing '-' with '_'.

Therefore, the original string before the replacement must have been "irst-second-third".

Combining the first digit 'f' and the rest of the string, we get the original input as "first-second-third".
