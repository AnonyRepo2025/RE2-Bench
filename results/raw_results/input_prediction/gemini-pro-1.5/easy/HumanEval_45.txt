We are given the function `triangle_area(a, h)` which returns `a * h / 2.0`.
The output is 40.0.
We need to find `a` and `h` such that `a * h / 2.0 = 40.0`.
This simplifies to `a * h = 80.0`.
There are many possible solutions for `a` and `h`.
One possible solution is `a = 10` and `h = 8`.
Another possible solution is `a = 8` and `h = 10`.
Another possible solution is `a = 16` and `h = 5`.
Another possible solution is `a = 5` and `h = 16`.
Another possible solution is `a = 20` and `h = 4`.
Another possible solution is `a = 4` and `h = 20`.
Another possible solution is `a = 40` and `h = 2`.
Another possible solution is `a = 2` and `h = 40`.
Another possible solution is `a = 80` and `h = 1`.
Another possible solution is `a = 1` and `h = 80`.
Let's choose `a = 10` and `h = 8`.
