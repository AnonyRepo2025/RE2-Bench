Let the input text be `t` and `froms` be `f`.
The function `f` first removes leading characters from `t` that are present in `f`, and then removes trailing characters from the result that are present in `f`.
The output is "1co".

Let's consider some examples:
If `t` is "1co" and `f` is "", the output is "1co".
If `t` is "c1co" and `f` is "c", the output is "1co".
If `t` is "1coc" and `f` is "c", the output is "1co".
If `t` is "cc1cocc" and `f` is "c", the output is "1co".
If `t` is "1co1" and `f` is "1", the output is "co". This doesn't match.
If `t` is "o1co" and `f` is "o", the output is "1c". This doesn't match.

So, possible inputs are:
`text` = "1co", `froms` = ""
`text` = "c1co", `froms` = "c"
`text` = "1coc", `froms` = "c"
`text` = "cc1cocc", `froms` = "c"
and so on.

Let's choose the simplest one: `text` = "1co", `froms` = ""
