Let the input be `text`.
The output is "2:0".
The function `f(text)` returns a string of the form  `len(l[0]):l[2].find('0') + 1`, where `l = text.rpartition('0')`.
Since the output is not "-1:-1", `l[2]` is not empty.
We are given that `len(l[0])` is 2 and `l[2].find('0') + 1` is 0.
This means `l[2].find('0')` is -1, which implies that '0' is not present in `l[2]`.
Since `l = text.rpartition('0')`, `l` is a tuple of three strings: the part of `text` before the last occurrence of '0', the last occurrence of '0', and the part of `text` after the last occurrence of '0'.
We know that `len(l[0])` is 2, so the part of `text` before the last occurrence of '0' has length 2.
We also know that `l[2].find('0')` is -1, so '0' is not present in `l[2]`.
Let's consider an example: `text = "xx0y"`.
Then `l = text.rpartition('0')` gives `l = ("xx", "0", "y")`.
`len(l[0])` is 2.
`l[2].find('0')` is -1.
`l[2].find('0') + 1` is 0.
The output is "2:0".

So, a possible input is "xx0y".
Let's try another example: `text = "xx0"`.
Then `l = text.rpartition('0')` gives `l = ("xx", "0", "")`.
Since `l[2]` is empty, the output would be "-1:-1". This is not the desired output.

Let's try `text = "aa0b"`.
`l = text.rpartition('0')` gives `l = ("aa", "0", "b")`.
`len(l[0])` is 2.
`l[2].find('0')` is -1.
`l[2].find('0') + 1` is 0.
The output is "2:0".
