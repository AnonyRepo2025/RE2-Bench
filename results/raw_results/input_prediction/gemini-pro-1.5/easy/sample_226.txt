Let's trace the execution of the function `f(nums)` with the given output `[1, 3, 3]`.

The function iterates through the input list `nums` and appends any element divisible by 3 to the end of the list.

1. **Initial state:** `nums` is the input list (unknown at this point).
2. **First element:** Let's assume the first element is 1. Since 1 % 3 != 0, nothing is appended.
3. **Second element:** Let's assume the second element is 3. Since 3 % 3 == 0, 3 is appended to the end of the list.
4. **Resulting list:** At this point, the list would be `[1, 3, 3]`, which matches the output.

Therefore, the input list must have been `[1, 3]`.
