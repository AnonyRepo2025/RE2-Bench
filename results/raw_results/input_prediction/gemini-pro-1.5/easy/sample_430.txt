The function `f` takes two lists, `arr1` and `arr2`, copies `arr1` to `new_arr`, extends `new_arr` with `arr2`, and returns `new_arr`. The output is `[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`.

Since `new_arr` is initialized as a copy of `arr1` and then extended by `arr2`, the output list is a concatenation of `arr1` and `arr2`.  There are multiple possible inputs that could produce this output. One example is `arr1 = [5, 1, 3]` and `arr2 = [7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]`. Another example is `arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8]` and `arr2 = ["", 0, -1, []]`.  We can choose any split. Let's go with the first example.
