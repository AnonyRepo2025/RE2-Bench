Let the data be `[x1, x2, x3, x4]`.
The variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.
Let the mean be `m`.
Variance = ( (x1-m)^2 + (x2-m)^2 + (x3-m)^2 + (x4-m)^2 ) / 4 = 1.25
(x1-m)^2 + (x2-m)^2 + (x3-m)^2 + (x4-m)^2 = 5

Let's try a simple example: `data = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
mean = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5
variance = ((1-2.5)^2 + (2-2.5)^2 + (3-2.5)^2 + (4-2.5)^2)/4
= (2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25)/4
= 5/4 = 1.25

So, `data = [1, 2, 3, 4]` gives the desired output.
