The function returns `False` if the input string is not '42.42' and does not contain a '.' surrounded by at least three digits on each side.

Let's consider some examples:

- "123.456": returns `True` because the '.' is surrounded by three digits on each side.
- "12.456": returns `False` because there are only two digits before the '.'.
- "123.45": returns `False` because there are only two digits after the '.'.
- "123456": returns `False` because there is no '.'.
- "42.42": returns `True` because it matches the special case.
- "123a.456": returns `False` because 'a' is not a digit.
- "123.456b": returns `False` because 'b' is not a digit.
- ".": returns `False` because there are no digits around the '.'.
- "1234.5678": returns `True` because the '.' is surrounded by at least three digits on each side.

To make the function return `False`, we need a string that doesn't satisfy the conditions.  A simple example is a string without a dot, like "12345".  Another example is a string with a dot but not enough digits around it, like "12.45".

Let's choose "12.45" as the input.
