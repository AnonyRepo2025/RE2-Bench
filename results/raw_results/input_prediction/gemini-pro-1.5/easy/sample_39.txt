The function `f` returns the index of `elem` in `array` if it exists, otherwise it returns -1. Since the output is 0, it means the element exists in the array and its index is 0. Therefore, the element must be the first element in the array. The array can contain any number of elements as long as the first element is the same as `elem`.
