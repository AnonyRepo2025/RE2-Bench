The `read_file_as_json` method reads a file and parses its content as JSON.  The output is a Python dictionary containing the value 12345. Therefore, the input file must contain a JSON representation of this data.  The `file_path` argument should point to a file containing the JSON string `{"output": 12345}`.  I'll assume a filename of "data.json" for this example, but any valid file path containing the correct JSON would work.
