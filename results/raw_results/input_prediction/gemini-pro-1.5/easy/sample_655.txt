The function `f(s)` removes all occurrences of 'a' and 'r' from the input string `s`. The output is "p".  Therefore, the input string must have contained "p" and any number of "a" and "r" characters.  One possible input is "par", another is "arp", and yet another is "p".  Since we're looking for a simple input, "p" is a good choice.
