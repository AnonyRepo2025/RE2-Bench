Let's trace the execution of the function `f(text, chars)` with the given output "zbzquiuqnmfkx".

The function applies the replacement twice. Let's denote the original input text as `original_text` and the given `chars` as `c`.

1. **First iteration:**
   - `extra_chars = c`
   - `text = original_text.replace(c, '')`

2. **Second iteration:**
   - `extra_chars = cc`
   - `text = text.replace(cc, '')` (where `text` is the result from the first iteration)

The final `text` is "zbzquiuqnmfkx". We need to reverse this process to find the original input.

Let's assume `chars` is a single character. If `chars` is "a", then the final text wouldn't contain "a".  Since the output contains various characters, it's unlikely that `chars` is a single character from the output string.

Let's consider a case where `chars` is "ab".
- First replacement: removes all occurrences of "ab"
- Second replacement: removes all occurrences of "abab"

If we try to reverse this, we can't be sure how many "ab" or "abab" were removed.

Let's consider the case where the output string is formed by repeating a substring. For example, if the output is "xyzxyz", it's possible that the original string was "xyzxyzabab" or "xyzxyzabxyzab".

However, the given output "zbzquiuqnmfkx" doesn't seem to have such a repeating pattern.

Let's try a different approach. Let's assume `chars = "a"`.
- After the first replacement, no "a" is present.
- After the second replacement, no "aa" is present (which is already true after the first replacement).

So, let's assume the original text was "zbzquiuqnmfkx" with some "a"s inserted.  Since we don't see any obvious pattern, let's assume `chars` is a character not present in the output, like "a".

If `chars = "a"`, the code does:
1. Removes all "a"
2. Removes all "aa"

Since the output doesn't contain "a", the input could be the output itself, with "a" or "aa" added somewhere.  Let's try the simplest case where the input is the output string itself.
