The output is "816". Since the output contains only digits, the input `text` must have been an identifier. The function filters the input `text` and keeps only the digits. Therefore, the input `text` must be a string containing "8", "1", and "6", possibly interleaved with non-digit characters. For example, "a8b1c6d" or "8a1b6c".
