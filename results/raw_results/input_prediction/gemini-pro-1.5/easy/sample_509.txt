The output is "5". Since there is no padding, the width must be less than or equal to the length of `str(value)`.
If value is positive, `str(value).zfill(width)` should return "5".
If value is 5 and width is 1, the output is "5".
If value is 5 and width is 0, the output is "5".
If value is 5 and width is -1, the output is "5".

If value is negative,  `-` + `str(-value).zfill(width)` should return "5". This is impossible.

So value must be 5 and width can be any non-positive integer. Let's choose width = 1.
