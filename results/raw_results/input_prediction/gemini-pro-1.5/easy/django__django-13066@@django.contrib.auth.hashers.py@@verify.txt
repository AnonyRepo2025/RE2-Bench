[THOUGHT]
The `verify` function uses the `argon2` library to verify a password against an encoded hash.  To get a `True` output, the provided password must match the hash in the `encoded` argument.

The `encoded` argument is split into the algorithm and the rest of the hash. The algorithm must match `self.algorithm`, which is "argon2".

The `argon2.PasswordHasher().verify` function is called with the encoded hash and the password. This function returns `True` if the password matches the hash, and raises a `VerificationError` otherwise.

To produce the given output, we need to provide a valid `encoded` string that starts with "argon2$" and a `password` that matches the hash in the encoded string. We can create a dummy hash using the `argon2` library and then use the same password for verification.
