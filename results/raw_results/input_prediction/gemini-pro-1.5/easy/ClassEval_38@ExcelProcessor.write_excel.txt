The output is 1, which means the function executed successfully.  The function `write_excel` takes data and writes it to an Excel file.  Since the output is 1 (success), the input data could be any valid list of lists (or list of tuples, etc.) representing rows and columns of data, and the file name can be any valid file name.  I'll use a simple example.

[INPUT]
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "data": [
            [1, 2, 3],
            [4, 5, 6]
        ],
        "file_name": "output.xlsx"
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
