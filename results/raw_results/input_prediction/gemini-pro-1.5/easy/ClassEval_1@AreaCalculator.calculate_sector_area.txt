The formula for the area of a sector is given by:

Area = (radius^2 * angle) / 2

We are given the output area as 6.283185307179586. We need to find the radius and angle.

Let's assume the radius is 2.
Area = (2^2 * angle) / 2
6.283185307179586 = 2 * angle
angle = 6.283185307179586 / 2
angle = 3.141592653589793 which is approximately pi.

So, if radius = 2 and angle = pi, the area of the sector is approximately 2*pi.
