The function `f(nums)` first clears the input list `nums` using `nums.clear()`. Then, it iterates through the now-empty `nums` and appends each element multiplied by 2. Since the list is empty after the `clear()` operation, the loop does nothing. The function then returns the empty list.

Therefore, the input list `nums` can be any list. The content of the list doesn't matter because it's cleared at the beginning of the function.
