Let the input list be `numbers = [n1, n2, n3, ...]`.
The mean is calculated as `mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`.
The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is calculated as `MAD = sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)`.

The output is 0.6666666666666666, which is approximately 2/3.

Let's try a simple example with three numbers: `numbers = [a, b, c]`.
`mean = (a + b + c) / 3`
`MAD = (abs(a - mean) + abs(b - mean) + abs(c - mean)) / 3`

Let's consider a simple case: `numbers = [1, 2, 3]`.
`mean = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2`
`MAD = (abs(1 - 2) + abs(2 - 2) + abs(3 - 2)) / 3 = (1 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 2/3`

So, `numbers = [1, 2, 3]` gives the desired output.
