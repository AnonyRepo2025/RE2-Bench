The function `f` takes a list and an operation as input. It sorts a copy of the list and then applies the operation to the sorted copy. The original list is returned. This means the operation does not affect the original list.

The output is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`. This is the original list.

Let's assume the operation is `lambda x: x`. This operation does nothing. The sorted copy would be `[2, 4, 6, 8, 15]`. The function returns the original list, which is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.
