Let's analyze the possible inputs for the given output.

The output is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.". This means the function didn't return '-' so the text after stripping wasn't empty.

If `chars` is not empty, the function strips `text` by `chars`. If `chars` is empty or None, the function strips `text` by spaces.

Since the output string doesn't contain trailing spaces, and it contains characters other than spaces, it's likely that `chars` was either None or empty, and the input `text` had trailing spaces.

Let's assume `chars` was None or empty. Then the function would strip trailing spaces from `text`.  The output is "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.". So, a possible input `text` could be "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. " (with one or more trailing spaces).
