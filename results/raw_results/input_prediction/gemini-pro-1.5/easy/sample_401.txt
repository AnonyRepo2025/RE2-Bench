Let's analyze the possible inputs for the function `f(text, suffix)` given the output "mathematics".

The function removes the `suffix` from the `text` if the `text` ends with the `suffix` and `suffix` is not empty. Otherwise, it returns the original `text`.

Scenario 1: The suffix was removed.
If the suffix was removed, then the original text must have been "mathematics" + `suffix`.  Let's consider a few examples:
- `text` = "mathematics_ian", `suffix` = "_ian". The output would be "mathematics".
- `text` = "mathematics_s", `suffix` = "_s". The output would be "mathematics".

Scenario 2: The suffix was not removed.
If the suffix was not removed, it's either because the text didn't end with the suffix or the suffix was empty.
- `text` = "mathematics", `suffix` = "". The output would be "mathematics".
- `text` = "mathematics", `suffix` = "s". The output would be "mathematics".
- `text` = "mathematics", `suffix` = "ian". The output would be "mathematics".


Let's choose the simplest case where the suffix is empty.
