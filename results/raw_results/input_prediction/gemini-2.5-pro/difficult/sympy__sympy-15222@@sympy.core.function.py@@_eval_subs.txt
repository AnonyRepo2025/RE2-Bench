[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the target function `_eval_subs` and its output.**
    The function is `Application._eval_subs(self, old, new)`.
    The output is the string `"2*x"`. This corresponds to the SymPy expression `2*x`.
    The core logic of the function is:
    ```python
    if old.is_Function and new.is_Function and callable(old) and callable(new) and (old == self.func) and (len(self.args) in new.nargs):
        return new(*[i._subs(old, new) for i in self.args])
    ```
    The return value of this function must be an expression that evaluates to `2*x`.

2.  **Deconstruct the `if` condition to infer the properties of `self`, `old`, and `new`.**
    -   `self`: An instance of a function application. Let's assume the simplest form that could lead to the output, like `F(x)`, where `F` is a function class and `x` is a `Symbol`.
    -   `self.func`: This would be the class `F`.
    -   `self.args`: This would be a tuple `(x,)`.
    -   `len(self.args)`: This would be `1`.
    -   `old == self.func`: This condition requires that the `old` object (the function to be substituted) must be the same as the function class of the `self` instance. So, `old` must be the class `F`.
    -   `len(self.args) in new.nargs`: Since `len(self.args)` is 1, this means `1` must be in the set of allowed argument counts for the `new` function. `new.nargs` must be a set containing `1`.

3.  **Analyze the return statement.**
    If the condition is true, the function returns `new(*[i._subs(old, new) for i in self.args])`.
    -   `self.args` is `(x,)`.
    -   The loop iterates once with `i = x`.
    -   `i._subs(old, new)` becomes `x._subs(F, new)`. Since the symbol `x` does not contain the function `F`, this substitution has no effect and returns `x` itself.
    -   The arguments to `new` become `(x,)`.
    -   The return value is `new(x)`.

4.  **Connect the return value to the final output.**
    The expression `new(x)` must evaluate to `2*x`. This means that `new` must be a function class whose `eval` method is defined to multiply its argument by 2. For example:
    ```python
    class G(Function):
        @classmethod
        def eval(cls, arg):
            return 2 * arg
    ```
    So, `new` is a class like `G`.

5.  **Translate these inferences into the provided JSON structure.**
    -   **`args.new`**: This represents the `new` function class (`G`). The structure is `{"nargs": {"_elements": XXX}}`. This corresponds to the `nargs` property, which is a `FiniteSet`. Since `new` must accept one argument, `new.nargs` must be `FiniteSet(1)`. Therefore, `_elements` must be `[1]`.
    -   **`args.old`**: This represents the `old` function class (`F`). The structure provides a `_nargs` field. Since `self` is an application of `old` with one argument (`F(x)`), the class `F` must be defined to take one argument. Thus, `old._nargs` should be `1`. The other fields like `__module__` and `__doc__` are non-essential for the logic and can be filled with plausible placeholders.
    -   **`self`**: The structure for `self` is `{"nargs": {}}`. This is likely a simplified representation. The important properties of `self` (`self.func` and `self.args`) are implicitly determined by our choice for `old` and the overall logic. `self` is an instance of `old` with one argument.
    -   **`kwargs`**: The structure shows this is empty.

6.  **Final verification.**
    -   `self` is an instance of `old`, e.g., `F(x)`.
    -   `old` is class `F`, with `_nargs=1`.
    -   `new` is class `G`, with `nargs=FiniteSet(1)`.
    -   `_eval_subs(self=F(x), old=F, new=G)` is called.
    -   The `if` condition `(F == F) and (1 in FiniteSet(1))` is true.
    -   The function returns `G(x)`.
    -   `G(x)` evaluates to `2*x`.
    -   The string representation is `"2*x"`, which matches the output. The logic holds.
