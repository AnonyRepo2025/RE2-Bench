1.  **Analyze the Output:** The function `confusion_matrix` returns a NumPy array. The provided output is `[[20 20]\n [10 50]]`. This is a 2x2 matrix, which typically represents the outcome of a binary classification task. Let's represent this as `cm = np.array([[20, 20], [10, 50]])`.

2.  **Understand the Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix `C` is structured such that `C[i, j]` is the number of observations (or sum of sample weights) known to be in class `i` but predicted to be in class `j`.

3.  **Determine Labels:** For a 2x2 matrix, there are two classes. The `labels` argument determines the order of these classes. If `labels` is not provided (`None`), the function determines the labels by taking the sorted unique values from `y_true` and `y_pred`. Let's assume the simplest case where the labels are `0` and `1`. The sorted order would be `[0, 1]`.
    *   Row 0 corresponds to true label `0`.
    *   Row 1 corresponds to true label `1`.
    *   Column 0 corresponds to predicted label `0`.
    *   Column 1 corresponds to predicted label `1`.

4.  **Interpret the Matrix Cells:** Based on the assumed labels `[0, 1]`:
    *   `cm[0, 0] = 20`: 20 instances of `y_true=0` were correctly predicted as `y_pred=0`.
    *   `cm[0, 1] = 20`: 20 instances of `y_true=0` were incorrectly predicted as `y_pred=1`.
    *   `cm[1, 0] = 10`: 10 instances of `y_true=1` were incorrectly predicted as `y_pred=0`.
    *   `cm[1, 1] = 50`: 50 instances of `y_true=1` were correctly predicted as `y_pred=1`.

5.  **Consider `sample_weight`:** The values in the confusion matrix are the sums of `sample_weight` for each category. If `sample_weight` is `None`, it defaults to 1 for each sample, and the matrix values are simple counts. We can use the `sample_weight` parameter to construct a minimal input that produces the desired matrix.

6.  **Construct Input Arrays:** We can represent each of the four cells of the matrix with a single data point pair `(y_true, y_pred)` and assign the cell's value as its `sample_weight`.
    *   To get `cm[0, 0] = 20`, we need a pair `(y_true=0, y_pred=0)` with `sample_weight=20`.
    *   To get `cm[0, 1] = 20`, we need a pair `(y_true=0, y_pred=1)` with `sample_weight=20`.
    *   To get `cm[1, 0] = 10`, we need a pair `(y_true=1, y_pred=0)` with `sample_weight=10`.
    *   To get `cm[1, 1] = 50`, we need a pair `(y_true=1, y_pred=1)` with `sample_weight=50`.

7.  **Assemble the Final Input:** We can combine these into arrays:
    *   `y_true` will be `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.
    *   `y_pred` will be `[0, 1, 0, 1]`.
    *   `sample_weight` will be `[20, 20, 10, 50]`.
    *   `labels` can be set to `None`, as the function will correctly infer and sort the labels to `[0, 1]`.

8.  **Verify the Logic:**
    *   The function receives `y_true`, `y_pred`, and `sample_weight`.
    *   It determines `labels` as `[0, 1]`.
    *   It creates a mapping `label_to_ind = {0: 0, 1: 1}`.
    *   It then builds a sparse matrix using `(sample_weight, (y_true, y_pred))` as data and coordinates.
        *   `data = [20, 20, 10, 50]`
        *   `coords = ([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1])`
    *   This populates the matrix at `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, and `(1,1)` with the corresponding weights, resulting in `[[20, 20], [10, 50]]`.
    *   The `normalize` parameter is `None` by default, so the integer values are preserved. This matches the output.

This reconstruction is consistent with the function's implementation.
