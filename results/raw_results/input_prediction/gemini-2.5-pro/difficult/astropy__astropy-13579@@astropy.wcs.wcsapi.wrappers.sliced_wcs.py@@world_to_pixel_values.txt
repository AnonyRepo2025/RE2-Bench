[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to predict the input for the `SlicedLowLevelWCS.world_to_pixel_values` function that results in the given output.

**1. Analyze the Output**
The output is `[-2.9416469260468148e-12, -7.123190925995004e-13]`. This is a list containing two very small floating-point numbers, which are essentially numerical noise around zero. The function is expected to return a tuple of numbers, which is then likely serialized to a list of strings. The fact that there are two values suggests the output pixel space is 2-dimensional.

**2. Analyze the Input Structure**
The structure specifies `args: {}` and `kwargs: {}`. This means the function is called without any positional or keyword arguments: `self.world_to_pixel_values()`. So, the `world_arrays` tuple inside the function will be empty.

**3. Step-by-step analysis of `world_to_pixel_values`**

*   **`world_arrays` is empty.**
*   The code first calculates `sliced_out_world_coords`:
    ```python
    sliced_out_world_coords = self._pixel_to_world_values_all(*[0] * len(self._pixel_keep))
    ```
    Since the output has two dimensions, it's reasonable to assume the effective pixel dimension `self.pixel_n_dim` is 2. `self.pixel_n_dim` is defined as `len(self._pixel_keep)`. Therefore, `self._pixel_keep` should be a list/tuple of length 2, for example, `[0, 1]`. The call becomes `self._pixel_to_world_values_all(0, 0)`.

*   Inside `_pixel_to_world_values_all(0, 0)`:
    This helper function constructs a full-dimensional pixel coordinate array. The `_pixel_keep` attribute holds indices of dimensions that are slices, while other dimensions are fixed integer values. Since we assumed `_pixel_keep = [0, 1]` and the underlying WCS is likely 2D (`self._wcs.pixel_n_dim = 2`), both dimensions are slices. Let's assume the simplest slices: `slice(None, None, None)`.
    The code iterates through `self._wcs.pixel_n_dim`. For each dimension that is a slice (i.e., its index is in `_pixel_keep`), it uses the corresponding value from the input `pixel_arrays` (which are `(0, 0)`). If the slice has a `start` value, it's added. With `start=None`, the new pixel array `pixel_arrays_new` becomes `[0, 0]`.
    Finally, it calls `self._wcs.pixel_to_world_values(0, 0)`. This converts the pixel coordinate `(0, 0)` to a world coordinate, let's call it `(w0, w1)`.
    So, `sliced_out_world_coords` will be `(w0, w1)`.

*   Back in `world_to_pixel_values`:
    The code then constructs `world_arrays_new`. It iterates from `iworld = 0` to `self._wcs.world_n_dim - 1`.
    ```python
    if iworld in self._world_keep:
        # ... uses input world_arrays
    else:
        world_arrays_new.append(sliced_out_world_coords[iworld])
    ```
    Since the input `world_arrays` is empty, if `_world_keep` were not empty, this would lead to an `IndexError`. Therefore, `self._world_keep` must be empty `[]`.
    This means the `else` branch is always taken. `world_arrays_new` becomes a copy of `sliced_out_world_coords`, i.e., `[w0, w1]`.

*   The next step is the core transformation:
    ```python
    pixel_arrays = list(self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values(*world_arrays_new))
    ```
    This calls `self._wcs.world_to_pixel_values(w0, w1)`. This is the inverse transformation of the one performed earlier. We are doing a round trip: `(0, 0)` -> `(w0, w1)` -> `(p0, p1)`.
    Ideally, `(p0, p1)` should be exactly `(0, 0)`. However, due to floating-point inaccuracies in the WCS transformation algorithms (especially if distortion is involved, as suggested by the call stack), the result will be very close to zero but not exactly zero. This perfectly explains the output values. `pixel_arrays` will be `[-2.94e-12, -7.12e-13]`.

*   The code then adjusts the pixel values based on `slice.start`. Since we assumed `start=None`, this step does nothing.

*   Finally, the code selects the pixel dimensions to return using `_pixel_keep`:
    ```python
    pixel = tuple((pixel_arrays[ip] for ip in self._pixel_keep))
    ```
    With `_pixel_keep = [0, 1]`, this returns `(pixel_arrays[0], pixel_arrays[1])`, which is the tuple `(-2.94e-12, -7.12e-13)`. This matches the output.

**4. Construct the Input**
Based on the analysis, we can construct the input:
*   `args` and `kwargs` are empty.
*   `self._pixel_keep` should be `[0, 1]`.
*   `self._world_keep` should be `[]`.
*   `self._slices_pixel` should contain two slices. `slice(None, None, None)` is the simplest choice.
*   `self._wcs` should be a 2D WCS object. So, `naxis` and `_naxis` should be 2.
*   Other attributes like `_slices_array` and `_pixel_bounds` are not critical for this code path and can be `null`.
*   The `_init_kwargs` for `_wcs` can be set to default/empty values.

This configuration logically leads to the observed output. The exact tiny non-zero values are a product of the specific WCS parameters and the floating-point implementation, which we don't need to reverse-engineer. We only need to provide a valid input that follows the execution path producing such a result.
