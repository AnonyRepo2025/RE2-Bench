[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the input for the `map` function that produces the output `[0.0, [0.0]]`.

**1. Analyze the Target Output:**
The output is `[0.0, [0.0]]`. In Python terms, this corresponds to the tuple `(0.0, [0.0])`. The first element is the mean average precision (MAP), and the second is a list of individual average precision (AP) scores. The output indicates that the mean AP is 0.0, and there was only one AP score calculated, which was also 0.0.

**2. Analyze the `map` function's logic:**
The function has several branches that can lead to the desired output.

*   **Branch 1: Empty input**
    ```python
    if len(data) == 0:
        return (0.0, [0.0])
    ```
    If the input `data` is an empty list `[]` or an empty tuple `()`, this condition is met, and the function returns the target output directly. This is a possible and very simple solution.

*   **Branch 2: Tuple input `(sub_list, total_num)`**
    The code handles a single tuple input.
    *   **Sub-branch 2a: `total_num` is zero**
        ```python
        if total_num == 0:
            return (0.0, [0.0])
        ```
        If the input is a tuple where the second element (`total_num`) is 0, the function returns the target output. For example, `data = ([], 0)` or `data = ([1, 0, 1], 0)`. This is another direct way to get the result.
    *   **Sub-branch 2b: AP calculation results in zero**
        The average precision `ap` is calculated as `np.sum(np.array(right_ranking_list) * ranking_array) / total_num`. For `ap` to be 0, the numerator `np.sum(...)` must be 0. This happens if `right_ranking_list` contains only zeros. The `right_ranking_list` is built by iterating through `sub_list`. If an element `t` is 0, a 0 is appended. If `t` is not 0, a positive count is appended. Therefore, `right_ranking_list` will be all zeros if and only if `sub_list` contains only zeros.
        So, any input tuple like `([0, 0, 0], 5)` where `sub_list` has only zeros and `total_num` is positive will result in `ap = 0.0` and the function will return `(0.0, [0.0])`.

*   **Branch 3: List of tuples input**
    The function calculates an AP for each tuple in the list and returns the mean and the list of APs. To get `(0.0, [0.0])`, the input list must contain exactly one tuple, and that tuple must result in an AP of 0.0. We've already identified how to get an AP of 0.0 in Branch 2. So, an input like `[([], 0)]` or `[([0, 0], 3)]` would work.

**3. Select a Simple and Representative Input:**
All the scenarios above are valid. A good choice is one that is simple and clearly demonstrates one of the logic paths. The case where `total_num` is 0 is an explicit check in the code that leads directly to the output. Let's choose an input that triggers this condition.

Let's use `data = ([], 0)`.
1.  `map` is called with `data = ([], 0)`.
2.  The code enters the `if type(data) == tuple:` block.
3.  `sub_list` becomes `[]` and `total_num` becomes `0`.
4.  The condition `if total_num == 0:` is true.
5.  The function returns `(0.0, [0.0])`.
This matches the output perfectly.

**4. Format the Input:**
The input structure requires the value for `data`. The Python tuple `([], 0)` is represented in JSON as an array `[[], 0]`.

Therefore, the final input will be:
```json
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "data": [
            [],
            0
        ]
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
