[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Python Code:**
    * The script starts by reading four integers from standard input, which are assigned to variables `H`, `W`, `A`, and `B`.
    * It then calls the `solve(H, W, A, B)` function.
    * The `solve` function initializes an `H`x`W` grid (2D list) named `answer` with all elements as the character '0'.
    * It then iterates through each cell `(i, j)` of this grid, where `i` is the row index and `j` is the column index.
    * The core logic is a set of nested `if/elif/else` conditions that determine the final value of `answer[i][j]`. Let's break down this logic:
        * **Top part (rows `i < B`):**
            * For columns `j < A` (top-left), the value remains '0'.
            * For columns `j >= A` (top-right), the value is set to '1'.
        * **Bottom part (rows `i >= B`):**
            * For columns `j < A` (bottom-left), the value is set to '1'.
            * For columns `j >= A` (bottom-right), the value remains '0'.
    * Finally, the script iterates through the `H` rows of the `answer` grid, joins the characters in each row into a string, and prints the string. Each `print` statement adds a newline.

2.  **Analyze the Provided Output:**
    * The output is a large block of text. Let's examine its structure.
    * It consists of many lines of identical characters.
    * The first part of the output is composed of lines containing only '1's.
    * The second part of the output is composed of lines containing only '0's.
    * Let's count the number of lines to determine `H`. By copying the output into a text editor, we can see there are 1000 lines in total. So, `H = 1000`.
    * Let's count the number of characters in a single line to determine `W`. The first line consists of 1000 '1's. So, `W = 1000`.
    * Now, let's determine the split point between the '1's and '0's. The first 500 lines are all '1's, and the remaining 500 lines are all '0's.

3.  **Deduce the Input Variables (A and B):**
    * We need to find values for `A` and `B` that produce this specific output pattern with `H=1000` and `W=1000`.
    * **Consider the rows of all '1's (rows 0 to 499):**
        * For a row `i` to be all '1's, the condition that sets a cell to '0' must never be met.
        * Let's take a row `i` where `i < B`. The cells `answer[i][j]` are set to '0' if `j < A`. To make the entire row '1's, we must ensure that `j < A` is never true for any `j` from 0 to `W-1`. This happens if `A <= 0`. Since `A` is likely a non-negative index, the simplest case is `A = 0`.
        * If `A = 0`, then for any row `i < B`, the condition `j < A` (`j < 0`) is always false. The `else` part (`answer[i][j] = '1'`) is always executed. This makes the entire row '1's. This matches the first part of our output.
    * **Consider the rows of all '0's (rows 500 to 999):**
        * For a row `i` to be all '0's, the condition that sets a cell to '1' must never be met.
        * Let's take a row `i` where `i >= B`. The cells `answer[i][j]` are set to '1' if `j < A`. To make the entire row '0's, we must ensure that `j < A` is never true. Again, this happens if `A = 0`.
        * If `A = 0`, then for any row `i >= B`, the condition `j < A` (`j < 0`) is always false. The `else` part (`answer[i][j] = '0'`) is always executed. This makes the entire row '0's. This matches the second part of our output.
    * **Putting it together:**
        * We've established that `A = 0` works for both parts of the output.
        * The switch from all '1's to all '0's happens between row 499 and row 500.
        * The code's logic switches when `i` is no longer less than `B`.
        * So, for `i = 0..499`, we need `i < B`. This means `499 < B`.
        * For `i = 500..999`, we need `i >= B`. This means `500 >= B`.
        * The only integer `B` that satisfies both `499 < B` and `B <= 500` is `B = 500`.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    * The input values must be `H = 1000`, `W = 1000`, `A = 0`, and `B = 500`.
    * The program reads these as a single space-separated string.
    * Therefore, the input string is "1000 1000 0 500".
