1.  **Analyze the Target Output:** The output is `2.2204460492503136e-16`. This is a very specific number, recognizable as `np.finfo(np.float64).eps`, the machine epsilon for 64-bit floats.

2.  **Trace the `eps` Parameter:** Inside the `log_loss` function, there's this block:
    ```python
    if eps == 'auto':
        eps = np.finfo(y_pred.dtype).eps
    ```
    This confirms that if we provide `eps='auto'` as input and `y_pred` is a NumPy array with `dtype=np.float64`, the internal `eps` variable will be set to our target output value. The `check_array` function will likely convert a list of floats like `[0.0, 1.0]` into a `float64` array by default.

3.  **Analyze the Loss Calculation:** The core of the log loss calculation is `loss = -xlogy(transformed_labels, y_pred).sum(axis=1)`. For a single binary classification sample, this simplifies to `-log(p)` where `p` is the predicted probability of the true class.

4.  **Analyze the Clipping Behavior:** A crucial step before the loss calculation is `y_pred = np.clip(y_pred, eps, 1 - eps)`. This prevents taking the logarithm of zero.
    -   If we make a perfect prediction of `1.0` for a positive class, the value `1.0` will be clipped to `1 - eps`.
    -   If we make a perfect prediction of `0.0` for a positive class (i.e., the true class is negative), the value `0.0` will be clipped to `eps`.

5.  **Connect Clipping to the Final Loss:**
    -   Let's consider a single sample that is perfectly classified. For instance, `y_true = [1]` and we predict `y_pred = [1.0]`.
    -   The predicted probability `1.0` is clipped to `1 - eps`.
    -   The loss for this sample will be `-log(1 - eps)`.
    -   Using the Taylor series approximation `log(1 - x) ≈ -x` for very small `x`, we get `-log(1 - eps) ≈ -(-eps) = eps`.
    -   A quick check in Python confirms this: `-np.log(1 - np.finfo(np.float64).eps)` yields `2.2204460492503136e-16`.
    -   The same result occurs for a perfectly classified negative sample (`y_true = [0]`, `y_pred = [0.0]`). The probability for the true class (class 0) is `1 - y_pred`, which becomes `1 - eps` after clipping, leading to the same loss of `-log(1 - eps)`.

6.  **Construct the Input:**
    -   The function returns the average loss over all samples (since `normalize=True` by default). To get a final output of `eps`, the loss for every sample must be `eps`.
    -   This means every sample in our input must be perfectly classified.
    -   The function also requires at least two unique labels in `y_true` to avoid raising a `ValueError`.
    -   The simplest input that satisfies these conditions is a two-sample binary classification problem where both samples are predicted correctly.
    -   Let `y_true = [0, 1]`.
    -   The corresponding perfect predictions for the positive class (class 1) are `y_pred = [0.0, 1.0]`.
    -   Set `eps` to `'auto'` to use the machine epsilon.

7.  **Final Verification:**
    -   `y_true = [0, 1]`, `y_pred = [0.0, 1.0]`, `eps = 'auto'`.
    -   The internal `eps` will be `np.finfo(np.float64).eps`.
    -   The clipped `y_pred` for the two samples will result in probabilities of `1 - eps` for the correct class in both cases.
    -   The loss for each sample will be `-log(1 - eps)`, which is numerically equal to `eps`.
    -   The average loss will be `(eps + eps) / 2 = eps`.
    -   This matches the desired output.
