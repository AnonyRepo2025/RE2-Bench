The user wants me to find the input for the `orthogonal_mp_gram` function that produces the given output.

**1. Analyze the Output:**
The output is a string representation of a NumPy array: `"[0.         0.         0.         0.         2.15579371 0.\n 0.         0.         0.         0.         0.         0.        ]"`.
This corresponds to a 1D array of length 12.
- The array has only one non-zero element.
- The non-zero element is at index 4.
- The value of the non-zero element is `2.15579371`.

**2. Analyze the `orthogonal_mp_gram` function:**
- The function computes the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit solution.
- The final result is stored in the `coef` variable, which is initialized as a zero array with shape `(len(Gram), ...)`. The length of the output array (12) tells us that `len(Gram)` must be 12. So, `Gram` is a 12x12 matrix.
- The core computation happens in the `_gram_omp` function, which is called iteratively. Since the output is 1D, `Xy` was likely a 1D array, and the loop runs only once.
- The `_gram_omp` function iteratively selects the "atom" (feature) most correlated with the current residual. The number of atoms to select is determined by `n_nonzero_coefs` or `tol`.
- The output has only one non-zero coefficient. This strongly suggests that `n_nonzero_coefs` was set to 1. When `n_nonzero_coefs` is specified, `tol` is typically `None`.

**3. Simulate the execution with `n_nonzero_coefs=1`:**
- The `_gram_omp` function will run for only one iteration.
- **Inside `_gram_omp` (first and only iteration):**
    - `alpha` is initialized with the input `Xy`. `alpha` represents the correlation of each feature with the residual.
    - The algorithm selects the feature with the highest absolute correlation: `lam = np.argmax(np.abs(alpha))`.
    - To get a non-zero coefficient at index 4, the maximum absolute value in `Xy` must be at index 4.
    - After selecting the feature `lam=4`, the algorithm calculates the coefficient value. It solves a small linear system. The coefficient `gamma` is computed via `potrs(L[:n_active, :n_active], Xy[:n_active], ...)`.
    - For the first iteration (`n_active=1`), `L[0, 0]` is `sqrt(Gram[lam, lam])`. The system to solve is `L[0, 0] * gamma[0] = Xy[lam]`.
    - This simplifies to `gamma[0] = Xy[lam] / sqrt(Gram[lam, lam])`.
- **Back in `orthogonal_mp_gram`:**
    - The function receives the calculated coefficient `gamma` and its index `idx` (which is `[lam]`).
    - It places this coefficient into the final `coef` array: `coef[idx, k] = gamma`.
    - So, `coef[4]` will be `gamma[0]`.

**4. Reconstruct the Inputs:**
- To make the calculation simple and directly yield the output value, we can make some assumptions.
- Let's assume `Gram` is the identity matrix (`np.identity(12)`). This means `Gram[4, 4] = 1.0`.
- With `Gram[4, 4] = 1.0`, the coefficient calculation becomes `gamma[0] = Xy[4] / sqrt(1.0) = Xy[4]`.
- The output value at index 4 is `2.15579371`. Therefore, `Xy[4]` must be `2.15579371`.
- To ensure that index 4 is chosen, `Xy[4]` must be the element with the largest absolute value in `Xy`. The simplest way to achieve this is to set all other elements of `Xy` to 0.

**5. Final Input Configuration:**
- `Gram`: A 12x12 identity matrix.
- `Xy`: A 12-element array with `2.15579371` at index 4 and 0.0 everywhere else.
- `n_nonzero_coefs`: `1`.
- `tol`: `None` (represented as `null` in JSON).
- `norms_squared`: This is not used when `tol` is `None`, so we can set it to `None` (`null`).
- `copy_Xy`: The value doesn't affect the outcome, so we can use a default like `True`.

This configuration will cause the algorithm to select feature 4 in the first step, calculate its coefficient as `2.15579371`, and then stop because `n_nonzero_coefs=1` is reached. The final result will be an array of zeros with `2.15579371` at index 4, matching the output.
