1.  **Analyze the target function `_eval_Eq` and the desired output.**
    The function `_eval_Eq(self, other)` is a method of the `MatrixExpr` class. The desired output is `True`.

2.  **Examine the code of `_eval_Eq` to find the path to `True`.**
    ```python
    def _eval_Eq(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, MatrixExpr):
            return False  # First hurdle
        if self.shape != other.shape:
            return False  # Second hurdle
        if (self - other).is_ZeroMatrix:
            return True   # The winning condition
        return Eq(self, other, evaluate=False)
    ```
    To get `True`, three conditions must be met:
    a. `other` must be an instance of `MatrixExpr`.
    b. `self.shape` must be equal to `other.shape`.
    c. The expression `(self - other)` must have the property `is_ZeroMatrix` evaluate to `True`.

3.  **Devise a strategy to meet these conditions.**
    The most straightforward way to satisfy condition (c) is to make `self` and `other` mathematically equal. If `self` and `other` represent the same matrix, then their difference `self - other` will be a zero matrix. This choice will also automatically satisfy condition (b), as equal matrices must have the same shape. Condition (a) is satisfied by choosing any concrete subclass of `MatrixExpr`.

4.  **Select a simple, concrete `MatrixExpr` subclass.**
    The `ZeroMatrix` class is a simple and suitable choice. It represents a matrix where all elements are zero. Let's choose `self` and `other` to be the same `ZeroMatrix` instance. For example, `ZeroMatrix(3, 4)`.

5.  **Verify the choice against the conditions.**
    *   Let `self = ZeroMatrix(3, 4)` and `other = ZeroMatrix(3, 4)`.
    *   **Condition (a):** `ZeroMatrix` is a subclass of `MatrixExpr`, so `isinstance(other, MatrixExpr)` is `True`.
    *   **Condition (b):** `self.shape` is `(3, 4)` and `other.shape` is `(3, 4)`. They are equal, so `self.shape != other.shape` is `False`.
    *   **Condition (c):** The expression `self - other` becomes `ZeroMatrix(3, 4) - ZeroMatrix(3, 4)`. The subtraction of a matrix from itself results in a zero matrix of the same dimensions, i.e., `ZeroMatrix(3, 4)`. The `is_ZeroMatrix` property of any `ZeroMatrix` instance is `True`.

6.  **Construct the input in the required JSON format.**
    I need to represent the `ZeroMatrix(3, 4)` object. Based on common serialization patterns for such frameworks, an object can be represented by its class name and constructor arguments. The `ZeroMatrix` constructor takes two integer arguments, `n` (rows) and `m` (cols).
    So, `ZeroMatrix(3, 4)` can be represented as:
    ```json
    {
        "__class__": "ZeroMatrix",
        "__args__": [3, 4]
    }
    ```
    I will use this representation for both `self` and `other`. The `kwargs` dictionary is empty as no keyword arguments are passed.

7.  **Final Assembly.**
    Putting it all together into the provided structure:
    - `self` becomes the JSON representation of `ZeroMatrix(3, 4)`.
    - `args.other` also becomes the JSON representation of `ZeroMatrix(3, 4)`.
    - `kwargs` is `{}`.
This fulfills all requirements to make the function return `True`.
