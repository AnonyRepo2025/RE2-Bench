[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the input `expr` for the function `exptrigsimp` that results in the output `1/(y*tanh(1))`.

Let's analyze the function `exptrigsimp` step-by-step to understand its behavior.

1.  **`newexpr = bottom_up(expr, exp_trig)`**: This part applies the `exp_trig` function from the leaves of the expression tree upwards. `exp_trig(e)` rewrites an expression `e` containing trigonometric or hyperbolic functions into its exponential form (`e.rewrite(exp)`) or cosine form (`e.rewrite(cos)`) only if doing so reduces the number of operations (`count_ops`). Generally, rewriting to exponential form increases complexity, so this step often does nothing unless the expression is specifically structured to be simplified by this rewrite (e.g., `(exp(I*x)+exp(-I*x))/2` simplifies to `cos(x)`). If the input `expr` has no trig/hyperbolic functions, `exp_trig` will not change it.

2.  **`newexpr = bottom_up(newexpr, f)`**: This is the core simplification logic for exponential expressions. The function `f` is applied bottom-up. It specifically looks for `Mul` objects and tries to find patterns in their factors. The relevant patterns for this problem are:
    *   It can combine `(c*(1+exp(x)))**m` and `(1-exp(x))**(-m)` into `(-c/tanh(x/2))**m`.
    *   It can combine `(c*(1-exp(x)))**m` and `(1+exp(x))**(-m)` into `(-c*tanh(x/2))**m`.
    *   It can combine `e**(-x*m/2)` and `(c*(1+exp(x)))**m` into `(2*c*cosh(x/2))**m`.
    *   It can combine `e**(-x*m/2)` and `(c*(1-exp(x)))**m` into `(-2*c*sinh(x/2))**m`.

3.  **`if newexpr.has(HyperbolicFunction): ...`**: If the result from step 2 contains hyperbolic functions, it converts them to trigonometric functions (`hyper_as_trig`), applies a simplification routine `TR2i`, and then converts them back. `TR2i` converts trig functions to complex exponentials, but as a simplification routine, it can often perform simplifications that result in other forms.

4.  **`if newexpr.has(TrigonometricFunction): ...`**: If the result has trig functions, it applies `TR2i`.

5.  **Return**: The function returns the simplified expression, but only if it hasn't introduced a complex number `I` where there was none in the original expression.

**Working Backwards from the Output**

The output is `1/(y*tanh(1))`. This is equivalent to `coth(1)/y`.

Let's assume the input `expr` is an exponential expression that gets simplified by the function. A natural candidate for an input that simplifies to `coth(1)/y` is the exponential representation of `coth(1)/y`.

`coth(z) = (exp(z) + exp(-z)) / (exp(z) - exp(-z))`.
Multiplying numerator and denominator by `exp(z)` gives `(exp(2*z) + 1) / (exp(2*z) - 1)`.
For `z=1`, `coth(1) = (exp(2) + 1) / (exp(2) - 1)`.
So, a plausible input `expr` is `(exp(2) + 1) / (y * (exp(2) - 1))`.

Let's trace the execution with this input: `expr = (exp(2)+1)/(y*(exp(2)-1))`.

1.  **`bottom_up(expr, exp_trig)`**: The input `expr` does not contain any trigonometric or hyperbolic functions. Therefore, the `exp_trig` function will not change it. `newexpr` remains `(exp(2)+1)/(y*(exp(2)-1))`.

2.  **`bottom_up(newexpr, f)`**: The function `f` is applied to `newexpr`.
    *   The expression can be seen as a multiplication: `(exp(2)+1) * y**(-1) * (exp(2)-1)**(-1)`.
    *   To match the pattern in `f`, we rewrite this as: `(-1) * (exp(2)+1) * y**(-1) * (1-exp(2))**(-1)`.
    *   The factors are `k_1 = (1+exp(2))` with power `m=1`, and `k_2 = (1-exp(2))` with power `-1`.
    *   The function `f` will identify the pattern `(c*(1+exp(x)))**m` and check for the presence of `(1-exp(x))**(-m)`.
    *   Here, for `k_1`, we have `c=1`, `x=2`, `sign=1`, and `m=1`.
    *   The code checks if the factor `(1 - sign*exp(x))`, which is `(1-exp(2))`, exists with power `-m = -1`. It does.
    *   The code then replaces these two factors with `(-c/tanh(x/2))**m`.
    *   With `c=1`, `x=2`, `m=1`, this becomes `(-1/tanh(1))**1 = -1/tanh(1)`.
    *   The other factors in the multiplication are `y**(-1)` and `-1`.
    *   The new expression becomes `(-1) * y**(-1) * (-1/tanh(1)) = 1/(y*tanh(1))`.
    *   So, after this step, `newexpr` is `1/(y*tanh(1))`.

3.  **`if newexpr.has(HyperbolicFunction)`**: The expression `1/(y*tanh(1))` contains `tanh`, so this block is executed.
    *   `e, f = hyper_as_trig(newexpr)`: `tanh(1)` is replaced by `-I*tan(I)`. The expression `e` becomes `1/(y*(-I*tan(I))) = I/(y*tan(I))`. `f` is a function to reverse this substitution.
    *   `res = TR2i(e)`: The simplification routine `TR2i` is called on `I/(y*tan(I))`. A key simplification is `tan(I) = I*tanh(1)`. So, `I/(y*tan(I))` simplifies to `I/(y*I*tanh(1)) = 1/(y*tanh(1))`. So `res` is `1/(y*tanh(1))`.
    *   `newexpr = f(res)`: The reverse substitution function `f` is called on `1/(y*tanh(1))`. `f` looks for `tan` to replace it with `tanh`. Since the expression already contains `tanh` and not `tan`, `f` does nothing.
    *   `newexpr` remains `1/(y*tanh(1))`.

4.  **`if newexpr.has(TrigonometricFunction)`**: The expression `1/(y*tanh(1))` has no trig functions. This block is skipped.

5.  **Return**: The final `newexpr` is `1/(y*tanh(1))`. This does not introduce any new complex numbers. The function returns this value.

This trace successfully produces the desired output from the proposed input. Therefore, the input `expr` is `(exp(2)+1)/(y*(exp(2)-1))`.
