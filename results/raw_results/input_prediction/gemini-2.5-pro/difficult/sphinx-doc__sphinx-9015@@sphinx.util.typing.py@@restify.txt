[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The user wants to find the input for the `restify` function that results in the output `":obj:`tests.test_util_typing.T`"`. The input structure is provided, and I only need to fill in the `XXX` placeholder for `cls.__module__`.

2.  **Analyze the `restify` function:** I'll trace the execution of the `restify` function with a generic input `cls`.
    *   `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:` returns `':obj:`None`'`. This doesn't match.
    *   `elif cls is Ellipsis:` returns `'...'`. This doesn't match.
    *   `elif cls in INVALID_BUILTIN_CLASSES:` returns `':class:`...`'`. The output starts with `:obj:`, not `:class:`. This doesn't match.
    *   `elif inspect.isNewType(cls):` returns `':class:`...`'`. This also doesn't match.
    *   `elif types_Union and isinstance(cls, types_Union):` handles unions, which would likely result in a more complex output string containing `|` or `Optional[...]`. The output is a single type. This path is unlikely.
    *   `elif cls.__module__ in ('__builtin__', 'builtins'):` returns `':class:`...`'`. This doesn't match.

3.  **Conclusion from initial analysis:** None of the visible `if/elif` branches in `restify` produce the desired output. The execution must therefore proceed to one of the helper functions: `_restify_py37(cls)` or `_restify_py36(cls)`. The code for these functions is not provided in the problem description.

4.  **Infer the behavior of helper functions:** I need to deduce what these helper functions do. A common task for a function like `restify` is to handle standard library types specially and then have a general fallback for other user-defined types. The output format `":obj:`module.name`"` is a standard way to represent a type in reStructuredText. A plausible implementation for the fallback case would be something like `return ':obj:`%s.%s`' % (cls.__module__, cls.__qualname__)`.

5.  **Address the tilde (`~`) discrepancy:** Modern versions of Sphinx's `restify` function typically produce `':obj:`~%s.%s`'`, with a tilde (`~`) to shorten the link text in the final output. The given output `":obj:`tests.test_util_typing.T`"` does not have a tilde. This strongly suggests that the code being tested is from an older version of Sphinx (pre-1.8) where the tilde was not yet added. I will proceed with the assumption that the relevant code is `return ':obj:`%s.%s`' % (cls.__module__, cls.__qualname__)`.

6.  **Determine required attributes:** To produce the output `":obj:`tests.test_util_typing.T`"` using the format string `':obj:`%s.%s`'`, the following must be true:
    *   `cls.__module__` must be `'tests.test_util_typing'`.
    *   `cls.__qualname__` must be `'T'`.

7.  **Reconcile with the input structure:** The provided input structure is `{"cls": {"__module__": XXX}}`. This allows me to set `cls.__module__`, but not `cls.__qualname__`. This presents a contradiction. How can the value `'T'` for `__qualname__` be provided?
    *   I must assume something about the test harness that creates the `cls` object. A reasonable assumption is that the harness creates a mock object whose name is inferred, perhaps from the desired output or a fixed convention. If the test harness creates a mock class named `T` (i.e., `class T: pass`), then its `__qualname__` would be `'T'`. The harness would then set the `__module__` attribute on this mock class based on my input.

8.  **Synthesize the final input:**
    *   Assuming the test harness provides `cls.__qualname__ = 'T'`.
    *   And assuming the code path `return ':obj:`%s.%s`' % (cls.__module__, cls.__qualname__)` is taken.
    *   To match the output `":obj:`tests.test_util_typing.T`"`, the value of `cls.__module__` must be `'tests.test_util_typing'`.
    *   Therefore, `XXX` must be `'tests.test_util_typing'`.

9.  **Final Verification:**
    *   Input: `cls` is an object where `cls.__module__ == 'tests.test_util_typing'` and `cls.__qualname__ == 'T'`.
    *   `restify(cls)` is called.
    *   The initial `if/elif` conditions are all false.
    *   `_restify_pyXX(cls)` is called.
    *   The fallback logic `return ':obj:`%s.%s`' % (cls.__module__, cls.__qualname__)` is executed.
    *   The return value is `':obj:`%s.%s`' % ('tests.test_util_typing', 'T')`, which is `":obj:`tests.test_util_typing.T`"`.
    *   This matches the desired output. The reasoning is sound.
