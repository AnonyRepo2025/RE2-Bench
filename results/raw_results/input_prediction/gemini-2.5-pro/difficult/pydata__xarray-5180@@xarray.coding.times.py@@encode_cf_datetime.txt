[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the input for the function `encode_cf_datetime` that results in the output `(10, 'days since 2000-01-01', 'gregorian')`.

**1. Analyze the function signature and output:**
- Function: `encode_cf_datetime(dates, units=None, calendar=None)`
- Output: A tuple `(num, units, calendar)`.
- Given Output: `(10, 'days since 2000-01-01', 'gregorian')`.
- This means `num` must be `10`, `units` must be `'days since 2000-01-01'`, and `calendar` must be `'gregorian'`.

**2. Determine the input for `units` and `calendar`:**
- The function returns the `units` and `calendar` that were used for encoding.
- If `units` were `None`, the function would call `infer_datetime_units`. This function infers the reference date from the first element of the `dates` array. To get `num=10` with a reference date of `2000-01-01`, the date must be `2000-01-11`. If `dates` was `['2000-01-11']`, `infer_datetime_units` would produce units like `'... since 2000-01-11'`, not `'... since 2000-01-01'`. Therefore, the `units` argument must be explicitly provided as `'days since 2000-01-01'`.
- Similarly, if `calendar` were `None`, `infer_calendar_name` would be called. If `dates` is an array of standard Python `datetime` objects (which have `dtype='object'`), the code tries to access `dates.ravel()[0].calendar`. A standard `datetime` object has no `.calendar` attribute, which would cause an `AttributeError`. Therefore, the `calendar` argument must also be explicitly provided as `'gregorian'`.

**3. Determine the input for `dates`:**
- We need to find a `dates` input that, when encoded with `units='days since 2000-01-01'`, produces the number `10`. This means the date must be 10 days after the reference date `2000-01-01`, which is `2000-01-11`.
- Now we need to determine the Python type of the `dates` input. Let's trace the function's logic.
- The function starts with `dates = np.asarray(dates)`.
- It then enters a `try` block containing the condition: `if not _is_standard_calendar(calendar) or dates.dtype.kind == 'O': raise OutOfBoundsDatetime`.
- The `calendar` is `'gregorian'`, which is a standard calendar, so `_is_standard_calendar` is `True`. The first part of the `or` is `False`.
- The execution path depends on `dates.dtype.kind`.
    - **Path A (numpy `datetime64`):** If `dates` is a `numpy.datetime64` array, its `dtype.kind` would be `'M'`. The `if` condition would be `False`, and the code would proceed within the `try` block. However, this path contains `assert dates.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]'`. It's difficult to guarantee that a generic JSON input like a string `["2000-01-11"]` would be converted to a `datetime64[ns]` array by `np.asarray` before the assertion. `np.asarray(["2000-01-11"])` creates a string array, which would fail the assertion.
    - **Path B (object array):** If `dates` is a standard Python `datetime.datetime` object, `np.asarray` will create a numpy array with `dtype='object'`. In this case, `dates.dtype.kind` is `'O'`. The `if` condition `False or True` becomes `True`, and an `OutOfBoundsDatetime` exception is raised.
- This exception is caught by the `except (OutOfBoundsDatetime, OverflowError):` block.
- Inside the `except` block, `num = _encode_datetime_with_cftime(dates, units, calendar)` is called.
- `_encode_datetime_with_cftime` is designed to handle object arrays of `datetime` or `cftime` objects. It iterates through the dates and uses `cftime.date2num` to perform the conversion.
- `cftime.date2num(datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 11), 'days since 2000-01-01', 'gregorian')` correctly calculates and returns `10.0`.
- The output `num` is a scalar `10`, not an array. This suggests the input `dates` was also a scalar. If `dates` is a scalar `datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 11)`, `np.asarray(dates)` creates a 0-dimensional array. After encoding, `reshape(dates.shape)` will produce a scalar number.
- The scalar `10.0` is then passed to `cast_to_int_if_safe`, which converts it to the integer `10`.
- This matches the first element of the output tuple perfectly.

**4. Final Input Construction:**
- `dates`: A scalar `datetime.datetime` object for the date `2000-01-11`. In JSON, this is best represented by the string `"2000-01-11"`.
- `units`: The string `'days since 2000-01-01'`.
- `calendar`: The string `'gregorian'`.

This set of inputs correctly follows a valid execution path to produce the desired output.
