[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Output:** The output is `["3*t_0 - 5", "2*t_0 - 5"]`. This represents a parameterized integer solution for a system of equations, likely a single Diophantine equation with two variables. Let's call the variables `x` and `y`. The solution is:
    *   `x = 3*t_0 - 5`
    *   `y = 2*t_0 - 5`
    where `t_0` is an integer parameter.

2.  **Analyze the Function `diop_solve`:** The function `diop_solve` takes an equation `eq` as input. It first calls `classify_diop` to determine the type of the equation. The solution format strongly suggests a linear Diophantine equation of the form `a*x + b*y = c`. For this type, `diop_solve` calls the `_diop_linear` solver.

3.  **Reconstruct the Equation from the Solution:** We can eliminate the parameter `t_0` to find the relationship between `x` and `y`.
    *   From the first solution: `t_0 = (x + 5) / 3`
    *   Substitute this into the second solution: `y = 2 * ((x + 5) / 3) - 5`
    *   Multiply by 3 to clear the denominator: `3y = 2 * (x + 5) - 15`
    *   Simplify: `3y = 2x + 10 - 15`
    *   `3y = 2x - 5`
    *   Rearrange into the form `... = 0`: `2x - 3y - 5 = 0`.

4.  **Hypothesize and Verify:** Let's assume the input equation is `eq = 2*x - 3*y - 5`. We need to trace the execution of `diop_solve` to see if it produces the given output.

    *   **`classify_diop(2*x - 3*y - 5)`**:
        *   It identifies the free symbols as `x` and `y`.
        *   It sorts them using `default_sort_key`, which results in `var = [x, y]`.
        *   It determines the type as `'linear'`.
        *   It extracts coefficients: `a = 2` (for `x`), `b = -3` (for `y`), and a constant term of `-5`. The equation is treated as `a*x + b*y + C = 0`, so `c = -C = 5`.

    *   **`_diop_linear` solver**: This solver finds the general solution to `ax + by = c`. The standard formula for the general solution is:
        *   `x = x_0 + (b/g) * t`
        *   `y = y_0 - (a/g) * t`
        where `g = gcd(a, b)` and `(x_0, y_0)` is a particular solution found using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (`igcdex`).

    *   **Applying the formula to `2x - 3y = 5`**:
        *   `a = 2`, `b = -3`, `c = 5`.
        *   `g = gcd(2, -3) = 1`.
        *   We need a particular solution `(x_0, y_0)`. First, solve `2s - 3t = 1`. `igcdex(2, -3)` might return `s = -1, t = -1` (since `2*(-1) - 3*(-1) = 1`).
        *   Multiply by `c/g = 5`: `x_0 = s * 5 = -5`, `y_0 = t * 5 = -5`. A particular solution is `(-5, -5)`.
        *   The general solution is:
            *   `x = -5 + (-3/1) * t = -5 - 3t`
            *   `y = -5 - (2/1) * t = -5 - 2t`

5.  **Reconcile the Discrepancy:** The derived solution `(-5 - 3t, -5 - 2t)` does not match the output `(3*t_0 - 5, 2*t_0 - 5)`. The signs of the parameter coefficients are opposite. While the set of solutions is the same (by substituting `t = -t_0`), the specific form is different. This suggests that either the formula used by SymPy is different, or our initial equation is slightly off (e.g., multiplied by -1).

6.  **Refine the Hypothesis:** Let's try the equation multiplied by -1: `-2x + 3y + 5 = 0`.
    *   This is equivalent to `-2x + 3y = -5`.
    *   **Trace again with the new equation**:
        *   `a = -2`, `b = 3`, `c = -5`.
        *   `g = gcd(-2, 3) = 1`.
        *   Solve `-2s + 3t = 1`. `igcdex(-2, 3)` might return `s = 1, t = 1` (since `-2*(1) + 3*(1) = 1`).
        *   Multiply by `c/g = -5`: `x_0 = s * -5 = -5`, `y_0 = t * -5 = -5`. The particular solution is still `(-5, -5)`.
        *   The general solution is:
            *   `x = x_0 + (b/g) * t = -5 + (3/1) * t = 3t - 5`
            *   `y = y_0 - (a/g) * t = -5 - (-2/1) * t = -5 + 2t = 2t - 5`

7.  **Final Conclusion:** This result, `(3t - 5, 2t - 5)`, perfectly matches the structure of the output (ignoring the parameter subscript, which is a minor implementation detail). Therefore, the input equation must be `-2*x + 3*y + 5`. This will be represented as a string in the JSON input.
