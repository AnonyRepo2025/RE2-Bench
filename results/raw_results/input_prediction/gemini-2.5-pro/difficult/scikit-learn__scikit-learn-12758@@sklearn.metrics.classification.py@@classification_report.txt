1.  **Analyze the Output:** The user has provided a classification report as a formatted string. My goal is to reverse-engineer the `y_true` and `y_pred` arrays that would produce this report.

2.  **Extract Key Metrics from the Report:**
    *   **Classes:** The report lists three classes: 'blue', 'green', and 'red'.
    *   **Support (True Counts):** The 'support' column tells us the number of true instances for each class.
        *   `Support(blue) = 24`
        *   `Support(green) = 31`
        *   `Support(red) = 20`
    *   **Total Samples:** The sum of supports is `24 + 31 + 20 = 75`. This is confirmed by the support value in the average rows.
    *   **Per-Class Metrics (Precision, Recall):**
        *   Blue: P=0.83, R=0.79
        *   Green: P=0.33, R=0.10
        *   Red: P=0.42, R=0.90
    *   **Overall Accuracy:** 0.53

3.  **Calculate True Positives (TPs):** The recall for a class is `TP / Support`. I can use this to find the number of true positives for each class.
    *   `TP(blue) = Recall(blue) * Support(blue) = 0.79 * 24 = 18.96`. Rounding to the nearest integer gives `TP(blue) = 19`.
    *   `TP(green) = Recall(green) * Support(green) = 0.10 * 31 = 3.1`. Rounding gives `TP(green) = 3`.
    *   `TP(red) = Recall(red) * Support(red) = 0.90 * 20 = 18`.

4.  **Verify Accuracy:** The total number of correct predictions is the sum of TPs.
    *   `Total TPs = 19 + 3 + 18 = 40`.
    *   `Accuracy = Total TPs / Total Samples = 40 / 75 = 0.5333...`. This rounds to 0.53, which matches the report. The TP values are likely correct.

5.  **Calculate Predicted Counts:** The precision for a class is `TP / (Total Predicted)`. I can use this to find the total number of predictions for each class.
    *   `Predicted(blue) = TP(blue) / Precision(blue) = 19 / 0.83 ≈ 22.89`. Rounding gives `Predicted(blue) = 23`.
    *   `Predicted(green) = TP(green) / Precision(green) = 3 / 0.33 ≈ 9.09`. Rounding gives `Predicted(green) = 9`.
    *   `Predicted(red) = TP(red) / Precision(red) = 18 / 0.42 ≈ 42.85`. Rounding gives `Predicted(red) = 43`.
    *   **Verification:** The sum of predicted counts is `23 + 9 + 43 = 75`, which matches the total number of samples.

6.  **Construct the Confusion Matrix:** Now I have the diagonal elements (TPs) and the row/column sums. I can set up a system of equations to find the off-diagonal elements (the misclassifications).

    Let the matrix be `C`, where `C[i, j]` is the count of true label `i` predicted as `j`.
    Labels: (blue, green, red)

    |           | pred_blue | pred_green | pred_red | Total (True) |
    |-----------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|
    | true_blue |    19     |   C(b,g)   |   C(b,r) |      24      |
    | true_green|   C(g,b)  |      3     |   C(g,r) |      31      |
    | true_red  |   C(r,b)  |   C(r,g)   |    18    |      20      |
    |-----------|-----------|------------|----------|--------------|
    | Total(Pred)|    23     |      9     |    43    |      75      |

    Solving the system of linear equations for the unknown `C` values yields a unique integer solution:
    *   `C(b,g) = 5`, `C(b,r) = 0`
    *   `C(g,b) = 3`, `C(g,r) = 25`
    *   `C(r,b) = 1`, `C(r,g) = 1`

    The final confusion matrix is:
    |           | pred_blue | pred_green | pred_red |
    |-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
    | true_blue |    19     |      5     |     0    |
    | true_green|     3     |      3     |    25    |
    | true_red  |     1     |      1     |    18    |

7.  **Construct `y_true` and `y_pred`:** Based on the confusion matrix, I can construct the input arrays. The order of elements doesn't matter, as long as the pairing between `y_true[i]` and `y_pred[i]` is maintained across the arrays.

    *   19 samples are `(true='blue', pred='blue')`
    *   5 samples are `(true='blue', pred='green')`
    *   3 samples are `(true='green', pred='blue')`
    *   3 samples are `(true='green', pred='green')`
    *   25 samples are `(true='green', pred='red')`
    *   1 sample is `(true='red', pred='blue')`
    *   1 sample is `(true='red', pred='green')`
    *   18 samples are `(true='red', pred='red')`

    I will build the `y_true` and `y_pred` lists by concatenating these pairs.

8.  **Final Input:** The `kwargs` will be empty as the report seems to be generated with default parameters (`digits=2`, `output_dict=False`, etc.). The input will consist of the two generated lists for `y_true` and `y_pred`.
