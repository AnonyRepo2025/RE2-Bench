[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Target Output:** The desired output is the string `"test_util_typing.\"<MyClass2>\""`.

2.  **Analyze the Function `_stringify_py37`:** The function takes an `annotation` object and returns a string representation. It has a series of `if/elif/else` blocks to determine how to stringify the annotation.

3.  **Evaluate Execution Paths:**
    *   **Path 1: `if module == 'typing':`**: This block handles types from the `typing` module. It sets `qualname` from attributes like `_name`, `__qualname__`, or `__forward_arg__`. To produce the output, one of these attributes would need to contain the full string `test_util_typing."<MyClass2>"`. This would also require `annotation.__module__` to be `'typing'`. The provided input `STRUCTURE` for `annotation` only has `__module__` and `__doc__`, so we cannot set `_name`, `__qualname__`, or `__forward_arg__`. This path seems blocked by the input structure's limitations.

    *   **Path 2: `elif hasattr(annotation, '__qualname__'):`**: This block constructs the string as `'%s.%s' % (module, annotation.__qualname__)`. This is a very promising path, as it naturally combines a module name and a qualified name with a dot, matching the output's format. To produce the output, we would need `module` to be `"test_util_typing"` (so `annotation.__module__` is `"test_util_typing"`) and `annotation.__qualname__` to be `"<MyClass2>"`. However, the input `STRUCTURE` does not include a `__qualname__` field, and the problem states we cannot change the structure. This path is also blocked.

    *   **Path 3: `elif hasattr(annotation, '__origin__'):`**: This block recursively calls `stringify(annotation.__origin__)`. To work, `annotation.__origin__` would likely need to be the target string itself. Again, the input `STRUCTURE` does not have an `__origin__` field. This path is blocked.

    *   **Path 4: `else: return repr(annotation)`**: This is the final fallback path. It is taken if the `annotation` object does not have `__qualname__` or `__origin__` (and its module is not `'typing'`). This path is compatible with the provided input `STRUCTURE`, which only defines `__module__` and `__doc__`. For this path to work, the result of `repr(annotation)` must be exactly the target string: `test_util_typing."<MyClass2>"`.

4.  **Synthesize the Input:**
    *   We must follow Path 4. This means we need to construct an `annotation` object from the given structure such that its `repr()` is `test_util_typing."<MyClass2>"`.
    *   The `annotation` object is built from the JSON `{ "__module__": XXX, "__doc__": XXX }`. We can't define a custom `__repr__` method in JSON. Therefore, we must assume that the environment in which this code is run will instantiate a special kind of object from this JSON, an object whose class has a custom `__repr__` method.
    *   Let's hypothesize what this `__repr__` method might do. A plausible implementation would be to combine the attributes it's given. To get `test_util_typing."<MyClass2>"`, it could be combining `__module__` and `__doc__` with a dot. For instance: `def __repr__(self): return f'{self.__module__}.{self.__doc__}'`.
    *   Working with this hypothesis, we can determine the values for `XXX`:
        *   To get the part before the dot, `self.__module__` must be `"test_util_typing"`.
        *   To get the part after the dot, `self.__doc__` must be `"<MyClass2>"`.

5.  **Final Input Construction:** Based on this reasoning, we can fill the placeholders in the structure.

    *   `annotation.__module__` = `"test_util_typing"`
    *   `annotation.__doc__` = `"<MyClass2>"`

This is the only viable path that respects the rigid constraints of the problem, assuming a custom `__repr__` implementation in the execution environment.
