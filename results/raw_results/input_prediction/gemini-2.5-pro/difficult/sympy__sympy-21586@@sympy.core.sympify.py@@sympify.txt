[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Output:** The user has provided the output `{"_args_set": "{'2.00000000000000', '3'}"}`. This output format suggests that the `sympify` function returned a SymPy expression object. The `_args_set` attribute of a SymPy expression contains a set of its arguments. The string representation of this set is what's given in the output.

2.  **Deconstruct the Output:** The set contains two string elements: `'2.00000000000000'` and `'3'`. These correspond to the string representations of a SymPy `Float` object and a SymPy `Integer` object, respectively. Specifically, `str(sympy.Float(2.0))` yields `'2.00000000000000'`, and `str(sympy.Integer(3))` yields `'3'`. Therefore, the returned object is a SymPy expression whose arguments are the integer `3` and the float `2.0`.

3.  **Trace the `sympify` function:** The `sympify` function is a versatile converter that handles many input types. I need to find an input `a` that results in an expression with arguments `{Integer(3), Float(2.0)}`.
    *   If `a` is an iterable like `[3, 2.0]`, the function will recursively call `sympify` on each element, returning a list `[Integer(3), Float(2.0)]`. A list does not have an `_args_set` attribute, so this is incorrect.
    *   If `a` is a numeric type, it will be converted to a single SymPy number, not an expression with multiple arguments.
    *   A crucial part of the `sympify` function is its fallback mechanism: if the input is not recognized as another type, it is converted to a string and parsed using `parse_expr`.

4.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** The most direct way to create a SymPy expression like `Add(3, 2.0)` or `Mul(3, 2.0)` is to provide a string that can be parsed into such an expression. Let's hypothesize that the input `a` is the string `"3 + 2.0"`.

5.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**
    *   The input `a` is `"3 + 2.0"`.
    *   The `sympify` function will eventually reach the string parsing logic at the end.
    *   `parse_expr("3 + 2.0")` is called.
    *   This parser will create a SymPy `Add` object representing the sum.
    *   The arguments of this `Add` object will be `sympy.Integer(3)` and `sympy.Float('2.0')`.
    *   The `_args_set` attribute of this object will be `{Integer(3), Float('2.0')}`.
    *   When the elements of this set are converted to strings, we get `{'3', '2.00000000000000'}`.
    *   The string representation of this set is either `"{'3', '2.00000000000000'}"` or `"{'2.00000000000000', '3'}"`, which matches the provided output.

6.  **Conclusion:** The input `a` must be a string that evaluates to an expression with arguments 3 and 2.0. The simplest such string is `"3 + 2.0"`. Other strings like `"3 * 2.0"` or `"f(3, 2.0)"` would also work, but `"3 + 2.0"` is a canonical and simple choice. I will use this for the input. The `kwargs` are empty, so the default values are used, which is fine for this case.
