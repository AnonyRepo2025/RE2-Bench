[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Target Output:** The user wants the function `_expand_partial_derivative` to return an object whose `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` attributes are `null`. The output is a JSON representation of a Python object. In Python, this corresponds to these attributes being `None`.

2.  **Examine the Function's Return Value:** The function `_expand_partial_derivative` returns the `result` variable. Let's trace how `result` is assigned.
    *   It's initialized as `result = obj`. The `obj` is a `PartialDerivative` instance whose attributes (`_indices`, etc.) are copied from the calculation in `_contract_indices_for_derivative`. These are typically lists (`[]`), not `None`.
    *   The `if not args[0].free_symbols:` branch returns `S.Zero`, which is not the right type of object.
    *   The `elif isinstance(obj.expr, TensAdd):` branch reassigns `result`. It returns a new `TensAdd` object created by `obj.expr.func(...)`.
    *   The `elif isinstance(obj.expr, TensMul):` branch (with one variable) also reassigns `result` to a new `TensAdd` object created by `TensAdd.fromiter(...)`.
    *   The `else` branch for `TensMul` is recursive, and its final return value will depend on the base case of the recursion, which will likely be one of the other branches.

3.  **Identify the Key Code Path:** The most direct way to get an object with `_indices = None`, `_free = None`, `_dum = None` is to create a new `TensExpr` without explicitly setting these attributes. The `TensExpr.__new__` method initializes these attributes to `None`. Both the `TensAdd` and `TensMul` (with one variable) branches create a new `TensAdd` object. This new object will have its `_indices`, `_free`, and `_dum` attributes set to `None` by the `TensExpr` base class constructor. This matches the desired output.

4.  **Determine the Condition for the Key Path:** To enter either of these branches, the expression being differentiated, `self.expr` (which is `self.args[0]`), must be an instance of `TensAdd` or `TensMul`.

5.  **Determine the State of the Input `self`:** The problem asks for the attributes of the input object `self`. These attributes (`_indices`, `_free`, `_dum`) are set when the `self` object (an instance of `PartialDerivative`) is created. The `PartialDerivative.__new__` method is responsible for this. It calls `_contract_indices_for_derivative(self.expr, self.variables)`.

6.  **Simulate `self`'s Creation:** Let's assume the simplest case that triggers the required code path: `self.expr` is a `TensAdd` of two scalar tensors (tensors with no indices), and it's differentiated with respect to a scalar symbol.
    *   Let `expr = Tensor('A') + Tensor('B')`. This is a `TensAdd` instance.
    *   Let `variables = (Symbol('x'),)`.
    *   When `PartialDerivative(expr, *variables)` is called to create `self`, it internally calls `_contract_indices_for_derivative`.
    *   This function calls `TensMul._tensMul_contract_indices` on a list containing the expression and the variable.
    *   The function `get_indices` is called on the `TensAdd` expression and the `Symbol`. For scalar expressions and symbols, `get_indices` returns an empty tuple `()`.
    *   Since the list of indices is empty, `_tensMul_contract_indices` finds no free or dummy indices. It returns empty lists `[]` for `indices`, `free`, and `dum`.
    *   These empty lists are then assigned to `self._indices`, `self._free`, and `self._dum`.

7.  **Final Prediction:** The input `self` object, when `_expand_partial_derivative` is called on it, must have been created from an expression that is a `TensAdd` or `TensMul`. The simplest such case (using scalar components) results in `self._indices`, `self._free`, and `self._dum` all being empty lists `[]`. This is the predicted input. When this `self` is passed to `_expand_partial_derivative`, the function will create and return a *new* `TensAdd` object whose attributes are `None`, matching the output.
