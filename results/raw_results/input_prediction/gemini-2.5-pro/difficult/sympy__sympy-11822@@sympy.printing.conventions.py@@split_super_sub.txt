[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the input `text` for the function `split_super_sub` that results in the output `("alpha", ["+"], ["1"])`.

Let's analyze the function `split_super_sub(text)`:
1.  It iterates through the input string `text`, splitting it into parts based on the characters `_` and `^`.
2.  The first part is assigned to the `name` variable.
3.  Subsequent parts starting with `^` or `__` have their content (after the prefix) appended to the `supers` list.
4.  Subsequent parts starting with `_` have their content (after the `_`) appended to the `subs` list.
5.  After the loop, there's a special check: `m = _name_with_digits_p.match(name)`. This regex `^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$` checks if the `name` variable ends with digits.
6.  If it matches, the `name` is split into the alphabetic part and the numeric part. The numeric part is then inserted at the beginning of the `subs` list.
7.  Finally, it returns a tuple `(name, supers, subs)`.

Now let's work backward from the desired output: `("alpha", ["+"], ["1"])`.

*   **`name` is "alpha"**: The final name is "alpha".
*   **`supers` is `["+"]`**: This means a part of the input string must have been `^+` or `__+`. Let's assume `^+` for simplicity.
*   **`subs` is `["1"]`**: This is the key. The value "1" could have come from two places:
    1.  A part of the input string was `_1`.
    2.  The initial `name` matched the regex, and the digit `1` was extracted from it.

Let's explore the second possibility, as it involves the special logic at the end of the function.

If the `1` in `subs` came from the regex match, it means:
1.  The `name` variable, as extracted from the main loop, must have been something like `"alpha1"`.
2.  The regex `_name_with_digits_p.match("alpha1")` would succeed.
3.  `m.groups()` would return `("alpha", "1")`.
4.  The `name` variable would be updated to `"alpha"`.
5.  The `sub` variable would be `"1"`.
6.  `subs.insert(0, "1")` would make the `subs` list `["1"]`.

This perfectly explains how `name` becomes "alpha" and `subs` becomes `["1"]`.

So, we need to construct an input `text` where:
*   The first part parsed is `"alpha1"`.
*   Another part parsed is `^+`.

Let's combine these: `text = "alpha1^+"`.

Let's trace the execution with `text = "alpha1^+"`:
1.  The `while` loop starts.
2.  **First iteration**: The code finds the next `^` or `_` at index 6. The first part is `text[0:6]`, which is `"alpha1"`. This is assigned to `name`. `pos` becomes 6.
3.  **Second iteration**: The rest of the string is `text[6:]`, which is `"^+"`. This part starts with `^`, so `"+"` is appended to the `supers` list. `pos` becomes 8.
4.  The loop ends.
5.  At this point, `name` is `"alpha1"`, `supers` is `["+"]`, and `subs` is `[]`.
6.  The code checks `_name_with_digits_p.match("alpha1")`. It's a match.
7.  `name` is updated to `"alpha"`.
8.  `"1"` is inserted into `subs`, making it `["1"]`.
9.  The function returns `("alpha", ["+"], ["1"])`.

This matches the desired output. Therefore, the input `text` must be `"alpha1^+"`.
