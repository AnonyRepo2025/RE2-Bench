1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The user wants to find the input `n` for the given Python script that produces the output `719476260`.

2.  **Analyze the Python Code:**
    *   The script reads an integer `n` from the input.
    *   It defines a function `ok(last4)` which is supposed to check if a 4-character string is "valid".
    *   It defines a recursive function `dfs(cur, last3)` with memoization, which counts the number of valid strings of length `n`.
    *   The main part of the script calls `dfs(0, 'TTT')` and prints the result.

3.  **Step-by-step simulation and reasoning:**
    *   Let's look closely at the `ok(last4)` function. It iterates four times. In each iteration, it creates a list `t` from the input string `last4`, potentially swaps two adjacent characters, and then checks a condition: `if ' '.join(t).count('AGC') >= 1:`.
    *   The key part is `' '.join(t)`. If `t` is `['A', 'G', 'C', 'T']`, `' '.join(t)` results in the string `'A G C T'`.
    *   The condition then checks `.count('AGC')` on this space-separated string. The substring `'AGC'` will never be found in a string like `'A G C T'` because of the spaces.
    *   This means the condition `' '.join(t).count('AGC') >= 1` is *always* false.
    *   Consequently, the `ok(last4)` function will never return `False` inside the loop. It will always complete the loop and `return True`.

4.  **Simplify the `dfs` function based on the analysis of `ok`:**
    *   Since `ok(last3 + c)` always returns `True`, the `if` condition in the `dfs` function is always met.
    *   The `dfs` function's logic simplifies to this: for any state `(cur, last3)` where `cur < n`, it will make a recursive call for each of the 4 characters in `'ACGT'`.
    *   `dfs(cur, ...)` effectively becomes `(4 * dfs(cur + 1, ...)) % mod`.
    *   The base case is `dfs(n, ...)`, which returns 1.
    *   Therefore, `dfs(0, 'TTT')` will compute `4 * dfs(1, ...)` which is `4 * (4 * dfs(2, ...))`, and so on.
    *   The final result is `4^n % mod`.

5.  **Solve for `n`:**
    *   The problem is now to find `n` such that `4^n % (10^9 + 7) == 719476260`.
    *   Let `mod = 10**9 + 7 = 1000000007`.
    *   Let's calculate the powers of 4 modulo `mod` for increasing `n`.
    *   `n = 1`: `4^1 % mod = 4`
    *   `n = 2`: `4^2 % mod = 16`
    *   `n = 3`: `4^3 % mod = 64`
    *   ...
    *   `n = 10`: `4^10 % mod = 1048576`
    *   `n = 15`: `4^15 % mod = 1073741824 % 1000000007 = 73741817`
    *   `n = 16`: `(73741817 * 4) % mod = 294967268`
    *   `n = 17`: `(294967268 * 4) % mod = 1179869072 % 1000000007 = 179869065`
    *   `n = 18`: `(179869065 * 4) % mod = 719476260`.
    *   This matches the target output.

6.  **Conclusion:** The input `n` must be 18. The complex structure of the code is misleading due to a bug/typo in the `ok` function, which makes it a simple modular exponentiation problem.
