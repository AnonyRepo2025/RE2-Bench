[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find an input `st` for the function `f` that produces the output `"Hey"`.

Let's analyze the code of the function `f(st)`:
```python
def f(st):
    if st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i')) >= st.lower().rindex('i'):
        return 'Hey'
    else:
        return 'Hi'
```

1.  The function's behavior depends on the result of the `if` condition.
2.  The output is `"Hey"`, which means the condition must evaluate to `True`.
3.  Let's break down the condition: `st.lower().rindex('h', st.lower().rindex('i')) >= st.lower().rindex('i')`.

Let's use a helper variable `s = st.lower()` to simplify the expression.
The condition is `s.rindex('h', s.rindex('i')) >= s.rindex('i')`.

Let's analyze the parts of this expression:
-   `s.rindex('i')`: This finds the index of the last occurrence of the character 'i' in the string `s`. If 'i' is not found, it raises a `ValueError`. Let's call this index `i_pos`.
-   `s.rindex('h', i_pos)`: This finds the index of the last occurrence of 'h' in `s`, but the search is restricted to the slice of the string starting from index `i_pos` to the end (i.e., `s[i_pos:]`). If 'h' is not found in this slice, it raises a `ValueError`. Let's call the result `h_pos`.

Now let's look at the comparison: `h_pos >= i_pos`.
If the expression `s.rindex('h', i_pos)` successfully finds an 'h' and returns its index `h_pos`, this 'h' must have been found in the part of the string `s[i_pos:]`. By definition, the index of any character in this slice must be greater than or equal to `i_pos`. Therefore, if the code does not raise an exception, `h_pos` will always be greater than or equal to `i_pos`.

This means the condition `h_pos >= i_pos` is always `True` as long as the program doesn't crash with a `ValueError`. Consequently, the `else` block that returns `'Hi'` is unreachable. The function can only do two things: return `'Hey'` or raise a `ValueError`.

Since the desired output is `"Hey"`, we need to find an input `st` that does not cause a `ValueError`.
To avoid a `ValueError`, the input string `st` must satisfy two conditions (case-insensitively):
1.  It must contain the character 'i' (so that `s.rindex('i')` succeeds).
2.  It must contain the character 'h' at an index greater than or equal to the index of the last 'i' (so that `s.rindex('h', i_pos)` succeeds).

Let's construct a simple string that meets these criteria.
-   We need an 'i'.
-   We need an 'h' to appear after (or at the same time as, which is impossible) the last 'i'.
-   The string `"ih"` is a good candidate.

Let's trace `st = "ih"`:
1.  `s = st.lower()` becomes `"ih"`.
2.  `i_pos = s.rindex('i')` evaluates to `0`.
3.  The expression becomes `s.rindex('h', 0) >= 0`.
4.  `s.rindex('h', 0)` searches for 'h' in `"ih"` starting from index 0. It finds 'h' at index `1`.
5.  The condition becomes `1 >= 0`, which is `True`.
6.  The function returns `'Hey'`.

This confirms that `st = "ih"` is a valid input.
