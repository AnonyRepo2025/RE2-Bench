[THOUGHT]
1.  **Analyze the Python code:**
    *   The code first reads an integer `n` from the input: `n = int(input())`.
    *   It initializes two variables: `i` to `1` and `j` to `n * n`.
    *   It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than `j`.
    *   Inside the loop, it prints the current values of `i` and `j`, separated by a space.
    *   Then, it increments `i` by 1 (`i += 1`) and decrements `j` by 1 (`j -= 1`).

2.  **Analyze the output:**
    *   The output consists of multiple lines.
    *   The very first line is `1 100`.

3.  **Connect the code to the output:**
    *   The first line of output is generated by the first `print(i, j)` statement inside the loop.
    *   On the first iteration, `i` is `1`. This matches the first number on the first line of the output.
    *   On the first iteration, `j` is `n * n`. The second number on the first line of the output is `100`.
    *   Therefore, we can deduce that `n * n` must be equal to `100`.

4.  **Solve for the input `n`:**
    *   We have the equation: `n * n = 100`.
    *   Taking the square root of both sides gives `n = 10` (since `n` is an integer from `int(input())`, we take the positive root).
    *   So, the input value for `n` must be `10`.

5.  **Verify the result:**
    *   If `n = 10`, then `i` starts at `1` and `j` starts at `10 * 10 = 100`.
    *   The loop condition is `while i < j`.
    *   **Iteration 1:** `i=1`, `j=100`. `1 < 100` is true. Print `1 100`. `i` becomes 2, `j` becomes 99.
    *   **Iteration 2:** `i=2`, `j=99`. `2 < 99` is true. Print `2 99`. `i` becomes 3, `j` becomes 98.
    *   ...
    *   **Last iteration:** Let's look at the last line of the output: `50 51`. This means the loop ran when `i` was `50` and `j` was `51`.
    *   Is `50 < 51`? Yes, it's true. So, `50 51` is printed.
    *   After this print, `i` becomes `51` and `j` becomes `50`.
    *   **Next check:** The loop condition `i < j` becomes `51 < 50`, which is false. The loop terminates.
    *   The entire execution with `n = 10` perfectly matches the provided output.

6.  **Format the final input:**
    *   The input is a single integer `10`.
    *   The structure is `{"input": XXX}`.
    *   The value of `XXX` should be the string representation of the input, which is `"10"`.
