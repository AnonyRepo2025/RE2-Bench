[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the inputs `text`, `s`, and `e` for the function `f` that result in the output `1`.

Let's analyze the function `f(text, s, e)`:
1.  `sublist = text[s:e]`: It creates a sublist by slicing the input list `text` from index `s` to `e-1`.
2.  `if not sublist: return -1`: It checks if the sublist is empty. Since the output is `1`, not `-1`, the sublist must not be empty.
3.  `return sublist.index(min(sublist))`: This is the line that produces the output. It finds the minimum element in `sublist` and then returns the index of that minimum element *within the sublist*.

The output is `1`. This means `sublist.index(min(sublist))` must be equal to `1`.
This tells us that the minimum element of the `sublist` is located at index `1` of the `sublist` itself.

So, I need to construct a `sublist` that satisfies this condition.
A simple example would be a list where the first element is larger than the second element.
Let's try `sublist = [10, 5]`.
- `min(sublist)` is `5`.
- `sublist.index(5)` is `1`.
This works.

Now I need to find `text`, `s`, and `e` such that `text[s:e]` equals `[10, 5]`.
There are many possibilities. I will choose the simplest one.

Let `text` be the same as the `sublist`.
- `text = [10, 5]`
- To get the whole list, the slice must start at index `0` and end at the length of the list, which is `2`.
- So, `s = 0` and `e = 2`.

Let's verify this set of inputs:
- `text = [10, 5]`
- `s = 0`
- `e = 2`
- `sublist = text[0:2]` which is `[10, 5]`.
- `sublist` is not empty.
- `min(sublist)` is `min([10, 5])`, which is `5`.
- `sublist.index(5)` is `1`.
- The function returns `1`.

This matches the desired output. So, a valid input is `text = [10, 5]`, `s = 0`, `e = 2`.
Another simple example for `sublist` could be `[2, 1, 3]`.
- `min([2, 1, 3])` is `1`.
- `[2, 1, 3].index(1)` is `1`.
If we use this `sublist`, we could have:
- `text = [2, 1, 3]`
- `s = 0`
- `e = 3`
This is also a valid solution. I will use the first one as it is slightly simpler.
