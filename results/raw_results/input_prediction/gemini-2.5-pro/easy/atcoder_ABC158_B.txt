The user wants me to find the input for a given Python script that results in the output `0`.

**1. Analyze the Python script:**
The script takes three space-separated integers as input: `N`, `A`, and `B`.
It then calculates a value `ans` based on these inputs and prints it.
The calculation is as follows:
- `ans = N // (A + B) * A`: This calculates the number of full cycles of `(A+B)` that fit into `N`, and for each cycle, it adds `A` to `ans`.
- `rem = N % (A + B)`: This calculates the remainder.
- `ans += min(rem, A)`: It adds the smaller value between the remainder and `A`. This handles the partial cycle at the end.
The final formula for `ans` is `(N // (A + B) * A) + min(N % (A + B), A)`.

**2. Analyze the desired output:**
The desired output is `0`. This means the final value of `ans` must be `0`.

**3. Reverse-engineer the input:**
We need to find values for `N`, `A`, and `B` such that `(N // (A + B) * A) + min(N % (A + B), A) = 0`.

Let's assume `N`, `A`, and `B` are non-negative integers, which is standard for this type of problem. This means both terms in the sum are non-negative.
For a sum of non-negative terms to be zero, each term must be zero.
So, we need to satisfy two conditions simultaneously:
1.  `N // (A + B) * A = 0`
2.  `min(N % (A + B), A) = 0`

Let's analyze these conditions:

**Condition 1: `N // (A + B) * A = 0`**
This equation is true if either:
- `A = 0`
- or `N // (A + B) = 0`, which implies `N < A + B`.

**Condition 2: `min(N % (A + B), A) = 0`**
This equation is true if either:
- `A = 0`
- or `N % (A + B) = 0`.

Now let's combine the possibilities to find a valid solution.

**Case 1: Let's assume `A = 0`.**
- If `A = 0`, Condition 1 (`... * 0 = 0`) is met.
- If `A = 0`, Condition 2 (`min(..., 0) = 0`) is met.
So, any input where `A = 0` will result in `ans = 0`. We must ensure `A + B > 0` to avoid division by zero, so `B` must be positive.
Example: `N=8, A=0, B=3`.
- `ans = 8 // (0 + 3) * 0 = 2 * 0 = 0`
- `rem = 8 % (0 + 3) = 2`
- `ans += min(2, 0) = 0`
- Final `ans` is `0`. This works.

**Case 2: Let's assume `A > 0`.**
- For Condition 1 to be met, we must have `N < A + B`.
- For Condition 2 to be met, we must have `N % (A + B) = 0`.
The only non-negative integer `N` that satisfies both `N < A + B` and `N % (A + B) = 0` is `N = 0`.
So, if `A > 0`, we must have `N = 0`.
Example: `N=0, A=5, B=10`.
- `ans = 0 // (5 + 10) * 5 = 0 * 5 = 0`
- `rem = 0 % (5 + 10) = 0`
- `ans += min(0, 5) = 0`
- Final `ans` is `0`. This also works.

**Conclusion:**
The output will be `0` if either `A = 0` or `N = 0` (assuming `A+B > 0`).

I can choose any simple input that satisfies one of these conditions. I will choose an input from Case 2, where `N=0`.
Let's pick `N=0, A=1, B=1`.
- Input string: `"0 1 1"`
- `N=0, A=1, B=1`
- `ans = 0 // (1 + 1) * 1 = 0`
- `rem = 0 % (1 + 1) = 0`
- `ans += min(0, 1) = 0`
- Final `ans` is `0`. This is a valid input.
