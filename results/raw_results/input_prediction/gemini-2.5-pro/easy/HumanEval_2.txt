[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the input for the Python function `truncate_number`.

**Function:**
```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    return number % 1.0
```

**Output:**
```json
{
    "output": 0.5
}
```

**Analysis:**
1.  The function `truncate_number` takes a single float argument named `number`.
2.  It performs the operation `number % 1.0`.
3.  The modulo operator (`%`) with `1.0` as the divisor effectively isolates the fractional part of the `number`. For a positive number `x`, `x % 1.0` gives the part of `x` after the decimal point. For example, `3.14 % 1.0` results in `0.14`.
4.  The desired output is `0.5`.
5.  Therefore, I need to find an input `number` such that `number % 1.0` equals `0.5`.
6.  This means the fractional part of the input `number` must be `0.5`.
7.  The integer part of the number can be any integer.
8.  Let's test a few possibilities:
    *   If `number` is `0.5`, then `0.5 % 1.0` is `0.5`. This is a valid input.
    *   If `number` is `1.5`, then `1.5 % 1.0` is `0.5`. This is also a valid input.
    *   If `number` is `10.5`, then `10.5 % 1.0` is `0.5`. This is also a valid input.
    *   If `number` is `-1.5`, then `-1.5 % 1.0` is `0.5` (in Python, the sign of the result of the modulo operator matches the sign of the divisor, so `-1.5 = -2 * 1.0 + 0.5`). This is also a valid input.
9.  I can choose any of these valid inputs. A simple and clear example is `1.5`. I will use that for the final answer.
