[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the inputs `s` and `ch` for the function `f` that result in the output `"ff"`.

Let's analyze the execution flow of the function `f(s, ch)`:

1.  The function starts by assigning `sl = s`.
2.  It then checks `if ch in s:`.
    *   If this condition is false, the function returns `'no'`. Since the output is `"ff"`, this condition must be `True`. So, the character `ch` must be present in the string `s`.
3.  If `ch` is in `s`, the code proceeds to `sl = s.lstrip(ch)`. This line removes all leading occurrences of the character `ch` from the string `s` and assigns the result to `sl`.
4.  Next, it checks `if len(sl) == 0:`.
    *   This would be true if the string `s` consisted *only* of the character `ch`.
    *   If true, `sl` would become `'!?'` and the function would return that.
    *   Since the output is `"ff"`, this condition must be `False`. This means that after stripping the leading `ch` characters, the resulting string `sl` is not empty.
5.  Finally, the function returns the value of `sl`.

From the analysis, we know the following:
*   The final returned value is `sl`.
*   The desired output is `"ff"`. Therefore, the value of `sl` at the end of the function must be `"ff"`.
*   This value of `sl` is the result of the operation `s.lstrip(ch)`. So, `s.lstrip(ch)` must equal `"ff"`.
*   The condition `ch in s` must be true.

The statement `s.lstrip(ch) == "ff"` implies that the string `s` is composed of some number of leading `ch` characters followed by the substring `"ff"`.
So, `s` must look like `(ch...ch)ff`.

For the condition `ch in s` to be true, there must be at least one `ch` character at the beginning of `s`.

Let's consider a simple case. Let's assume there is one leading `ch` character.
Let's pick a character for `ch`, for example, `'a'`.
If `ch = 'a'`, then `s` would be `'a' + "ff"`, which is `"aff"`.

Let's trace the function with these inputs: `s = "aff"` and `ch = "a"`.
1.  `sl = "aff"`.
2.  `if "a" in "aff":` -> This is `True`.
3.  `sl = "aff".lstrip("a")` -> `sl` becomes `"ff"`.
4.  `if len("ff") == 0:` -> `if 2 == 0:` -> This is `False`.
5.  The function proceeds to the end and returns `sl`, which is `"ff"`.

This matches the desired output. Therefore, `s = "aff"` and `ch = "a"` is a valid input.

What if `ch` was `'f'`?
Let's try `s = "fff"` and `ch = "f"`.
1. `sl = "fff"`.
2. `if "f" in "fff":` -> True.
3. `sl = "fff".lstrip("f")` -> `sl` becomes `""` (an empty string).
4. `if len("") == 0:` -> True.
5. `sl = sl + '!?'` -> `sl` becomes `"!?"`.
6. The function would return `"!?"`, which is not the desired output.
So, `ch` cannot be `'f'`.

The simplest solution is `s = "aff"` and `ch = "a"`. Any character other than 'f' for `ch` would work, as long as `s` starts with at least one of that character followed by "ff".
I will use `s = "aff"` and `ch = "a"`.
