[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the inputs `nums` and `index` for the function `f` that result in the output `9`.

The function is defined as:
```python
def f(nums, index):
    return nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2
```

Let's analyze the return statement: `nums[index] % 42 + nums.pop(index) * 2`.

In Python, expressions are generally evaluated from left to right. The arguments to the `+` operator are evaluated before the addition is performed.
1.  The left-hand side `nums[index] % 42` is evaluated first.
2.  The right-hand side `nums.pop(index) * 2` is evaluated second.

The key observation is that `nums.pop(index)` modifies the list `nums`. However, the value at `nums[index]` is accessed for the left-hand side *before* the list is modified by `pop`. The `pop` method then removes and returns that same value.

Let's define `val = nums[index]`.
The expression can be broken down as follows:
1.  `nums[index]` is evaluated, which gives `val`.
2.  `val % 42` is calculated.
3.  `nums.pop(index)` is called. This removes the element at `index` from `nums` and returns its value, which is also `val`.
4.  `val * 2` is calculated.
5.  The two results are added together.

So, the equation we need to solve is:
`(val % 42) + (val * 2) = 9`

We need to find an integer `val` that satisfies this equation.

Let's test some small non-negative integer values for `val`:
- If `val = 0`: `0 % 42 + 2 * 0 = 0 + 0 = 0`
- If `val = 1`: `1 % 42 + 2 * 1 = 1 + 2 = 3`
- If `val = 2`: `2 % 42 + 2 * 2 = 2 + 4 = 6`
- If `val = 3`: `3 % 42 + 2 * 3 = 3 + 6 = 9`. This is a solution!

So, `val` can be `3`. This means `nums[index]` must be `3`.

To construct the input, we can choose the simplest possible list and index.
- Let `index = 0`.
- Then `nums` must be a list where the element at index 0 is 3. The simplest such list is `[3]`.

Let's verify this input: `nums = [3]`, `index = 0`.
- `nums[0] % 42` -> `3 % 42` -> `3`.
- `nums.pop(0)` -> returns `3`, and `nums` becomes `[]`.
- `3 * 2` -> `6`.
- The final result is `3 + 6 = 9`.
This matches the desired output.

We could also search for other solutions. For example, negative numbers.
Let's try `val = -11`:
- `(-11) % 42` in Python is `31`.
- `2 * (-11)` is `-22`.
- `31 + (-22) = 9`. This is also a solution.
So, `nums = [-11]` and `index = 0` would also work.

However, the problem only requires one valid input. The simplest one is `nums = [3]` and `index = 0`. I will use this one.

Final check:
- `nums`: `[3]`
- `index`: `0`
- `nums[index]`: `3`
- `nums[index] % 42`: `3 % 42 = 3`
- `nums.pop(index)`: `nums.pop(0)` returns `3`.
- `nums.pop(index) * 2`: `3 * 2 = 6`
- `return 3 + 6`: `9`.
The logic is sound.
