[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find an input `lst` for the Python function `add` that results in the output `12`.

**1. Analyze the function `add(lst)`:**
   - The function calculates a sum based on the elements of the input list `lst`.
   - The core of the function is a list comprehension: `[lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0]`.
   - Let's break down the list comprehension:
     - `range(1, len(lst), 2)`: This generates a sequence of indices. It starts at index `1`, increments by `2`, and stops before `len(lst)`. This means it only considers the odd indices of the list (1, 3, 5, ...).
     - `if lst[i] % 2 == 0`: For each of these odd indices `i`, it checks if the value of the element `lst[i]` is an even number.
     - `lst[i]`: Only the elements that satisfy the condition (are even and at an odd index) are included in the new list.
   - `sum(...)`: The function then returns the sum of the elements in this newly created list.

**2. Reverse-engineer the input from the output:**
   - The given output is `12`.
   - This means `sum([even numbers at odd indices])` must equal `12`.
   - I need to find a set of even numbers that add up to 12. There are many possibilities:
     - `[12]`
     - `[10, 2]`
     - `[8, 4]`
     - `[6, 6]`
     - `[6, 4, 2]`
     - etc.

**3. Construct a candidate input list `lst`:**
   - Let's choose a simple combination, for example, `[6, 6]`. The sum is `6 + 6 = 12`.
   - This means the list comprehension must produce the list `[6, 6]`.
   - To achieve this, I need to place the number `6` at two different odd indices in the input list `lst`.
   - Let's place the first `6` at index `1` (`lst[1] = 6`).
   - Let's place the second `6` at index `3` (`lst[3] = 6`).
   - The values at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) do not affect the sum. I can fill them with any arbitrary numbers. Let's use `0` for simplicity.
   - So, a possible list is `[0, 6, 0, 6]`.
   - Let's test this list:
     - `lst = [0, 6, 0, 6]`
     - Odd indices are 1 and 3.
     - `lst[1]` is 6, which is even. It will be included.
     - `lst[3]` is 6, which is even. It will be included.
     - The list comprehension generates `[6, 6]`.
     - `sum([6, 6])` is `12`. This works.

**4. Construct another, slightly more complex example to demonstrate all conditions:**
   - Let's use the combination `[8, 4]`. Sum is `8 + 4 = 12`.
   - Place `8` at index 1: `lst[1] = 8`.
   - Place `4` at index 3: `lst[3] = 4`.
   - Let's add an odd number at another odd index to show it gets filtered out. Place `5` at index 5: `lst[5] = 5`.
   - Now, let's fill the even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4) with arbitrary numbers, say `1`, `2`, `3`.
   - The resulting list is `lst = [1, 8, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.
   - Let's trace this list:
     - `lst = [1, 8, 2, 4, 3, 5]`
     - Odd indices to check are 1, 3, 5.
     - `lst[1]` is 8 (even). Include it.
     - `lst[3]` is 4 (even). Include it.
     - `lst[5]` is 5 (odd). Exclude it.
     - The list comprehension generates `[8, 4]`.
     - `sum([8, 4])` is `12`. This also works and is a good example.

I will use the simpler `[0, 6, 0, 6]` for the final answer as it is clear and sufficient.
