[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the input for a given Python script that produces a specific output.

**Code Analysis:**
1.  `a, b = input().split()`: The program takes a single line of input and splits it into two strings, `a` and `b`, using whitespace as a delimiter.
2.  `b = b[0] + b[2:]`: This line modifies the string `b`. It takes the first character of `b` and concatenates it with the substring of `b` starting from the third character. This effectively removes the second character of `b`. This operation suggests that `b` is likely a string representation of a decimal number, like "1.23", and this operation removes the decimal point. For this to work without an error, `b` must have at least 3 characters.
3.  `a = int(a)`: The string `a` is converted to an integer.
4.  `b = int(b)`: The modified string `b` is converted to an integer.
5.  `print(a * b // 100)`: The program calculates the product of the two integers `a` and `b`, then performs integer division by 100, and prints the result.

**Output Analysis:**
The given output is `0`.

**Reverse Engineering:**
The final line of the code tells us that `a * b // 100` must equal `0`.
For integer division `X // Y` to be `0` (assuming `X` and `Y` are positive), `X` must be less than `Y`.
In our case, this means `a * b` must be less than `100`.
So, we need to find an input string `"input_a input_b"` such that:
- `a = int(input_a)`
- `b = int(input_b[0] + input_b[2:])`
- `a * b < 100` (and `a * b >= 0`)

Let's assume `input_b` is a decimal number string like "X.YZ".
- `input_b[0]` would be "X".
- `input_b[2:]` would be "YZ".
- The modified `b` string would be "XYZ".
- The integer `b` would be `int("XYZ")`.
This is equivalent to taking the decimal number and multiplying it by 100. For example, if `input_b` is "1.23", `b` becomes `123`.

So the condition is `int(input_a) * int(input_b_without_decimal_point) < 100`.

Let's find a simple pair of values for `a` and `b` that satisfy this.
A very simple case is if `a * b` is any number from 0 to 99.

**Scenario 1:** Let's pick `a = 10`.
- We need `10 * b < 100`, which means `b < 10`.
- Let's choose `b = 9`.
- To get `b = 9`, the modified `b` string could be "9", "09", "009", etc.
- Let's assume the original `input_b` was "0.09".
- `input_b[0] + input_b[2:]` would be `"0" + "09"`, which is "009".
- `int("009")` is `9`. This works.
- So, a possible input is `input_a = "10"` and `input_b = "0.09"`.
- Let's test the input `"10 0.09"`:
    - `a, b = "10", "0.09"`
    - `b` becomes `"0" + "09"` -> `"009"`
    - `a` becomes `int("10")` -> `10`
    - `b` becomes `int("009")` -> `9`
    - `a * b // 100` is `10 * 9 // 100` -> `90 // 100` -> `0`.
- This input works.

**Scenario 2:** Let's pick `a = 2`.
- We need `2 * b < 100`, which means `b < 50`.
- Let's choose `b = 49`.
- To get `b = 49`, the original `input_b` could be "0.49".
- `input_b[0] + input_b[2:]` would be `"0" + "49"`, which is "049".
- `int("049")` is `49`. This works.
- So, a possible input is `input_a = "2"` and `input_b = "0.49"`.
- Let's test the input `"2 0.49"`:
    - `a, b = "2", "0.49"`
    - `b` becomes `"0" + "49"` -> `"049"`
    - `a` becomes `int("2")` -> `2`
    - `b` becomes `int("049")` -> `49`
    - `a * b // 100` is `2 * 49 // 100` -> `98 // 100` -> `0`.
- This input also works.

I will use the input from Scenario 1 as the final answer. It's a valid input that produces the desired output.
