[THOUGHT]
The user wants me to find the inputs `text` and `chars` for the function `f` that result in the output `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.

Let's analyze the function `f(text, chars)`:
1.  It checks if `chars` is a truthy value (not `None`, not an empty string).
2.  If `chars` is truthy, it executes `text = text.rstrip(chars)`. This removes any trailing characters from `text` that are present in the `chars` string.
3.  If `chars` is falsy, it executes `text = text.rstrip(' ')`. This removes trailing spaces from `text`.
4.  After the stripping operation, it checks if the resulting `text` is an empty string.
5.  If `text` is empty, it returns `'-'`.
6.  Otherwise, it returns the modified `text`.

Now, let's analyze the given output: `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.

1.  The output is not `'-'`, which means the `text` variable was not an empty string after the `rstrip` operation.
2.  The output is the value of `text` after `rstrip`. This implies that the original input `text` must have been the output string followed by some characters that were stripped away.
3.  Let's call the output string `O = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`. The input `text` must be `O + S`, where `S` is a string of characters that were stripped.

We need to find a pair of `text` and `chars` that satisfies the function's logic. There are two main paths through the function.

**Path 1: `if chars:` is true.**
- In this case, `text.rstrip(chars)` must equal `O`.
- This means the string `S` (the stripped part) must consist only of characters found in `chars`.
- The `rstrip` operation stops at the first character from the right that is *not* in `chars`. The last character of the output `O` is `.`. This means `.` cannot be in `chars`.
- Let's choose a simple case. Let's assume the stripped characters were just spaces. We can set `chars = ' '`.
- For this to work, the input `text` must be `O` followed by one or more spaces. Let's choose `text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. "`.
- Let's trace this input: `f(text="new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. ", chars=' ')`.
    - `if ' ':` is true.
    - `text` becomes `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. ".rstrip(' ')`, which is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
    - This new `text` is not `''`.
    - The function returns `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
- This matches the output. So, `text="new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. "` and `chars=' '` is a valid input.

**Path 2: `if chars:` is false.**
- In this case, `chars` could be `''` or `None`. Let's choose `chars = ''`.
- The function executes `text = text.rstrip(' ')`.
- For the result to be `O`, the input `text` must be `O` followed by one or more spaces. Let's choose `text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. "`.
- Let's trace this input: `f(text="new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. ", chars='')`.
    - `if ''` is false.
    - The `else` block is executed: `text` becomes `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. ".rstrip(' ')`, which is `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
    - This new `text` is not `''`.
    - The function returns `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.
- This also matches the output.

Both paths provide valid solutions. I will choose the first path as it is a more general case and demonstrates the primary branch of the function's logic. The simplest possible scenario is stripping a single space.

Therefore, a valid and simple input is:
- `text`: `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2. "`
- `chars`: `' '`
