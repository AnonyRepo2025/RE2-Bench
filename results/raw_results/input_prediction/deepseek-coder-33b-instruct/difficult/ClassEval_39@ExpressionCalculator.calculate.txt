The output of the function is 3.0. This means that the input expression must be a mathematical expression that evaluates to 3.0.

The function `calculate` takes an expression as input and returns the result of the expression. The expression is a string that can contain numbers, operators, and parentheses. The function first transforms the expression into postfix notation, then evaluates the postfix notation to get the result.

The postfix notation is a way of writing mathematical expressions where every operator follows all of its operands. For example, the expression "2 + 3 * 4" in infix notation can be written in postfix notation as "2 3 4 * +".

The function `transform` is used to convert the infix notation to postfix notation. It replaces all whitespace characters with no space and replaces the '=' character with no space. It also replaces '-' with '~' if it is the first character or if it is preceded by an operator or a left parenthesis.

The function `prepare` is used to convert the infix notation to postfix notation. It uses a stack to keep track of the operators. It iterates over the expression and for each character, if it is an operator, it pops operators from the stack and pushes them to the postfix stack until it finds an operator with lower priority. If it is a left parenthesis, it pushes it to the stack. If it is a right parenthesis, it pops operators from the stack and pushes them to the postfix stack until it finds a left parenthesis. If it is a number, it pushes it to the postfix stack.

The function `calculate` is used to evaluate the postfix notation. It iterates over the postfix stack and for each element, if it is a number, it pushes it to a result stack. If it is an operator, it pops two numbers from the result stack, applies the operator, and pushes the result back to the result stack.

The function `_calculate` is used to apply the operator to the two numbers.

The function `is_operator` is used to check if a character is an operator.

The function `compare` is used to compare the priority of two operators.

The function `transform` is used to transform the expression into a form that can be evaluated.

[THOUGHT]
The output of the function is ["exampl", "text"]. This means that the input text must be a string that when processed, results in the words "exampl" and "text".

The function `process` takes a text as input and returns a list of words. The text is first normalized by converting it to lowercase and removing all non-alphanumeric characters. The normalized text is then tokenized into words. The stop words are removed from the list of words. Finally, the words are stemmed by removing the last letter if it is 'e'.

The function `normalize` is used to convert the text to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters.

The function `tokenize` is used to split the text into words.

The function `remove_stop_words` is used to remove the stop words from the list of words.

The function `stem` is used to stem the words by removing the last letter if it is 'e'.

[THOUGHT]
The output of the function is 2.5. This means that the median of the combined sorted arrays must be 2.5.

The function `findMedianSortedArrays` takes two sorted arrays as input and returns the median of the combined array. The median of a sorted array is the middle value if the array has an odd number of elements, or the average of the two middle values if the array has an even number of elements.

The function first combines the two arrays into one sorted array. It then checks the length of the combined array. If the length is even, it returns the average of the two middle values. If the length is odd, it returns the middle value.
