The function `process_csv_data` reads a CSV file, processes the data, and writes the processed data back to a new CSV file. The function takes two arguments: `N`, which is the index of the column to be processed, and `save_file_name`, which is the name of the file to be processed.

The output of the function is 1, which means the function successfully wrote the processed data to the new CSV file.

The processed data is the uppercase version of the data in the `N`th column of the original CSV file.

Therefore, the input of the function should be such that the `N`th column of the CSV file specified by `save_file_name` contains data that can be converted to uppercase.

[THOUGHT]
The function `process_json_data` reads a JSON file, processes the data, and writes the processed data back to a new JSON file. The function takes two arguments: `key`, which is the key of the data to be processed, and `save_file_name`, which is the name of the file to be processed.

The output of the function is None, which means the function successfully wrote the processed data to the new JSON file.

The processed data is the value of the `key` in the JSON file specified by `save_file_name` converted to a string.

Therefore, the input of the function should be such that the `key` in the JSON file specified by `save_file_name` contains a value that can be converted to a string.

[THOUGHT]
The function `scrape_webpage` gets the HTML of a webpage, and saves it to a file. The function takes two arguments: `url`, which is the URL of the webpage to be scraped, and `save_file_name`, which is the name of the file to save the HTML to.

The output of the function is None, which means the function successfully wrote the HTML to the file.

Therefore, the input of the function should be such that the URL specified by `url` is a valid webpage that can be scraped.

[THOUGHT]
The function `process_text` finds all matches of a pattern in a text, and replaces them with a replacement. The function takes three arguments: `pattern`, `replacement`, and `text`.

The output of the function is "Hello, World!".

Therefore, the input of the function should be such that the `pattern` matches a part of the `text`, and the `replacement` is a string that can replace the matched part of the `text`.
