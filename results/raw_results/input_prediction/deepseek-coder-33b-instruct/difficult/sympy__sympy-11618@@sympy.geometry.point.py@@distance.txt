The output is the distance between two points. The distance formula is sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2).

The output is sqrt(17)/2, so the distance is sqrt(17).

The distance between two points is sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2).

So, the distance between the two points is sqrt(17).

The input should be a point with coordinates (sqrt(17), 0).
