1. The output is a fraction, which means the function is performing some kind of integration.
2. The function `polytope_integrate` is a method of a class, so `self` is not empty.
3. The `poly` argument is a polygon or a list of polygons.
4. The `expr` argument is the expression to be integrated.
5. The `kwargs` argument is empty.
6. The output is a fraction, which means the function is performing some kind of integration.

1. The function `get_max_profit` calculates the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling a stock.
2. The input is a list of prices for the stock.
3. The output is the maximum profit that can be made.
4. The maximum profit is 5, so the last price must be 5 more than the minimum price in the list.
5. The minimum price is 1, so the last price must be 6.
