The output is 1, which means there is only one pair of indices (i, j) such that the substring from index i to j (inclusive) is divisible by 2019.
The substring from index i to j (inclusive) is divisible by 2019 if and only if the sum of the digits from index 0 to i (inclusive) minus the sum of the digits from index 0 to j (inclusive) is divisible by 2019.
So, we need to find two indices i and j such that the difference of the sums of the digits from index 0 to i (inclusive) and from index 0 to j (inclusive) is divisible by 2019.

The output is 1, which means the minimum difference between any element in array a and any element in array b is 1.
The minimum difference between any element in array a and any element in array b is 1 if and only if there is an element in array a that is 1 less than an element in array b.
So, we need to find an element in array a that is 1 less than an element in array b.
