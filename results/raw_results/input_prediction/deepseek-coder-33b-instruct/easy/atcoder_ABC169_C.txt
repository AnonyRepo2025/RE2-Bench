The output is 0, which means the multiplication of a and b divided by 100 is 0.
This means a * b must be less than 100.
Since a and b are integers, a * b must be less than 100.
This means a and b must be less than 10.

The output is 10, which means the function f(n) is called with 10 as an argument.
The function f(n) is defined to return 0 if n is 0, and n + f(n - 2) otherwise.
This means the function is called recursively with decreasing even numbers until it reaches 0.
The function is called with 10 as an argument, so the output must be the sum of all even numbers from 0 to 10.
This sum is 30.
