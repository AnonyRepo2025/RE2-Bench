The output is a string of characters, and the only operation performed on the input is the `center` method, which adds padding to the left and right of the string to make it center aligned.

The `center` method takes an integer as an argument, which is the width of the resulting string. The padding is added evenly to both sides of the string, so the total length of the resulting string is the width.

The width of the resulting string is 9, which is the length of the output string.

The input string is "8", which is the only character in the output string.
