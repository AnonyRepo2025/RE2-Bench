The function `f` removes the `substring` from the start of `string` until `string` no longer starts with `substring`.

If `string` is "" and `substring` is anything, `string` will remain "", so the output will be "".

If `string` is anything and `substring` is "", `string` will remain unchanged, so the output will be `string`.

If `string` is "abc" and `substring` is "abc", `string` will become "", so the output will be "".

If `string` is "abc" and `substring` is "abcd", `string` will remain "abc", so the output will be "abc".

The function `f` multiplies two numbers.

If `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, the output will be 1.

If `x` is 1 and `y` is 2, the output will be 2.

If `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, the output will be 2.

If `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, the output will be 4.

The function `f` divides two numbers.

If `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, the output will be 1.

If `x` is 1 and `y` is 2, the output will be 0.5.

If `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, the output will be 2.

If `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, the output will be 1.
