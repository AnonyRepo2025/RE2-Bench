The output is a string of lowercase letters and '#' symbols. The '#' symbol is not a letter, so it must have been the result of some transformation on the input.
The transformation is likely to be a simple cipher, such as a Caesar cipher with a shift of 2.
The input text is likely to be a sentence, possibly a quote from Shakespeare.
