The function `generate_email_pattern` does not take any input arguments. It generates a regular expression pattern for matching email addresses. The pattern is a string that describes the structure of an email address. The pattern is a regular expression that matches any string that looks like an email address.

The pattern `\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b` matches any string that:

- Starts with a word boundary (`\\b`)
- Followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens (`[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+`)
- Followed by an at symbol (`@`)
- Followed by one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens (`[A-Za-z0-9.-]+`)
- Followed by a dot (`\\.`)
- Followed by two or more alphabetic characters (`[A-Z|a-z]{2,}`)
- Ends with a word boundary (`\\b`)

This pattern is used in the `re.match` function to check if a string is a valid email address.

[THOUGHT]
The function `isValid` checks if a given string of parentheses, brackets, and braces is valid. A string is considered valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, the opening bracket is popped from the stack. If it is not, or if the stack is empty, the string is not valid.

The string must also be empty at the end, as all opening brackets must have been closed.

The string must also be empty at the end, as all opening brackets must have been closed.

If the function returns false, it means that the string is not valid. This could be due to a mismatch in the types of brackets, or a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket.
