The output is a list of numbers [-2, 4, -4]. 
The function `f` is inserting elements from the list `numbers` at the given `index`. 
The output list is the same as the input list, but with the elements inserted at the given index.
This means that the input list `numbers` must have been [4, -4] and the `index` must have been 0.
