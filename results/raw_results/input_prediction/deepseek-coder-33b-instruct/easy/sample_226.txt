The output is [1, 3, 3]. This means that the function appended the number 3 to the list twice. 
The function iterates over the list and appends the number to the list if it is divisible by 3. 
This means that the input list must have at least one number that is divisible by 3. 
The function also appends the number to the list while iterating over it, which means that the list will keep growing. 
This means that the function will run indefinitely if the input list does not contain a number that is divisible by 3. 
Therefore, the input list must be [1, 3] or [3] or [1, 3, 3] or [3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3] or [3, 3,
