The function `f` removes the prefix from the start of the text until the prefix is no longer at the start of the text.
The output is "dbtdabdahesyehu", which means the prefix was removed from the start of the text until it was no longer at the start of the text.
The prefix could be "dbtdabdahe", and the text could be "s" + "yehu".
