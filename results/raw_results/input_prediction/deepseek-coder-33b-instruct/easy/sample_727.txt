The output is a sorted list of strings. The prefix is removed from the start of each string in the list if it exists. The prefix is not removed from the strings that do not start with it.

The output list is sorted in lexicographic order, so the first string in the output is "dxh", which means it is the smallest string in the input list that does not start with the prefix.

The second string in the output is "ix", which means it is the smallest string in the input list that does not start with the prefix and is larger than "dxh".

The third string in the output is "snegi", which means it is the smallest string in the input list that does not start with the prefix and is larger than "ix".

The fourth string in the output is "wiubvu", which means it is the smallest string in the input list that does not start with the prefix and is larger than "snegi".

Therefore, the input list must contain the strings "dxh", "ix", "snegi", and "wiubvu", in some order. The prefix must be the empty string.
