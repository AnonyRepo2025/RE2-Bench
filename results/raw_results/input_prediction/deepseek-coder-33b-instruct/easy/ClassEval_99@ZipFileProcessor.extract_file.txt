The function `extract_file` is extracting a file from a zip file. The function takes two arguments: `file_name` and `output_path`. The `file_name` is the name of the file to be extracted from the zip file, and `output_path` is the path where the extracted file will be saved.

The output of the function is a boolean value indicating whether the file was successfully extracted or not. If the output is `true`, it means the file was successfully extracted.

The input of the function is not provided in the question, so we can't predict the input. However, we can assume that the `file_name` and `output_path` are valid and the zip file exists.

[THOUGHT]
The function `load_json` is loading a JSON string into a Python object. The function takes no arguments. The `json_str` is the JSON string to be loaded.

The output of the function is a Python object. If the JSON string is valid, the function will return the corresponding Python object. If the JSON string is invalid, the function will return `None`.

The input of the function is not provided in the question, so we can't predict the input. However, we can assume that the `json_str` is a valid JSON string.

[THOUGHT]
The function `get` is sending a GET request to a URL and returning the response text. The function takes no arguments. The `url` is the URL to send the GET request to.

The output of the function is a string. If the request is successful, the function will return the response text. If the request is unsuccessful, the function will return `None`.

The input of the function is not provided in the question, so we can't predict the input. However, we can assume that the `url` is a valid URL.

The function `read_file` is reading a file and returning its content. The function takes no arguments. The `file_name` is the name of the file to be read.

The output of the function is a string. If the file is successfully read, the function will return the content of the file. If the file is not successfully read, the function will return `None`.

The input of the function is not provided in the question, so we can't predict the input. However, we can assume that the `file_name` is a valid file name.

[THOUGHT]
The function `match` is matching a text with a regular expression pattern. The function takes one argument: `text`. The `text` is the text to be matched, and `pattern` is the regular expression pattern.

The output of the function is a boolean value indicating whether the text matches the pattern or not. If the output is `true`, it means the text matches the pattern.

The input of the function is not provided in the question, so we can't predict the input. However, we can assume that the `text` and `pattern` are valid.
