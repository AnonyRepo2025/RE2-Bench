The output is "the cow goes moo#". The '#' at the end suggests that the function `ljust` was used with a fillchar of '#'.
The length of the output is 18, so the original string must have been 17 characters long.
The function `ljust` is used to left-justify a string, padding it on the right with a specified character.
So, the original string must have been "the cow goes moo" and the fill character must have been '#'.

The output is "#the cow goes moo#". The '#' at the beginning and end suggests that the function `center` was used with a fillchar of '#'.
The length of the output is 18, so the original string must have been 16 characters long.
The function `center` is used to center a string, padding it on both sides with a specified character.
So, the original string must have been "the cow goes moo" and the fill character must have been '#'.
