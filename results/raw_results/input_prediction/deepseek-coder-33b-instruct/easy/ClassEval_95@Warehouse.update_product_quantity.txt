The method `update_product_quantity` is updating the quantity of a product in the inventory. The output is null, which means the method is not returning anything.

The inventory is a dictionary where the keys are product IDs and the values are dictionaries containing the product name and quantity. The orders dictionary is empty.

The product_id is the key in the inventory dictionary that we want to update. The quantity is the amount by which we want to increase the quantity of the product.

The output is null because the method is modifying the inventory dictionary in place and does not return anything.
