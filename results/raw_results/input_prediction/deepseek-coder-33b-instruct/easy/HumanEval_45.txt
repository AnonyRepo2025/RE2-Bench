The area of a triangle is given by the formula `a * h / 2.0`.
We know that `a * h = 80` and `a * h / 2.0 = 40.0`.
So, `a * h = 80` and `a * h / 2.0 = 40.0`.
Solving these two equations gives `a = 4` and `h = 10`.

A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.
So, the input must be a number that is greater than 1 and has no other divisors other than 1 and itself.
The only prime number that is greater than 1 and less than itself is 2.
