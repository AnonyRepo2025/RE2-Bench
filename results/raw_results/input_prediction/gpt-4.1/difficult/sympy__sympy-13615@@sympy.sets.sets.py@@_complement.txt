[THOUGHT]
We are given the output of the `_complement` method as a FiniteSet with elements 10 and 15 (represented as a frozenset). We need to determine the input `self` and `other` such that `self._complement(other)` returns a FiniteSet containing 10 and 15.

Let's analyze the `_complement` method for the relevant case:

- If `other` is a `FiniteSet`, the code does:
  - It uses `sift` to partition the elements of `other` into those that are contained in `self` (True), not contained (False), and unknown (None).
  - The result is `Union(FiniteSet(*sifted[False]), Complement(FiniteSet(*sifted[None]), self, evaluate=False) if sifted[None] else S.EmptySet)`

But the output is just a FiniteSet of 10 and 15, so the `sifted[False]` must be `{10, 15}` and `sifted[None]` is empty.

This means: `other` is a FiniteSet containing at least 10 and 15, and `self` is a set that does NOT contain 10 and 15, but may contain other elements of `other`.

But since the output is exactly `{10, 15}`, the simplest case is that `other` is `FiniteSet(10, 15)` and `self` is a set that contains none of these elements.

For example, if `self` is `FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)`, then `self.contains(10)` and `self.contains(15)` are both False, so the complement is `FiniteSet(10, 15)`.

Therefore, the minimal input is:
- `self`: a FiniteSet with elements not including 10 or 15 (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`)
- `other`: a FiniteSet with elements `{10, 15}`

So, in the input structure, `other._elements` is `frozenset({10, 15})`.
