[THOUGHT]
1. The output is the string: PredefinedSplit(test_fold="array([1, 1, 2, 2])")
2. This is the result of the __repr__ method, which uses _build_repr(self).
3. _build_repr is not shown, but from sklearn's conventions, it prints the class name and the constructor arguments, showing arrays as e.g. "array([1, 1, 2, 2])".
4. Therefore, self is an instance of PredefinedSplit, with test_fold = array([1, 1, 2, 2]).
5. unique_folds is likely a cached property or attribute, but not shown in the output, so we can infer it from test_fold.
6. unique_folds would be the unique values in test_fold, i.e. [1, 2].
7. The args and kwargs are empty, as __repr__ takes only self.
8. So, the input should be:
   - self.test_fold = np.array([1, 1, 2, 2])
   - self.unique_folds = [1, 2] (or np.array([1, 2]))
