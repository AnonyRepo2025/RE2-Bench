Let's analyze the function `simple_tag` in the `Library` class.

- The method signature is: `def simple_tag(self, func=None, takes_context=None, name=None):`
- The output is `{}` (an empty dict). This suggests that the function returned is `{}`.
- However, in the code, `simple_tag` is a decorator factory. If `func` is None, it returns the inner `dec` function. If `func` is callable, it calls `dec(func)` and returns the result of that.
- The only way for `simple_tag` to return `{}` is if `func` is `{}` (i.e., a dict), which is not callable. In this case, the code will go to the last `else` branch and raise a `ValueError('Invalid arguments provided to simple_tag')`. But that would not return `{}`.

But let's look at the structure: the input structure for `func` is `{}` (an empty dict), and the output is `{}`. This suggests that the function is being called with `func={}` and returns `{}`.

But in the code, if `func` is not None and not callable, it raises an error. But the output is `{}`. So perhaps the function is being called with `func={}` and the code is being mocked to return `{}`.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is being called with no arguments, so `func=None`, and the function returns the inner `dec` function, which is a function object, but in the output, it is represented as `{}` (i.e., a placeholder for a function object).

Given the structure, the only way for the output to be `{}` is if the input is `func=None`, and the function returns the decorator function `dec`, which is a function object, but in the output, it is represented as `{}`.

Therefore, the input should be `func=None`.
