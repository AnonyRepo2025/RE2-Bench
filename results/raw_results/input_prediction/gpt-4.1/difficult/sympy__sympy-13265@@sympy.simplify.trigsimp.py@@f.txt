[THOUGHT]
We are given the function `f(rv)` from within `exptrigsimp`. The function is designed to simplify certain products involving exponentials and trigonometric/hyperbolic functions. The output is `"exp(2*I*x) + 1"`. We are to find an input `rv` (a SymPy expression) such that `f(rv)` returns `exp(2*I*x) + 1`.

Let's analyze the function `f`:

- If `rv` is not a Mul, it returns `rv` unchanged.
- If `rv` is a Mul, it tries to manipulate the powers dictionary, looking for terms of the form `k.is_Add and len(k.args) == 2`, and then does some pattern matching and rewriting.

But in the output, we see `"exp(2*I*x) + 1"`, which is an Add, not a Mul. So for `f(rv)` to return this, the input `rv` must be exactly `exp(2*I*x) + 1`, and the first line of `f` will return it unchanged.

Therefore, the input is simply the same as the output: `exp(2*I*x) + 1`.

In SymPy, this would be constructed as `exp(2*I*x) + 1`.

So, the input is:
```
{
    "rv": exp(2*I*x) + 1
}
```
