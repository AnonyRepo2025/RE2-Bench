[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `_osborne(e, d)` and the output.

1. The function returns `bottom_up(e, f)`, where `f` is a function that, for any node `rv` in the expression tree:
   - If `rv` is not a HyperbolicFunction, it returns `rv` unchanged.
   - If `rv` is a HyperbolicFunction, it applies a transformation:
     - For `sinh(a)`, it returns `I * sin(a * d)`
     - For `cosh(a)`, it returns `cos(a * d)`
     - For `tanh(a)`, it returns `I * tan(a * d)`
     - For `coth(a)`, it returns `cot(a * d) / I`
     - For `sech(a)`, it returns `sec(a * d)`
     - For `csch(a)`, it returns `csc(a * d) / I`

2. The output is `"2*I*sin(2*_Dummy_588)"`.

3. Let's try to reverse-engineer the input:
   - The output is `2*I*sin(2*_Dummy_588)`.
   - The transformation for `sinh(a)` is `I * sin(a * d)`.
   - The output has a factor of 2, so the input must have had a factor of 2 as well.
   - The argument to `sin` is `2*_Dummy_588`, so the input to `sinh` must have been `2*_Dummy_588` (since `a * d = 2*_Dummy_588` and if `d=1`, then `a=2*_Dummy_588`).
   - The input must have been `2 * sinh(2*_Dummy_588)`.

4. The function signature is `_osborne(e, d)`, but in the provided code, the function only takes two arguments: `e` and `d`. However, in the STRUCTURE, only `e` is a placeholder, and `d` is not present. This suggests that `d` is fixed, likely to 1.

5. Therefore, the input is:
   - `e = 2 * sinh(2*_Dummy_588)`

6. To match the output, we need to use SymPy's `Dummy` symbol for `_Dummy_588`.

7. The input should be a SymPy expression: `2 * sinh(2*Dummy('_Dummy_588'))`
