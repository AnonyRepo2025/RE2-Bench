[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and the function step by step.

1. The function in question is `_get_params(self, attr, deep=True)` from `_BaseComposition`.
2. It first calls `super(_BaseComposition, self).get_params(deep=deep)`. This is `BaseEstimator.get_params`, which returns a dict of all parameters (from `self._get_param_names()`), and if `deep` is True, it recursively gets parameters from any attribute that has a `get_params` method, prefixing them with `<attr>__`.
3. Then, if `deep` is False, it returns this dict. If `deep` is True, it continues:
   - It gets `estimators = getattr(self, attr)`.
   - It updates the output dict with `estimators` (which must be a dict or list of pairs).
   - For each `(name, estimator)` in `estimators`, if `estimator` has `get_params`, it adds all its parameters to the output dict, prefixed with `name__`.

Now, let's look at the output:
- There are keys: "n_jobs", "remainder__copy", "remainder__with_mean", "remainder__with_std", "remainder", "transformer_weights", "transformers", "trans1".
- "remainder" is a dict with "with_mean", "with_std", "copy".
- "remainder__copy", "remainder__with_mean", "remainder__with_std" are the same as the values in "remainder".
- "transformers" is null, but "trans1" is "passthrough".

This suggests:
- The `attr` argument is likely "transformers", since the function gets `estimators = getattr(self, attr)`, and then updates the output with `estimators`.
- But in the output, "transformers" is null, and "trans1" is "passthrough". This suggests that `self.transformers` is None, but the function still adds "trans1": "passthrough" to the output. This is only possible if the base estimator's get_params returns "trans1": "passthrough".
- The "remainder" attribute is an object with "with_mean", "with_std", "copy" attributes, and it has a get_params method that returns those as a dict. This is why we see "remainder__copy", etc.

So, the input must be:
- self.transformers = None
- self.remainder = an object with attributes with_mean=True, with_std=False, copy=True, and a get_params method that returns those as a dict.
- self.n_jobs = 1
- self.transformer_weights = None

The "trans1": "passthrough" key must come from the base estimator's get_params, i.e., self.trans1 = "passthrough".

The function is called with:
- attr = "transformers"
- deep = True
