Let's analyze the output and deduce the input step by step.

1. **Output Analysis**:
   - The output is a sparse matrix with:
     - `_shape`: [2, 4] → 2 samples, 4 features (after encoding)
     - `indptr`: "[0 0 1]" → CSR format, so:
       - indptr[0]=0, indptr[1]=0, indptr[2]=1
       - This means: row 0 has 0 non-zeros, row 1 has 1 non-zero (at indices[0]=1)
     - `indices`: "[1]" → The only nonzero is at column 1 (0-based)
     - `data`: "[1.]" → The value is 1.0

   - So, the encoded matrix is:
     ```
     [[0 0 0 0]
      [0 1 0 0]]
     ```

2. **What input X could produce this?**
   - Only the second row has a nonzero, at column 1.
   - The first row is all zeros. In OneHotEncoder, this happens if the value is unknown (and handle_unknown='ignore'), or if the value is dropped (with drop='first' or similar).

3. **What is the encoder configuration?**
   - The output shape is (2, 4), so the encoder has 4 output features.
   - Let's assume 2 input features, each with 2 categories (the most common case for 4 output columns).
   - Let's check the structure: categories, drop, handle_unknown, etc.

4. **What is the mapping?**
   - For 2 features, each with 2 categories, and drop=None, the output would be 4 columns.
   - Let's check the mapping for each row:
     - For row 0: all zeros → either unknown category (with handle_unknown='ignore'), or all dropped (but with drop=None, this is only possible for unknown).
     - For row 1: only column 1 is 1 → this means the value in feature 0 is the second category (index 1), and feature 1 is the first category (index 0).

5. **What are the categories_?**
   - Let's assume categories_ = [array(['a', 'b'], dtype=object), array(['c', 'd'], dtype=object)]
   - The output columns are: [f0=a, f0=b, f1=c, f1=d]
   - For input [b, c], the encoding is [0,1,1,0] (but that's two nonzeros).
   - For input [a, d], the encoding is [1,0,0,1] (again, two nonzeros).
   - For input [unknown, c], with handle_unknown='ignore', the encoding is [0,0,1,0] (one nonzero at index 2).
   - But in our output, the only nonzero is at index 1 (second column).

6. **What input X produces [0,1,0,0] for a row?**
   - That would be: feature 0 is category 1 (second category), feature 1 is category 0 (first category).
   - So, input: [b, c]
   - Let's check the mapping:
     - feature 0: 'a'→[1,0,0,0], 'b'→[0,1,0,0]
     - feature 1: 'c'→[0,0,1,0], 'd'→[0,0,0,1]
   - But OneHotEncoder concatenates the features, so for [b, c], the output is [0,1,1,0] (two nonzeros).
   - But our output has only one nonzero.

7. **What if one feature is unknown?**
   - Let's try input: [unknown, c]
     - feature 0: unknown → all zeros in first two columns
     - feature 1: c → [0,0,1,0]
     - So output: [0,0,1,0] (nonzero at index 2)
   - But our output has nonzero at index 1.

   - Try input: [b, unknown]
     - feature 0: b → [0,1,0,0]
     - feature 1: unknown → [0,0,0,0]
     - Output: [0,1,0,0] (nonzero at index 1)
   - This matches our output for row 1.

   - For row 0: all zeros. That would be [unknown, unknown].

8. **So, input X is:**
   ```
   [
     [unknown, unknown],
     [b, unknown]
   ]
   ```
   - Let's pick actual values. Suppose categories_ = [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]
   - So, unknown can be 'x' (not in ['a', 'b']) and 'y' (not in ['c', 'd']).

   - So, X = [['x', 'y'], ['b', 'y']]

9. **Encoder configuration:**
   - categories='auto'
   - sparse='deprecated'
   - sparse_output=True
   - dtype=np.float64
   - handle_unknown='ignore'
   - drop=None
   - min_frequency=None
   - max_categories=None
   - feature_name_combiner='concat'
   - _infrequent_enabled=False
   - n_features_in_=2
   - categories_ = [np.array(['a', 'b'], dtype=object), np.array(['c', 'd'], dtype=object)]
   - _drop_idx_after_grouping = None
   - drop_idx_ = None
   - _n_features_outs = [2,2]

10. **dtype field in structure:**
    - The structure expects a dict with all dunder methods for dtype. This is a placeholder for np.float64, so we can use np.float64.

11. **Final input:**
    - self: as above
    - args: X = [['x', 'y'], ['b', 'y']]
    - kwargs: {}
