[THOUGHT]
The function `generate_primes` returns all prime numbers up to and including `self.n`. The output is `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`. The largest prime in the list is 13, and the next prime after 13 is 17, which is not included. This means `self.n` must be at least 13, but less than 17 (otherwise 17 would be included if `self.n` was 17 or more).

Let's check what happens for `n = 13`:
- The primes up to 13 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. This matches the output.

If `n = 14`, the primes up to 14 are still: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 (since 14 is not prime).
If `n = 15`, same as above.
If `n = 16`, same as above.
If `n = 17`, the output would include 17.

But the class is initialized with `n`, and `primes` is set to the result of `generate_primes()`. So, for the input, `self.n` should be 13, and `self.primes` should be `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`.

The method `generate_primes` takes no arguments, so `args` and `kwargs` are empty.
