Let's analyze the output and the function to deduce the input.

1. The function `scale` is a standard scaler: it centers and scales the input array (subtracts mean, divides by std) along the specified axis (default axis=0, i.e., column-wise for 2D, but for 1D, it's the only axis).
2. The output is a 1D numpy array of length 400, with values that look like standard normal data (mean ~0, std ~1, with some values >2 and < -2).
3. The function, for 1D input, will:
   - Compute mean and std of the array.
   - Subtract mean, divide by std.
   - Return the result.

So, the output is: (X - mean(X)) / std(X)

To recover X, we need to "unscale" the output:
   X = output * std + mean

But we don't know mean and std. However, if the output is exactly the result of standard scaling, then:
   mean(output) ≈ 0
   std(output) ≈ 1

So, if we take the output, and "reverse" the scaling with any mean and std, we get a family of possible X. But the most likely scenario is that the input X was a random array of length 400, and the output is its standard scaling.

Therefore, the input X is just the output array, but "unscaled": i.e., the output array was obtained by standard scaling some X, so if we take the output and "reverse" the scaling, we get X.

But since the output is already standard scaled, the only way to get this output is to pass an array X with mean and std such that (X - mean)/std = output.

But if we take output as input, then the output would be (output - mean(output))/std(output), which would be a new array with mean 0 and std 1, but not the same as the original output.

Therefore, the only way to get this output is to pass as input an array X such that mean(X) = m, std(X) = s, and (X - m)/s = output.

So, X = output * s + m

But since the function uses np.nanmean and np.nanstd, and the output is already mean 0, std 1, the only way to get this output is to pass as input an array X with mean m and std s, and the output is (X - m)/s.

But the only way to get this exact output is to pass as input an array X = output * s + m, for any m and s ≠ 0.

But the most likely scenario is that the input X was a random array, and the output is its standard scaling.

Alternatively, perhaps the input X is the output array, and the output is the standard scaling of that array, i.e., (output - mean(output))/std(output).

But then the output would have mean 0 and std 1, but the values would be different.

Therefore, the only way to get this output is to pass as input an array X such that (X - mean(X))/std(X) = output.

So, for any output, the input X = output * s + m, for any m and s ≠ 0.

But the most likely scenario is that the input X was a random array, and the output is its standard scaling.

But since the output is already mean 0, std 1, perhaps the input X was the output array, and the output is the standard scaling of that array, which would be a different array.

Alternatively, perhaps the input X was output * s + m, for some m and s.

But since the function is deterministic, and the output is given, the only way to get this output is to pass as input X = output * s + m, and the function will return (X - mean(X))/std(X) = output.

Therefore, let's solve for m and s:

Let X = output * s + m

Then, (X - mean(X))/std(X) = (output * s + m - mean(output * s + m))/std(output * s + m) = (output * s + m - (mean(output) * s + m))/ (std(output) * s) = (output * s - mean(output) * s)/ (std(output) * s) = (output - mean(output))/std(output)

But the output is already mean 0, std 1, so mean(output) = 0, std(output) = 1

Therefore, (output - 0)/1 = output

So, for any m and s ≠ 0, if we set X = output * s + m, the function will return output.

Therefore, the simplest is to set s = 1, m = 0, so X = output

So, the input X is the array given in the output.
