[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and the RFECV.fit logic to reconstruct the input.

1. The output shows:
   - Only the last feature is selected: "support_": "[False False False  True]"
   - The ranking is: "[4 3 2 1]" (so feature 3 is best, then 2, then 1, then 0)
   - n_features_ is "1" (so only one feature is selected)
   - grid_scores_ is "[0. 0. 0. 0.]" (so for each number of features, the cross-validated score is 0)
   - The estimator_ has coef_ "[1.]", so the final estimator is fit on a single feature, and its coefficient is 1.

2. The RFECV parameters are:
   - step=1 (remove one feature at a time)
   - min_features_to_select=1 (stop at 1 feature)
   - cv=5 (5-fold cross-validation)
   - scoring=None (so use estimator.score)
   - estimator: {"foo_param": 0} (unknown estimator, but must have fit, score, and coef_)

3. The process:
   - At each step, the least important feature is removed, until only 1 remains.
   - The grid_scores_ is length 4 (so n_features=4).
   - All grid_scores_ are 0, so in every cross-validation split, the estimator's score is 0.

4. The final estimator is fit on the last feature (feature 3), and its coef_ is [1.]. This suggests that the estimator is a linear model, and the data is such that fitting on the last feature gives coef_ = 1.

5. The ranking is [4 3 2 1], so feature 3 is best, then 2, then 1, then 0. This is the reverse order: feature 3 is most important, feature 0 is least.

6. The support_ is [False False False True], so only the last feature is selected.

7. The grid_scores_ are all 0. This means that, for every number of features, the cross-validated score is 0. Since scoring=None, this means estimator.score(X, y) always returns 0.

8. The estimator_ has coef_ = [1.], so after fitting on the selected feature, the coefficient is 1.

9. Let's try to reconstruct X and y.

   - X must be a 2D array with 4 features (n_features=4).
   - y must be a 1D array with the same number of samples as X.

   Let's assume the estimator is a dummy estimator that always returns 0 for score, and when fit on a single feature, sets coef_ = [1.]. Let's make a minimal X and y.

   Let's try X = np.eye(4), y = np.ones(4). But then fitting on any feature would give coef_ = 1, but the score would not necessarily be 0.

   Alternatively, perhaps the estimator is a custom estimator that always returns 0 for score, and sets coef_ = [1.] when fit.

   Since the output is not about the data, but about the process, and the only requirement is that X has 4 features, and y has the same number of samples, let's use a simple X and y.

   Let's use:
   X = [[1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]]
   y = [0, 0, 0, 0]

   This will make the estimator fit on each feature separately, and the process will remove features in the order 0, 1, 2, leaving 3 as the last.

   The ranking will be [4, 3, 2, 1], support_ will be [False, False, False, True], n_features_ = 1.

   The grid_scores_ will be 0 if the estimator's score always returns 0.

   So, the input is:
   - self.estimator = {"foo_param": 0}
   - step = 1
   - cv = 5
   - scoring = null
   - verbose = 0
   - n_jobs = null
   - min_features_to_select = 1
   - X = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]
   - y = [0,0,0,0]
