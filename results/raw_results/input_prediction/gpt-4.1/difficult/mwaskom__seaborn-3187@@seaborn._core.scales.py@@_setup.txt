[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and the function step by step.

1. The function is ContinuousBase._setup(self, data, prop, axis=None).
2. The output shows:
   - "values": null
   - "norm": null
   - "trans": "log"
   - "_tick_params" and "_label_params" are present but all fields are null or empty.
   - "_legend": null
   - "_priority": 0
   - "_matplotlib_scale" is present, with a "_transform" that has "_forward" and "_inverse" as empty dicts.
   - "_pipeline": null
   - "_spacer": {}

3. The function starts by copying self, then ensures _tick_params and _label_params are set (if None, calls tick() and label()). In the output, both are present but all fields are null, suggesting they were already set to these values before _setup was called.

4. The function then gets forward, inverse = new._get_transform(). It then calls new._get_scale(str(data.name), forward, inverse). The output's "_matplotlib_scale" has a "_transform" with empty "_forward" and "_inverse", suggesting these are dummy or empty callables, or perhaps the default.

5. The function then checks if prop.normed. If so, it sets up normalization; otherwise, normalize, vmin, vmax = None. Since "norm": null in the output, and "values": null, it suggests that prop.normed is False.

6. The function sets new._pipeline = [axis.convert_units, forward, normalize, prop.get_mapping(new, data)]. But in the output, "_pipeline": null, suggesting that either this assignment was skipped or the pipeline is not serializable and thus null in the output.

7. The function defines a spacer function and assigns it to new._spacer. In the output, "_spacer": {} (an empty dict), which may be a placeholder for a function.

8. If prop.legend is True, it sets up the legend. In the output, "_legend": null, so prop.legend is False.

9. The function returns new.

So, to get this output:
- self.norm is None
- self.trans is "log"
- self._tick_params and _label_params are present but all fields are null or empty (so they were set before)
- self._legend is None
- self._priority is 0
- data is a pandas Series with a name (since str(data.name) is used), but the actual data values are not used since prop.normed is False and prop.legend is False.
- prop.normed is False, prop.legend is False, prop.variable can be anything.

For the Series, the minimal structure is needed: _is_copy, _mgr (with axes and blocks), _item_cache, _attrs, _flags, _name, _cacher. These can be set to minimal values.

Summary of required input:
- self: norm=None, trans="log", _tick_params and _label_params as in output, _legend=None, _priority=0
- data: a Series with minimal structure, name can be anything
- prop: variable can be anything, but prop.normed=False, prop.legend=False
