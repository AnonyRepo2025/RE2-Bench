[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function in question: `create_method(name, method)` is defined inside `_get_queryset_methods`. It returns a function `manager_method` that is decorated with `@wraps(method)`. The `@wraps` decorator from `functools` sets the `__wrapped__` attribute of the returned function to the original `method` argument.

Given the output:
```
{
    "__wrapped__": {}
}
```
This means that the function returned by `create_method` has its `__wrapped__` attribute set to `{}`. In Python, this would only happen if the `method` argument passed to `create_method` was the empty dict `{}`.

The `name` argument is not reflected in the output, so it can be any value.

Therefore, to get this output, we must call `create_method` with `method={}` (an empty dict), and any value for `name`.
