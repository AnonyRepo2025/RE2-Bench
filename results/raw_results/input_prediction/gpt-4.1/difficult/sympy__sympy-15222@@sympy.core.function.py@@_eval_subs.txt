[THOUGHT]
We are given the output "2*x" from the method _eval_subs. This method is a method of the Application class, which is a subclass of Function in SymPy. The method is designed to perform substitution: if the function matches "old" and the number of arguments matches, it replaces the function with "new", recursively substituting in the arguments.

Let's reason step by step:

1. The output is "2*x". This is a simple multiplication expression, which in SymPy would be represented as Mul(2, x) or just 2*x.

2. The _eval_subs method is called on an Application instance (i.e., a function application). The substitution only happens if:
   - old.is_Function and new.is_Function and callable(old) and callable(new)
   - old == self.func
   - len(self.args) in new.nargs

3. The substitution returns new(*[i._subs(old, new) for i in self.args]). So, the function is replaced, and the arguments are recursively substituted.

4. For the output to be "2*x", the most likely scenario is that the original function was something like f(x), and we are substituting f with a function that doubles its argument, i.e., lambda x: 2*x, or a Function with that behavior.

5. The input structure for "old" is a Function class (with various attributes), and "new" is a Function with nargs containing some elements.

6. The output is not a function application, but a multiplication. This suggests that the substitution replaced the function application with a multiplication.

7. In SymPy, if you do f(x).subs(f, lambda x: 2*x), you get 2*x.

8. Therefore, the most likely input is:
   - self: an Application instance representing f(x)
   - old: the Function class f
   - new: a lambda or a Function that, when called with x, returns 2*x

9. The structure for "old" is a Function class (e.g., f), and for "new" is a Function with nargs containing 1 (since f(x) is unary).

10. The module for "old" is likely "sympy.core.function", and the docstring is the docstring for Function or UndefinedFunction.

11. The "_nargs" for "old" is likely 1.

12. For "new", nargs._elements is (1,).

Therefore, the input should be:
- self: an Application instance (e.g., f(x)), but only nargs is shown in the structure, so we leave it as empty dict.
- args:
    - old: a Function class (e.g., f) with module "sympy.core.function", docstring as per Function, _nargs=1, etc.
    - new: a Function with nargs._elements = (1,)

We don't need to fill in the actual function name, just the structure.
