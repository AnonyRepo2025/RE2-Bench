[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and work backwards to deduce the input.

The output is:
[
    "10",
    "days since 2000-01-01",
    "gregorian"
]

This means:
- num = 10
- units = "days since 2000-01-01"
- calendar = "gregorian"

The function signature is:
def encode_cf_datetime(dates, units=None, calendar=None):

If units and calendar are provided, they are used as-is (after some normalization). If not, they are inferred from the dates.

The function tries to encode the dates as a number of time units (here, days) since the reference date (here, 2000-01-01), using the specified calendar.

Let's focus on how num is computed.

The main code path is:
- If calendar is standard/gregorian/proleptic_gregorian and dates is datetime64[ns], then:
    - delta, ref_date = _unpack_netcdf_time_units(units)
    - delta_units = _netcdf_to_numpy_timeunit(delta)
    - time_delta = np.timedelta64(1, delta_units).astype('timedelta64[ns]')
    - ref_date = pd.Timestamp(ref_date)
    - dates_as_index = pd.DatetimeIndex(dates.ravel())
    - time_deltas = dates_as_index - ref_date
    - num = time_deltas // time_delta (if all divisible), else time_deltas / time_delta

So, for num = 10, units = "days since 2000-01-01", calendar = "gregorian", what must dates be?

Let’s assume the simplest case: dates is a single datetime64[ns] value, and units and calendar are provided as above.

Let’s compute what date would give num = 10.

- ref_date = "2000-01-01"
- delta = "days"
- So, time_delta = 1 day
- num = (date - ref_date) // 1 day = 10
- So, date = ref_date + 10 days = "2000-01-11"

So, if dates = np.datetime64("2000-01-11"), units = "days since 2000-01-01", calendar = "gregorian", the function will return (10, "days since 2000-01-01", "gregorian").

The output is a list of strings, so the function must have returned (num, units, calendar), where num is a numpy scalar or array, but the test harness converted it to a string for display.

Therefore, the input should be:
- dates: a single-element array or scalar of np.datetime64("2000-01-11")
- units: "days since 2000-01-01"
- calendar: "gregorian"
