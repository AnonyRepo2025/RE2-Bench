[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function in question is `Function._eval_evalf(self, prec)`. The output is `"0.e+0"`, which is the string representation of the floating-point number 0.

2. The function first tries to find an mpmath function corresponding to `self.func.__name__`. If not found, it tries to use `self._imp_` on the evaluated arguments. If that fails, it returns None.

3. If an mpmath function is found, it converts the arguments to mpmath numbers and calls the function. If any argument is "bad" (as defined in the `bad` function), it returns None.

4. If all goes well, it returns `Expr._from_mpmath(v, prec)`, where `v` is the result of the mpmath function.

5. The output is `"0.e+0"`, so the result of the mpmath function must be 0.

6. Let's consider what kind of function and arguments would produce 0 as a result. Since this is a `Function` object, and the output is 0, the simplest case is the addition of two numbers that sum to zero.

7. Looking at the call chain, if the function is `Add`, and the arguments are `[1, -1]`, then the sum is 0.

8. Let's check how the arguments are stored. The structure is:
```
{
    "self": {
        "nargs": {
            "_elements": XXX
        }
    },
    "args": {
        "prec": XXX
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
So, `self.nargs._elements` should be the arguments to the function.

9. The precision (`prec`) can be any reasonable integer, say 15.

10. Therefore, the input should be:
- `_elements`: [1, -1]
- `prec`: 15 (or any standard precision)
