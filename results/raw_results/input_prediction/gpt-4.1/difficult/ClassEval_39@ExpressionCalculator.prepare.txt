[THOUGHT]
The method `prepare` does not return anything (output is null), so the only way to deduce the input is to reverse-engineer what input would be passed to `prepare` to produce a certain state in the object. However, since the output is null, and the only argument to `prepare` is `expression`, we need to deduce what input could have been passed.

Given the code, the `prepare` method parses an infix mathematical expression (as a string) and converts it to postfix notation, storing the result in `self.postfix_stack`. The method does not return anything, so the output is always null.

The structure asks for the values of `postfix_stack`, `operat_priority`, and `expression`. Since the output is always null, the only thing we can infer is that the function was called with some string expression.

The default value of `operat_priority` is `[0, 3, 2, 1, -1, 1, 0, 2]`, as set in the constructor. The `postfix_stack` is a deque, which is empty before `prepare` is called.

Therefore, the most likely input is the initial state: `postfix_stack` is empty, `operat_priority` is the default, and `expression` is some string (could be any valid mathematical expression).

Since the output is always null, and no further information is given, the minimal input is the initial state with an example expression, such as "1+2".
