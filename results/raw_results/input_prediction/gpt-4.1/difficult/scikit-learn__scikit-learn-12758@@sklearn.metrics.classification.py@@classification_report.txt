Let's analyze the output and reconstruct the likely y_true and y_pred.

1. The output is a classification report for 3 classes: "blue", "green", "red".
2. The support (number of true samples for each class) is:
   - blue: 24
   - green: 31
   - red: 20
   Total: 75 samples.

3. The precision, recall, and f1-score for each class are:
   - blue: precision 0.83, recall 0.79, f1 0.81
   - green: precision 0.33, recall 0.10, f1 0.15
   - red: precision 0.42, recall 0.90, f1 0.57

4. The overall accuracy is 0.53 (40/75 correct).

Let's reconstruct y_true and y_pred step by step.

First, let's assign the true labels:
- y_true = ['blue'] * 24 + ['green'] * 31 + ['red'] * 20

Now, let's reconstruct y_pred for each group.

A. For "blue" (24 samples, recall 0.79):
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = TP / 24 = 0.79 → TP = 0.79 * 24 ≈ 19
- So, 19 "blue" samples were correctly predicted as "blue" (TP), 5 were misclassified (FN).

- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 0.83
- TP = 19, so TP + FP = 19 / 0.83 ≈ 22.89 → FP ≈ 3.89 ≈ 4
- So, 4 samples from other classes were incorrectly predicted as "blue" (FP).

B. For "green" (31 samples, recall 0.10):
- Recall = TP / 31 = 0.10 → TP = 3.1 ≈ 3
- So, 3 "green" samples were correctly predicted as "green" (TP), 28 were misclassified (FN).

- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 0.33
- TP = 3, so TP + FP = 3 / 0.33 ≈ 9.09 → FP ≈ 6.09 ≈ 6
- So, 6 samples from other classes were incorrectly predicted as "green" (FP).

C. For "red" (20 samples, recall 0.90):
- Recall = TP / 20 = 0.90 → TP = 18
- So, 18 "red" samples were correctly predicted as "red" (TP), 2 were misclassified (FN).

- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 0.42
- TP = 18, so TP + FP = 18 / 0.42 ≈ 42.86 → FP ≈ 24.86 ≈ 25
- So, 25 samples from other classes were incorrectly predicted as "red" (FP).

Now, let's check the total number of predictions for each class (support for y_pred):
- blue: TP_blue + FP_blue = 19 + 4 = 23
- green: TP_green + FP_green = 3 + 6 = 9
- red: TP_red + FP_red = 18 + 25 = 43

Sum: 23 + 9 + 43 = 75 (matches total samples).

Now, let's reconstruct y_pred for each group in y_true.

1. For y_true == "blue" (24 samples):
   - TP: 19 → predicted as "blue"
   - FN: 5 → predicted as not "blue" (either "green" or "red")

2. For y_true == "green" (31 samples):
   - TP: 3 → predicted as "green"
   - FN: 28 → predicted as not "green" (either "blue" or "red")

3. For y_true == "red" (20 samples):
   - TP: 18 → predicted as "red"
   - FN: 2 → predicted as not "red" (either "blue" or "green")

Now, let's distribute the FP for each class (i.e., which samples from other classes were predicted as that class):

- blue: FP = 4 (from green/red)
- green: FP = 6 (from blue/red)
- red: FP = 25 (from blue/green)

Let's assign the misclassifications:

Let's start with "blue" group:
- 19 predicted as "blue" (TP)
- 5 misclassified: how many as "green", how many as "red"? Let's decide later.

"green" group:
- 3 predicted as "green" (TP)
- 28 misclassified: as "blue" or "red"

"red" group:
- 18 predicted as "red" (TP)
- 2 misclassified: as "blue" or "green"

Now, let's assign the FP for each class:

- blue: FP = 4 (from green/red)
- green: FP = 6 (from blue/red)
- red: FP = 25 (from blue/green)

Let's try to assign the misclassifications so that the FP numbers match.

Let’s create a table:

| True  | Predicted as blue | Predicted as green | Predicted as red | Total |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| blue  | 19 (TP)           | x1                 | x2               | 24    |
| green | x3                | 3 (TP)             | x4               | 31    |
| red   | x5                | x6                 | 18 (TP)          | 20    |

We know:
- x1 + x2 = 5
- x3 + x4 = 28
- x5 + x6 = 2

Also, FP for blue = x3 + x5 = 4
FP for green = x1 + x6 = 6
FP for red = x2 + x4 = 25

Let’s solve:

From above:
x1 + x2 = 5
x3 + x4 = 28
x5 + x6 = 2

FP for blue: x3 + x5 = 4
FP for green: x1 + x6 = 6
FP for red: x2 + x4 = 25

Let’s solve step by step.

Let’s denote:
x1 = blue→green
x2 = blue→red
x3 = green→blue
x4 = green→red
x5 = red→blue
x6 = red→green

From above:
x1 + x2 = 5
x3 + x4 = 28
x5 + x6 = 2

x3 + x5 = 4 (FP for blue)
x1 + x6 = 6 (FP for green)
x2 + x4 = 25 (FP for red)

Let’s try to solve:

From x5 + x6 = 2, so x5 = 2 - x6

From x3 + x5 = 4 → x3 + (2 - x6) = 4 → x3 = 4 - 2 + x6 = 2 + x6

From x1 + x6 = 6 → x1 = 6 - x6

From x1 + x2 = 5 → (6 - x6) + x2 = 5 → x2 = 5 - (6 - x6) = x6 - 1

From x2 + x4 = 25 → (x6 - 1) + x4 = 25 → x4 = 25 - (x6 - 1) = 26 - x6

From x3 + x4 = 28 → (2 + x6) + (26 - x6) = 28 → 2 + x6 + 26 - x6 = 28 → 28 = 28

So, x6 can be any integer between 0 and 2 (since x5 + x6 = 2, both >= 0).

Let’s try x6 = 0:
x5 = 2 - 0 = 2
x3 = 2 + 0 = 2
x1 = 6 - 0 = 6
x2 = 0 - 1 = -1 (not possible, negative)
So x6 = 0 is not possible.

Try x6 = 1:
x5 = 2 - 1 = 1
x3 = 2 + 1 = 3
x1 = 6 - 1 = 5
x2 = 1 - 1 = 0
x4 = 26 - 1 = 25

Check all variables:
x1 = 5 (blue→green)
x2 = 0 (blue→red)
x3 = 3 (green→blue)
x4 = 25 (green→red)
x5 = 1 (red→blue)
x6 = 1 (red→green)

Check that all are >= 0 and sum to correct totals:
x1 + x2 = 5 + 0 = 5 (ok)
x3 + x4 = 3 + 25 = 28 (ok)
x5 + x6 = 1 + 1 = 2 (ok)

Now, check FP for each class:
FP for blue: x3 + x5 = 3 + 1 = 4 (ok)
FP for green: x1 + x6 = 5 + 1 = 6 (ok)
FP for red: x2 + x4 = 0 + 25 = 25 (ok)

So, this is a valid solution.

So, the confusion matrix is:

| True  | Predicted as blue | Predicted as green | Predicted as red | Total |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| blue  | 19                | 5                  | 0                | 24    |
| green | 3                 | 3                  | 25               | 31    |
| red   | 1                 | 1                  | 18               | 20    |

Now, let's reconstruct y_true and y_pred arrays accordingly.

- For blue (24):
  - 19 predicted as blue
  - 5 predicted as green
  - 0 predicted as red

- For green (31):
  - 3 predicted as blue
  - 3 predicted as green
  - 25 predicted as red

- For red (20):
  - 1 predicted as blue
  - 1 predicted as green
  - 18 predicted as red

So, y_true = ['blue'] * 24 + ['green'] * 31 + ['red'] * 20

y_pred = 
- ['blue'] * 19 + ['green'] * 5 (for blue group)
- ['blue'] * 3 + ['green'] * 3 + ['red'] * 25 (for green group)
- ['blue'] * 1 + ['green'] * 1 + ['red'] * 18 (for red group)

So, in order:
- blue group: 19 blue, 5 green
- green group: 3 blue, 3 green, 25 red
- red group: 1 blue, 1 green, 18 red

So, y_pred = 
['blue'] * 19 + ['green'] * 5 + ['blue'] * 3 + ['green'] * 3 + ['red'] * 25 + ['blue'] * 1 + ['green'] * 1 + ['red'] * 18

Let's check the total length:
19 + 5 = 24 (blue group)
3 + 3 + 25 = 31 (green group)
1 + 1 + 18 = 20 (red group)
Total: 24 + 31 + 20 = 75 (matches)

So, the input is:

{
    "y_true": ['blue'] * 24 + ['green'] * 31 + ['red'] * 20,
    "y_pred": ['blue'] * 19 + ['green'] * 5 + ['blue'] * 3 + ['green'] * 3 + ['red'] * 25 + ['blue'] * 1 + ['green'] * 1 + ['red'] * 18
}
