[THOUGHT]
The output is 3.0, which is a simple result. The method calculate parses and evaluates a mathematical expression string. Let's consider what expressions could yield 3.0.

The most basic is "3", but let's check if that's possible:
- If the input is "3", after removing spaces and "=", it remains "3".
- The transform method will not change it.
- The prepare method will process it: since it's not an operator, it will be appended to postfix_stack.
- The calculation will just return float(eval('3')), which is 3.0.

Alternatively, "1+2", "6/2", "7-4", etc., all yield 3.0. But the simplest is "3".

The structure requires the current state of self (postfix_stack and operat_priority). However, the input is before the method runs, so postfix_stack is empty, and operat_priority is the default.

So, the input should be:
- postfix_stack: []
- operat_priority: [0, 3, 2, 1, -1, 1, 0, 2]
- args: expression: "3"
- kwargs: {}
