[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and the function step by step.

1. The output is a numpy array: [1.e-01 1.e+00 1.e+01 1.e+02 1.e+03 1.e+04], which is [0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000].
2. These are all integer powers of 10: 10^-1, 10^0, 10^1, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4.
3. This suggests that the base is 10 (i.e., self._base = 10).
4. The function tick_values computes log_vmin and log_vmax as log(vmin)/log(b) and log(vmax)/log(b).
5. The decades are computed as np.arange(math.floor(log_vmin) - stride, math.ceil(log_vmax) + 2 * stride, stride).
6. The stride is determined by numdec and numticks. If numticks is 'auto', it defaults to 9. Let's try to see what vmin and vmax would be to get these ticks.

Letâ€™s try vmin = 0.1, vmax = 10000:
- log_vmin = log(0.1)/log(10) = -1
- log_vmax = log(10000)/log(10) = 4
- numdec = floor(4) - ceil(-1) = 4 - (-1) = 5

Now, stride:
- If numticks is 'auto', numticks = 9.
- stride = max(ceil(numdec/(numticks-1)), 1) = max(ceil(5/8), 1) = 1

decades = np.arange(floor(-1)-1, ceil(4)+2*1, 1) = np.arange(-2, 6, 1) = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
But the output only shows from 10^-1 to 10^4, i.e., -1 to 4.

But the function then does ticklocs = b ** decades, so ticklocs = 10 ** decades.

But the function also does self.raise_if_exceeds(ticklocs), which likely trims the ticks to those within [vmin, vmax].

So, if we use vmin=0.1, vmax=10000, and base=10, and _subs=1.0 (default), we get the output.

numdecs and numticks are not used directly in the structure, but numticks is.

So, the minimal input is:
- self._base = 10
- self._subs = np.array([1.0]) or just 1.0
- self.numticks = 'auto' (default)
- vmin = 0.1
- vmax = 10000

numdecs is not a field of the class, so we can leave it as null or ignore it.
