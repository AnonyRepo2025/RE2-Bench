Let's analyze the output and the function step by step.

1. **Output shape and values**:
   - The output is a 3x8 numpy array (3 rows, 8 columns).
   - Most values are zero, except for:
     - [0,2] = 0.08546831
     - [2,7] = 0.79366708

2. **What does _sparse_encode do?**
   - It encodes X (samples) using a dictionary (atoms) and a sparse coding algorithm.
   - The output shape is (n_samples, n_components), where n_components = dictionary.shape[0].
   - So, dictionary must have shape (8, n_features), and X must have shape (3, n_features).

3. **Algorithm used**:
   - The default is 'lasso_lars', but let's check if the output matches that.
   - For 'lasso_lars', the code is:
     ```
     lasso_lars = LassoLars(alpha=alpha, ...)
     lasso_lars.fit(dictionary.T, X.T, Xy=cov)
     new_code = lasso_lars.coef_
     ```
   - The output is a 3x8 array, so lasso_lars.coef_ must be (n_samples, n_components).

4. **Values in output**:
   - Only two nonzero values, both positive, and in different rows/columns.
   - This is typical for a sparse code with a high regularization parameter.

5. **What about the input values?**
   - Let's try to reconstruct plausible X and dictionary.
   - Since only [0,2] and [2,7] are nonzero, it suggests that:
     - The first sample (X[0]) is best represented by the 3rd atom (dictionary[2]).
     - The third sample (X[2]) is best represented by the 8th atom (dictionary[7]).
     - The second sample (X[1]) is not well represented by any atom (all zeros).

6. **What could X and dictionary be?**
   - Let's try a simple case: dictionary = np.eye(8), X = np.zeros((3,8)), but that would not produce the observed nonzero values unless X[0,2] and X[2,7] are nonzero.
   - Alternatively, maybe X[0] is a vector with a nonzero at position 2, X[2] at position 7, and X[1] is all zeros.

7. **Let's try:**
   - dictionary = np.eye(8)
   - X = np.zeros((3,8)); X[0,2]=1; X[2,7]=1

8. **What about gram and cov?**
   - gram = np.dot(dictionary, dictionary.T) = identity (since dictionary is identity)
   - cov = np.dot(dictionary, X.T) = X.T

9. **Other parameters:**
   - algorithm: default is 'lasso_lars'
   - regularization: must be high enough to shrink most coefficients to zero, but not so high that all are zero. Let's try regularization=0.1 (as a plausible value).
   - copy_cov: default True
   - init: default None
   - max_iter: default 1000
   - check_input: default True
   - verbose: default 0
   - positive: default False

10. **Check if this matches the output:**
    - With dictionary=identity, X as above, and regularization=0.1, lasso_lars will shrink the coefficients, but not to zero if the input is 1. The nonzero values in the output are less than 1, which matches the effect of L1 regularization.

11. **Conclusion:**
    - X = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]
    - dictionary = np.eye(8)
    - gram = np.eye(8)
    - cov = None (let the function compute it)
    - algorithm = 'lasso_lars'
    - regularization = 0.1
    - copy_cov = True
    - init = None
    - max_iter = 1000
    - check_input = True
    - verbose = 0
    - positive = False
