[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function is FitnessFunc.fit, which takes t, x, sigma as input. It also uses self._fitness_args and self.ncp_prior.
2. The output is an array of four values: [ 4.36037718 48.45689469 52.59791734 99.45505108]. This is the return value of the function, which is edges[change_points].
3. The function computes edges as:
   edges = np.concatenate([t[:1], 0.5 * (t[1:] + t[:-1]), t[-1:]])
   So, edges has length len(t)+1.
4. The function then computes change_points, which is a list of indices into edges, and returns edges[change_points].
5. The output array has 4 values, so change_points has length 4.
6. The values in the output are not integers, so they are not indices, but values from edges.
7. The values are in increasing order, and the last value is 99.45505108, which is likely t[-1] (the last value in t).
8. The first value is 4.36037718, which is likely t[0] (the first value in t).
9. The second and third values are 48.45689469 and 52.59791734, which are likely midpoints between t values, i.e., 0.5*(t[i]+t[i-1]).
10. So, t[0] = 4.36037718, t[-1] = 99.45505108.
11. The midpoints are 48.45689469 and 52.59791734, so there must be t values such that 0.5*(t[i]+t[i-1]) = 48.45689469 and 52.59791734.
12. Let's solve for t[i] and t[i-1]:
    - 0.5*(a+b) = 48.45689469 => a+b = 96.91378938
    - 0.5*(c+d) = 52.59791734 => c+d = 105.19583468
13. Since the midpoints are close together, t must have values around 48 and 53.
14. Let's try t = [4.36037718, a, b, c, d, 99.45505108], but the number of change points is 4, so t probably has 3 or 4 values.
15. The function is likely being used for Bayesian blocks, and the output is the block edges.
16. The function uses self._fitness_args, which is not shown, but likely includes 'T_k', 'N_k', etc.
17. The values of x and sigma are not used in the calculation of edges, only t is.
18. Therefore, the output is determined by t, and x and sigma can be arbitrary (but must be the same length as t).
19. So, t = [4.36037718, a, b, 99.45505108], and the midpoints are 0.5*(a+4.36037718) = 48.45689469, 0.5*(b+a) = 52.59791734.
20. Let's solve for a and b:
    - 0.5*(a+4.36037718) = 48.45689469 => a+4.36037718 = 96.91378938 => a = 96.91378938 - 4.36037718 = 92.5534122
    - 0.5*(b+a) = 52.59791734 => b+a = 105.19583468 => b = 105.19583468 - a = 105.19583468 - 92.5534122 = 12.64242248
    - But this would make b < a, which is odd.
21. Alternatively, perhaps t = [4.36037718, 48.45689469, 52.59791734, 99.45505108], and the midpoints are:
    - 0.5*(48.45689469+4.36037718) = 26.40863544
    - 0.5*(52.59791734+48.45689469) = 50.52740602
    - 0.5*(99.45505108+52.59791734) = 76.02648421
    - So edges = [4.36037718, 26.40863544, 50.52740602, 76.02648421, 99.45505108]
    - But the output is [4.36037718, 48.45689469, 52.59791734, 99.45505108], which matches t exactly.
22. Therefore, the function is returning t itself as the block edges, i.e., change_points = [0,1,2,3], and t = [4.36037718, 48.45689469, 52.59791734, 99.45505108].
23. Therefore, the input t is [4.36037718, 48.45689469, 52.59791734, 99.45505108].
24. x and sigma can be arbitrary, but must be the same length as t, e.g., x = [1,1,1,1], sigma = [1,1,1,1].
25. self.p0, self.gamma, self.ncp_prior can be arbitrary, but ncp_prior is likely None to trigger compute_ncp_prior.
