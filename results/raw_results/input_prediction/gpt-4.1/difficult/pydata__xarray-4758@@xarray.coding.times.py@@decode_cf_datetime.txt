[THOUGHT]
Let's work backwards from the output.

1. The output is a numpy array of datetime64[ns] values, formatted as ISO strings, with times:
   - '1681-05-27T12:00:00.500000000'
   - '1681-05-27T13:00:00.500000000'
   - '1681-05-27T14:00:00.500000000'
   - '1681-05-27T15:00:00.500000000'
   - '1681-05-27T16:00:00.500000000'

2. The times are exactly 1 hour apart, starting at 12:00:00.500, ending at 16:00:00.500, all on 1681-05-27.

3. The function decode_cf_datetime takes num_dates, units, calendar.

4. The function first tries to use pandas decoding if calendar is None or a standard calendar. Let's assume calendar is None or 'standard'.

5. The units string is of the form "<delta> since <ref_date>". The delta is likely "hours", "hour", or "h", and the reference date is "1681-05-27 12:00:00.500".

6. Let's check what num_dates would be for these outputs.

   - If units is "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.500", then:
     - num_dates = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] would yield:
       - 0: 12:00:00.500
       - 1: 13:00:00.500
       - 2: 14:00:00.500
       - 3: 15:00:00.500
       - 4: 16:00:00.500

   - If units is "seconds since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.500", then num_dates would be [0, 3600, 7200, 10800, 14400], but that's less likely.

   - The output matches exactly if units is "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.500" and num_dates is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

7. The calendar is likely None or "standard" (since the year is 1681, which is within the pandas range for standard calendars).

8. Therefore, the input is:
   - num_dates: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
   - units: "hours since 1681-05-27 12:00:00.500"
   - calendar: None
