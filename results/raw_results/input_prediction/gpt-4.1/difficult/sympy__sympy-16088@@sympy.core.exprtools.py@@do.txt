Let's analyze the output and the function step by step.

The output is:
(-1 + "sqrt(3)"*I)*("sqrt(21)" + 5)**(1/3)

This is a product of two terms:
1. (-1 + sqrt(3)*I)
2. (sqrt(21) + 5)^(1/3)

The function `do` is a recursive function used inside `factor_terms`. It factors out content from expressions, especially sums and products, and tries to factor terms in a way that common factors are extracted.

Let's try to reverse-engineer what input would produce this output.

First, note that the output is already factored: it's a product of two terms, and the first term is a sum.

If we look at the code, for a product, `do` will call `as_content_primitive` on the product, which will recursively call `as_content_primitive` on each factor.

For a sum, it will try to factor out common factors.

But in this case, the output is already a product of a sum and a power.

So, what input would produce this output after factoring?

Suppose the input was:
(-1 + sqrt(3)*I)*((sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3))

But if the input was already in this form, the function would just return it, since it would see that the arguments are already in the correct form.

But let's check if the input could be an expanded version.

Suppose the input was:
(-1 + sqrt(3)*I)*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)

If we pass this to `do`, it will check if it's a Basic and not an atom (which it is), then check if it's a Pow, Function, or iterable, or doesn't have `args_cnc`. For a Mul, it will call `as_content_primitive`, which for a Mul will multiply the content of each factor.

For the first factor, (-1 + sqrt(3)*I), as_content_primitive will factor out any content, but since it's a sum, it will try to factor out a GCD, but there is none.

For the second factor, (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3), as_content_primitive will return (1, (sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)).

So the product will remain as is.

Therefore, the input is exactly the same as the output.

Thus, the input to `do` is:
(-1 + sqrt(3)*I)*(sqrt(21) + 5)**(1/3)

In JSON, we need to represent this as a string, since the output is a string.

So, the input is:
"(-1 + \"sqrt(3)\"*I)*(\"sqrt(21)\" + 5)**(1/3)"
