[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and reverse-engineer the input step by step.

1. The output is a tuple:
   - The first element is a regex string: ^(?P"<lang>"[^/]+)\\/(?P"<url>".+)\\/$
   - The second element is a dict: {"lang": {}, "url": {}} (the values are placeholders for converter objects, but in the output they're just empty dicts).

2. Let's focus on the regex:
   - ^(?P"<lang>"[^/]+)\\/(?P"<url>".+)\\/$
   - The ^ and $ are added at the start and end if is_endpoint is True.
   - The regex has two named groups: <lang> and <url>.
   - The first group: (?P"<lang>"[^/]+) corresponds to a path parameter <lang> with converter regex [^/]+ (the default 'str' converter).
   - The second group: (?P"<url>".+) corresponds to a path parameter <url> with converter regex .+ (the 'path' converter).

3. The route string must have two parameters: <lang> and <url>, with <url> using the 'path' converter.
   - The syntax for a path parameter with a converter is <converter:name>.
   - So, <lang> (no converter specified, so default 'str'), and <path:url> (explicit 'path' converter).

4. The static parts of the regex are \/, which means the route string must have a slash between the parameters and at the end.
   - The route string must be: "<lang>/<path:url>/"

5. is_endpoint must be True, because the regex ends with $.

6. Therefore, the input is:
   - route: "<lang>/<path:url>/"
   - is_endpoint: True
