[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function in question is `SlicedLowLevelWCS.world_to_pixel_values`. The output is a list of two floats, both very close to zero (on the order of 1e-12 and 1e-13). This suggests that the world coordinates provided as input correspond to pixel coordinates very close to (0, 0) after all the slicing and WCS transformations.

2. The function works as follows:
   - It first computes `sliced_out_world_coords` by calling `_pixel_to_world_values_all` with zeros for each pixel axis that is kept (i.e., `[0] * len(self._pixel_keep)`).
   - Then, it builds `world_arrays_new` by inserting the input world coordinates at the indices in `_world_keep`, and filling the rest with the corresponding values from `sliced_out_world_coords`.
   - It then calls the underlying WCS's `world_to_pixel_values` with these `world_arrays_new`.
   - After that, it adjusts the pixel values by subtracting the start of the slice (if any) for each pixel axis.
   - Finally, it returns the pixel values for the kept pixel axes.

3. The output is two values, so `self.pixel_n_dim == 2` and `self._wcs.pixel_n_dim > 1`. This means that `_pixel_keep` is likely `[0, 1]` (i.e., both axes are kept).

4. The output values are extremely close to zero, which suggests that the world coordinates provided as input correspond to the reference pixel (CRPIX) in the WCS, or at least to the origin in pixel space.

5. The default behavior of WCS is that the reference pixel (CRPIX) maps to the reference world coordinate (CRVAL). If the WCS is set up such that CRPIX = (0, 0) and CRVAL = (0, 0), then inputting world coordinates (0, 0) should yield pixel coordinates (0, 0).

6. Since the output is so close to zero, it's likely that the input world coordinates were both zero.

7. The structure of the input requires us to fill in:
   - `self._wcs._init_kwargs.keysel` and `colsel`: These are not relevant for the output, so we can set them to `null`.
   - `self._wcs.naxis`, `_naxis`: Since there are two output values, both should be 2.
   - `self._wcs._pixel_bounds`: Not relevant for the output, can be `null`.
   - `self._slices_array`, `_slices_pixel`: If both axes are kept, then `_slices_pixel` is `[slice(None), slice(None)]` and `_pixel_keep` is `[0, 1]`.
   - `_world_keep`: If both axes are kept, then `[0, 1]`.

8. The function is called with positional arguments, so the input world coordinates are the arguments. Since the output is two values, the input must have been two world coordinates, both zero.

9. Therefore, the input is:
   - `args`: `[0.0, 0.0]`
   - All other fields as above.
