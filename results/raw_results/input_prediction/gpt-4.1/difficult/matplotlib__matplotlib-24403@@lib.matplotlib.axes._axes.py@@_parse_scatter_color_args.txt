Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

The function signature is:
```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func)
```
The output is:
```
[
    "b",
    "[[0. 0. 1. 1.]]",
    "r"
]
```
So, the return is (c, colors, edgecolors).

Let's break down what these mean:
- "b" is the value of c returned.
- "[[0. 0. 1. 1.]]" is the value of colors returned (as a string, but in code it would be a numpy array).
- "r" is the value of edgecolors returned.

Let's see how to get this output.

1. The function first pops 'facecolors' and 'facecolor' from kwargs, then 'edgecolor' and 'color'.
2. If 'color' is not None and c is not None, it raises an error. If 'color' is not None, it sets edgecolors and facecolors to 'color' if they are None.
3. If edgecolors is None and not classic mode, it sets edgecolors to mpl.rcParams['scatter.edgecolors'].
4. If c is None, it sets c to facecolors if not None, else 'b' (if classic mode) or get_next_color_func().
5. If c is not None and not a string or sequence of strings, it tries to convert c to a float array and checks its shape.
6. If not c_is_mapped, it tries to convert c to RGBA array.

Now, let's try to reconstruct the input.

First, the output c is "b". That means after all the logic, c is "b".

Second, colors is "[[0. 0. 1. 1.]]". This is the RGBA for blue, so mcolors.to_rgba_array("b") returns [[0, 0, 1, 1]].

Third, edgecolors is "r".

So, edgecolors is "r" at the end.

Let's try to reconstruct the input step by step.

- If c is None, and facecolors is None, and classic_mode is False, c will be get_next_color_func(). But here c is "b", so either classic_mode is True, or facecolors is None and get_next_color_func() returns "b".
- But in the code, if c is None, and facecolors is None, and classic_mode is True, c = "b".
- But in modern matplotlib, classic_mode is False by default, so unless we set it, c would be get_next_color_func().
- But let's assume classic_mode is True for this test, or get_next_color_func returns "b".

But let's look at edgecolors. The only way edgecolors is "r" is if it is passed in as "r", or as a kwarg.

In the code, edgecolors is set to kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors). So if edgecolors is None, and kwargs has 'edgecolor', it will be set to that.

But in the input structure, edgecolors is a positional argument, and kwargs is an empty dict.

So, edgecolors must be "r" in the input.

Now, c is None in the input, because in the code, if c is None, it sets c to facecolors if not None, else 'b' (if classic_mode) or get_next_color_func().

But in the output, c is "b", so c must have been None in the input, and facecolors must have been None, and classic_mode must be True, or get_next_color_func() returns "b".

But in the input structure, kwargs is empty, so facecolors is not set.

So, c = None, edgecolors = "r", kwargs = {}, xsize = XXX, get_next_color_func = {}.

Now, xsize is used to check the length of c, but since c is "b", mcolors.to_rgba_array("b") returns a (1,4) array, so xsize can be any value, but for the shape check, len(colors) must be in (0, 1, xsize). Since len(colors) == 1, xsize can be any value >= 1.

So, let's pick xsize = 1.

get_next_color_func is not used, because c is set to "b" due to classic_mode being True.

So, the input is:
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "c": null,
        "edgecolors": "r",
        "kwargs": {}
    },
    "kwargs": {
        "xsize": 1,
        "get_next_color_func": {}
    }
}
