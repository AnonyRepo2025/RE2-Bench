Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The output is a 1x1 numpy array with value 1.1649954. This means X and Y are both 1 sample with the same number of features.

2. The function computes the Euclidean distance between X and Y. If squared=False (the default), it returns the square root of the sum of squared differences.

3. Let's denote X = [[a, b, ...]], Y = [[c, d, ...]]. The Euclidean distance is sqrt((a-c)^2 + (b-d)^2 + ...).

4. The output is 1.1649954. So, (a-c)^2 + (b-d)^2 + ... = (1.1649954)^2 = 1.3582 (rounded).

5. Let's try a simple 1D case: X = [[x]], Y = [[y]]. Then sqrt((x-y)^2) = 1.1649954, so |x-y| = 1.1649954. Let's try x=0, y=1.1649954. That would work.

6. But let's check if the function could have more than 1 feature. Let's try 2D: (a-c)^2 + (b-d)^2 = 1.3582. Let's try a=1, b=0, c=0, d=1. Then (1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2, sqrt(2) = 1.4142, which is too high.

7. Let's try a=1, b=0, c=0, d=0. Then (1-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 = 1, sqrt(1) = 1.0, too low.

8. Let's try a=1, b=0.5, c=0, d=0. Then (1-0)^2 + (0.5-0)^2 = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25, sqrt(1.25) = 1.118, still a bit low.

9. Let's try a=1, b=0.75, c=0, d=0. Then (1-0)^2 + (0.75-0)^2 = 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625, sqrt(1.5625) = 1.25, a bit high.

10. Let's try a=1, b=0.5, c=0, d=0.5. (1-0)^2 + (0.5-0.5)^2 = 1 + 0 = 1, sqrt(1) = 1.

11. Let's try a=1, b=0.75, c=0, d=0.25. (1-0)^2 + (0.75-0.25)^2 = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25, sqrt(1.25) = 1.118.

12. Let's try a=1, b=0.9, c=0, d=0.3. (1-0)^2 + (0.9-0.3)^2 = 1 + 0.36 = 1.36, sqrt(1.36) = 1.166, which is very close.

13. So, X = [[1, 0.9]], Y = [[0, 0.3]] gives sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0.9-0.3)^2) = sqrt(1 + 0.36) = sqrt(1.36) = 1.166190, which is very close to 1.1649954.

14. Let's try to get even closer. Let's solve for b: (1-0)^2 + (b-0.3)^2 = 1.3582, so (b-0.3)^2 = 1.3582 - 1 = 0.3582, so b-0.3 = sqrt(0.3582) = 0.5985, so b = 0.8985.

15. So, X = [[1, 0.8985]], Y = [[0, 0.3]].

16. Let's check: (1-0)^2 + (0.8985-0.3)^2 = 1 + (0.5985)^2 = 1 + 0.3582 = 1.3582, sqrt(1.3582) = 1.165.

17. This matches the output almost exactly (1.1649954).

18. The function's default for squared is False, so squared=False.

19. Therefore, the input is:
X = [[1, 0.8985]]
Y = [[0, 0.3]]
squared = False
