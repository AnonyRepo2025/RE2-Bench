[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and the output.

The code reads four integers from input: H, W, A, B.

It then creates an HxW grid, and fills it according to the following rules:
- For each cell (i, j):
    - If i < B:
        - If j < A: answer[i][j] = '0'
        - else: answer[i][j] = '1'
    - else (i >= B):
        - If j < A: answer[i][j] = '1'
        - else: answer[i][j] = '0'

Then, it prints each row as a string.

The output is a huge block of text, with 1000 lines, each of length 1000, and the first 500 lines are all '1's, the next 500 lines are all '0's.

Let's check the first few lines:
- The first 500 lines are all '1's, each of length 1000.
- The next 500 lines are all '0's, each of length 1000.

So, the output is a 1000x1000 grid, with the first 500 rows all '1's, and the next 500 rows all '0's.

Let's see what input would produce this.

Let H = 1000, W = 1000.

We need to find A and B such that:
- For i in 0..999, for j in 0..999:
    - If i < B:
        - If j < A: answer[i][j] = '0'
        - else: answer[i][j] = '1'
    - else:
        - If j < A: answer[i][j] = '1'
        - else: answer[i][j] = '0'

But in the output, for i in 0..499, all answer[i][j] = '1'
for i in 500..999, all answer[i][j] = '0'

So, for i < 500, all answer[i][j] = '1'
for i >= 500, all answer[i][j] = '0'

Let's check what values of A and B would produce this.

First, for i < B:
    - If j < A: answer[i][j] = '0'
    - else: answer[i][j] = '1'

But in the output, for i < 500, all answer[i][j] = '1'
So, for i < 500, for all j, answer[i][j] = '1'
But in the code, for i < B, for j < A, answer[i][j] = '0'
So, to have all '1's, we need A = 0, so that the 'if j < A' branch is never taken, and all answer[i][j] = '1'

But let's check for i >= B:
    - If j < A: answer[i][j] = '1'
    - else: answer[i][j] = '0'

For i >= 500, all answer[i][j] = '0'
So, for i >= 500, for all j, answer[i][j] = '0'
But in the code, for j < A, answer[i][j] = '1'
So, to have all '0's, we need A = 0, so that the 'if j < A' branch is never taken, and all answer[i][j] = '0'

So, A = 0

Now, what about B?
For i < B, the first 500 rows, so B = 500

So, the input is:
H = 1000
W = 1000
A = 0
B = 500

So, the input is "1000 1000 0 500"
