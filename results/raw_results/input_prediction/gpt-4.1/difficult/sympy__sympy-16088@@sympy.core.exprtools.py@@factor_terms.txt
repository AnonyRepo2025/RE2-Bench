[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and the function step by step.

1. The output is the string "R3 + R4 + 4050". In SymPy, this would be an expression: R3 + R4 + 4050, where R3 and R4 are likely symbols.

2. The function `factor_terms` is designed to factor out common terms in an expression, but if the expression is already in its simplest additive form, it will just return the sum.

3. The function first sympifies the input, so the input could be a string, a SymPy expression, or a Python expression that can be sympified to R3 + R4 + 4050.

4. The output is not factored further, so the input must be an expression that, after factoring, results in R3 + R4 + 4050. 

5. Let's consider what kind of input would be transformed into this output. If the input was, for example, R3 + R4 + 4050, then the output would be the same, since there is nothing to factor.

6. If the input was something like 4050 + R3 + R4, or R4 + 4050 + R3, the output would still be R3 + R4 + 4050, since SymPy sorts the terms.

7. If the input was something like 2025*2 + R3 + R4, then factor_terms would compute 2025*2 = 4050, and the output would be R3 + R4 + 4050.

8. Let's check if the function would combine numbers: yes, because sympify and Add would combine constants.

9. Therefore, the input could be any expression that, when simplified, gives R3 + R4 + 4050. The most "raw" input that would demonstrate the function's effect is 2025*2 + R3 + R4.

10. The function does not require any special kwargs, so kwargs is {}.

11. The "self" is not used (factor_terms is a standalone function), so self is {}.

12. The input structure is:
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "expr": XXX
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}

13. Therefore, the input could be:
"2025*2 + R3 + R4"
or
"R3 + R4 + 2025*2"

But since the output is sorted as R3 + R4 + 4050, let's use "2025*2 + R3 + R4" to show the effect of combining numbers.

14. Alternatively, the input could be a list or tuple, but the most natural is a string or sympy expression.

15. Since the function sympifies the input, a string is acceptable.

16. Final answer: expr = "2025*2 + R3 + R4"
