[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function is `Nominal._setup(self, data, prop, axis=None)`.
2. The output shows all attributes as null or empty:
   - "values": null
   - "order": null
   - "_tick_params": {"locator": null}
   - "_label_params": {"formatter": null}
   - "_legend": [null, null]
   - "_matplotlib_scale": {}
   - "_pipeline": null
   - "_spacer": {}

3. The function starts by copying `self` to `new`. If `_tick_params` is None, it calls `tick()`, and if `_label_params` is None, it calls `label()`. But in the output, both are not None, but their contents are null, so likely the input had `_tick_params` and `_label_params` as dicts with null values.

4. The function computes `units_seed = categorical_order(data, new.order)`. If `data` or `order` is None, `units_seed` will be None or empty. The output shows "_legend": [null, null], which means `units_seed` is None.

5. The function creates a `CatScale` and assigns it to `_matplotlib_scale`. The output shows an empty dict for this, suggesting that the scale was created but is empty (possibly a mock or placeholder).

6. The function sets up a pipeline and a spacer, but in the output, both are null or empty, suggesting that the function did not proceed to set them up, likely because `units_seed` is None.

7. The input structure for `self` should have:
   - "values": null
   - "order": null
   - "_tick_params": {"locator": null}
   - "_label_params": {"formatter": null}
   - "_legend": [null, null]

8. The input for `data` should be a pandas Series with all fields as null or empty, and its "_name" as null, to match the lack of units_seed.

9. The input for `prop` should have "variable": null, to match the lack of legend and mapping.

10. The rest of the fields in the structure can be filled with null or empty values as appropriate.
