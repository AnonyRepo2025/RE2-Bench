[THOUGHT]
The `solve` method returns a list of moves to reach the goal state from the initial state. If the output is an empty list (`[]`), it means that the initial state is already the same as the goal state, so no moves are needed.

Looking at the class, the goal state is always:
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]

Therefore, for the output to be `[]`, the `initial_state` must also be:
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]

The `goal_state` is set in the constructor and is always the same as above.

So, the input should have:
"initial_state": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]
"goal_state": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]
"args": {} (no arguments)
"kwargs": {} (no keyword arguments)
