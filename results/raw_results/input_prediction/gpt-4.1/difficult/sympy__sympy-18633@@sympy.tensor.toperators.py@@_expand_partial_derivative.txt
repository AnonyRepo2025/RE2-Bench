[THOUGHT]
We are given the output of the `_expand_partial_derivative` method, which is a dictionary with all fields (`_indices`, `_free`, `_dum`) set to null. This suggests that the method returned `S.Zero` (i.e., the sympy zero object), because in the code:

```python
if not args[0].free_symbols:
    return S.Zero
```

This is the only branch that returns a non-object (i.e., not a PartialDerivative or TensAdd/TensMul), and thus the only way the output would be a dict with all nulls (since S.Zero does not have these attributes).

Therefore, for this to happen, `args[0].free_symbols` must be empty. `args[0]` is the expression being differentiated, i.e., `self.expr`. So, `self.expr` must be a sympy object with no free symbols.

The other attributes (`_indices`, `_free`, `_dum`) are not used in this branch, so their values in the input do not matter for the output.

Thus, the input should be a PartialDerivative object (i.e., `self`) whose `.expr` is a sympy object with no free symbols (e.g., a number like 1 or 0), and whose `_indices`, `_free`, `_dum` can be anything (but to match the output, we set them to null).
