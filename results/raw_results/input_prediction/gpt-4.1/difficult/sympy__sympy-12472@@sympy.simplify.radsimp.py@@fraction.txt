Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function `fraction(expr, exact=False)` takes an expression and splits it into a numerator and denominator, returning them as a tuple (numer, denom). If `exact` is False (the default), it tries to collect all negative powers and rational denominators into the denominator.

2. The output is:
```
{
    "output": [
        "-x**3",
        "1"
    ]
}
```
So, the numerator is "-x**3" and the denominator is "1".

3. This means that the input expression, when passed through `fraction`, is sympified to an expression whose numerator is "-x**3" and denominator is 1.

4. Let's see what kind of input would produce this. The function splits the expression into Mul arguments, and for each term, if it's a negative power, it goes to the denominator, otherwise to the numerator. Rational numbers are split into their numer/denom.

5. If the input is simply `-x**3`, then:
   - Mul.make_args(-x**3) returns (-1, x**3)
   - -1 is Rational, so n=-1, d=1, so numer.append(-1), denom.append(1)
   - x**3 is a positive power, so numer.append(x**3)
   - So numer = [-1, x**3], denom = [1]
   - Mul(*numer) = -x**3, Mul(*denom) = 1

6. Therefore, the input expression is "-x**3".

7. Let's check if any other input could produce this. For example, "-1*x**3" or "-(x**3)" or "-x*x*x". All of these, when sympified, become "-x**3".

8. So, the minimal input is "-x**3".
