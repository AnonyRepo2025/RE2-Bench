Let's analyze the output and the function step by step.

1. The output is a list of two expressions: "3*t_0 - 5" and "2*t_0 - 5". These are parametric solutions in terms of t_0.
2. The function diop_solve first calls classify_diop(eq, _dict=False). If the type is 'linear', it calls _diop_linear(var, coeff, param).
3. For a linear Diophantine equation in two variables, the general solution is of the form x = a*t + b, y = c*t + d, where t is an integer parameter.
4. The output matches this: x = 3*t_0 - 5, y = 2*t_0 - 5.
5. Let's try to reconstruct the equation. For a linear equation ax + by + c = 0, the general solution is:
   - x = (b/gcd)*t + x0
   - y = (-a/gcd)*t + y0
   But the actual coefficients can be different depending on the equation.
6. Let's denote the variables as x and y. The parametric solution is:
   - x = 3*t_0 - 5
   - y = 2*t_0 - 5
7. Let's try to find an equation that has this general solution. Let's substitute x and y into a general linear equation:
   Suppose the equation is: a*x + b*y + c = 0
   Substitute x and y:
   a*(3*t_0 - 5) + b*(2*t_0 - 5) + c = 0
   (3a + 2b)*t_0 + (-5a - 5b + c) = 0
   For this to be true for all t_0, the coefficient of t_0 must be zero, and the constant term must be zero:
   3a + 2b = 0
   -5a - 5b + c = 0
8. Solve 3a + 2b = 0 => a = -2b/3
   Let's pick b = 3, then a = -2
   Now, -5a - 5b + c = 0
   -5*(-2) - 5*3 + c = 0
   10 - 15 + c = 0
   c = 5
9. So the equation is: a*x + b*y + c = 0
   a = -2, b = 3, c = 5
   -2*x + 3*y + 5 = 0
   Or, rearranged: 3*y - 2*x + 5 = 0
   Or: 3*y - 2*x = -5
   Or: 2*x - 3*y = 5
10. Let's check if the parametric solution fits:
    x = 3*t_0 - 5
    y = 2*t_0 - 5
    2*x - 3*y = 2*(3*t_0 - 5) - 3*(2*t_0 - 5) = (6*t_0 - 10) - (6*t_0 - 15) = (6*t_0 - 10) - 6*t_0 + 15 = -10 + 15 = 5
    Yes, it fits.
11. Therefore, the input equation is: 2*x - 3*y - 5 = 0, or 2*x - 3*y = 5.
12. In SymPy, the variables are usually symbols x and y.
13. So, the input should be eq = 2*x - 3*y - 5, where x and y are sympy.Symbols.
