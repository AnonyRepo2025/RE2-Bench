[THOUGHT]
The function check_winner scans the board for any sequence of 5 identical non-space symbols ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal. If it finds such a sequence, it returns the symbol ('X' or 'O') that has five in a row.

The output is "O", so there must be a sequence of exactly five 'O's in a row, column, or diagonal somewhere on the board.

The board_size can be any value >= 5, but the minimal example is 5. Let's use a 5x5 board for simplicity.

We need to construct a board where 'O' has five in a row, and the rest can be spaces or any other symbol, but to keep it minimal, let's use spaces.

For example, a horizontal win for 'O' in the first row:
[
    ['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
    [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
    [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
    [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
    [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']
]

current_player can be either 'X' or 'O', but it doesn't affect the check_winner result.

So, the input should be:
- board_size: 5
- board: as above
- current_player: any (let's use 'X')
- args: {}
- kwargs: {}
