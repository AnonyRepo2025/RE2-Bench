Let's analyze the function step by step to determine what input would produce the output "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00".

1. The function `_sqlite_datetime_parse(dt, tzname=None, conn_tzname=None)` takes a string `dt` (or None), and two optional timezone names.
2. If `dt` is None, returns None. So `dt` must not be None.
3. It tries to parse `dt` using `backend_utils.typecast_timestamp(dt)`. This function expects a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.microseconds][+/-TZ]" or "YYYY-MM-DD".
4. If parsing fails, returns None. So `dt` must be a valid timestamp string.
5. If `conn_tzname` is provided, it sets the tzinfo of the datetime to that timezone.
6. If `tzname` is provided and is different from `conn_tzname`, it tries to adjust the datetime to the new timezone, possibly parsing a "+HH:MM" or "-HH:MM" offset.
7. Finally, it calls `timezone.localtime(dt, pytz.timezone(tzname))` if `tzname` is not None and different from `conn_tzname`.

Now, the output is "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00", which is a datetime with UTC timezone.

Let's try the simplest case:
- If `dt` is "2016-06-13 00:00:00", and both `tzname` and `conn_tzname` are None, then:
    - `typecast_timestamp` will parse it as a naive datetime (no tzinfo).
    - Since `conn_tzname` is None, no tzinfo is set.
    - Since `tzname` is None, the block that adjusts timezones is skipped.
    - The function returns a naive datetime, not an aware one.
    - The output would be "2016-06-13 00:00:00" (no +00:00).

But the output is "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00", which is an aware datetime in UTC.

How does the function produce an aware datetime?
- If `conn_tzname` is "UTC", then after parsing, it sets tzinfo to pytz.timezone("UTC"), making the datetime aware.
- If `tzname` is also "UTC", then the block that adjusts timezones is skipped (since tzname == conn_tzname).
- The function returns the aware datetime in UTC.

So, the input should be:
- dt: "2016-06-13 00:00:00"
- tzname: "UTC"
- conn_tzname: "UTC"

Alternatively, if `dt` is "2016-06-13 00:00:00+00:00", then `typecast_timestamp` will parse the offset and set tzinfo to UTC, and the rest of the function will not change it.

But in Django's typecast_timestamp, the offset is not handled as a timezone-aware datetime, but as a string split. So the safest is to use the first approach.

Therefore, the input is:
- dt: "2016-06-13 00:00:00"
- tzname: "UTC"
- conn_tzname: "UTC"
