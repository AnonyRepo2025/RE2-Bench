[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the logic of `check_winner`:

1. It calculates the value of both hands using `calculate_hand_value`.
2. If both values > 21:
   - If player_value <= dealer_value: "Player wins"
   - Else: "Dealer wins"
3. If only player_value > 21: "Dealer wins"
4. If only dealer_value > 21: "Player wins"
5. If both <= 21:
   - If player_value <= dealer_value: "Dealer wins"
   - Else: "Player wins"

We want the output to be "Player wins". This can happen in two cases:
- Dealer busts (dealer_value > 21, player_value <= 21)
- Both bust, but player_value <= dealer_value

Let's pick the simplest: dealer busts, player does not.

Let's construct hands:
- Player: ["10H", "7D"] → 10+7=17 (no aces)
- Dealer: ["KH", "9D", "5S"] → 10+9+5=24 (>21, bust)

Now, for the structure:
- self.deck: can be anything (not used in this function)
- self.player_hand: can be same as args.player_hand
- self.dealer_hand: can be same as args.dealer_hand

So, fill in accordingly.
