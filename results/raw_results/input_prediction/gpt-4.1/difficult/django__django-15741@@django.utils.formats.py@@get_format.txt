Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function is `get_format(format_type, lang=None, use_l10n=None)`.
2. The output is `"jS \\o\\f F"`, which is a typical Django default for the `DATE_FORMAT` setting.
3. The function first checks if `use_l10n` is None, and if so, tries to get it from `settings._USE_L10N_INTERNAL` or `settings.USE_L10N`.
4. If `use_l10n` is True, it tries to get the format from format modules for the language. If not found, or if `use_l10n` is False, it falls back to `getattr(settings, format_type)`.
5. If `format_type` is not in `FORMAT_SETTINGS`, it just returns the string passed in.
6. The output is `"jS \\o\\f F"`, which is the default Django `DATE_FORMAT` (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#date-format).
7. If `use_l10n` is False, the function will return `getattr(settings, format_type)`, which is the default value for `DATE_FORMAT` unless overridden.
8. If `use_l10n` is True, it would try to get a localized format, but if not found, it would also fall back to the default.
9. However, the most direct way to get this output is to call `get_format("DATE_FORMAT", use_l10n=False)`.

Therefore:
- `format_type` should be `"DATE_FORMAT"`
- `use_l10n` should be `False`
