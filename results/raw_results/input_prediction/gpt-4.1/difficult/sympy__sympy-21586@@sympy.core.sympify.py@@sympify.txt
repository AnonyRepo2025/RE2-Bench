[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output:

The output is:
```
{
    "_args_set": "{'2.00000000000000', '3'}"
}
```
This suggests that the result of `sympify(a)` is an object whose `_args_set` attribute is the string representation of the set `{'2.00000000000000', '3'}`.

But `sympify` does not return an object with `_args_set` attribute by default. However, in SymPy, expressions like `sympify("2,3")` or `sympify([2,3])` can result in a tuple or list of sympified numbers, but those do not have `_args_set` attributes.

But, if the input is a set, e.g., `{2, 3}`, then `sympify` will try to sympify each element, resulting in a set of sympified numbers. In SymPy, the string representation of a sympified integer is just the integer, but for floats, it is a string with many zeros, e.g., `2.00000000000000`.

So, if the input is `{2.0, 3}`, then after sympification, the set will contain a SymPy Float and a SymPy Integer. The string representation of the Float is `'2.00000000000000'`, and the Integer is `'3'`.

Therefore, the input `a` must be a set containing `2.0` and `3`, i.e., `{2.0, 3}`.

Alternatively, if the input is a list or tuple, the output would be a list or tuple, not a set.

Thus, the input is:
```
{
    "a": {2.0, 3}
}
```
