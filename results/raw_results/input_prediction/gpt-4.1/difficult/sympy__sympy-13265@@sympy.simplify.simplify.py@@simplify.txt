[THOUGHT]
The function `simplify` is a general-purpose symbolic simplifier from SymPy. The output is "50", which is a simple integer. Let's reason about what input could produce this output.

1. The function first calls `sympify(expr)`, which converts the input to a SymPy expression. If the input is already a number (like 50), it will just return that number.
2. The function then tries to call `_eval_simplify` on the expression, but for a number, this will not do anything.
3. The function then checks if the expression is a `Basic` instance and if it has arguments. For an integer, it will not have arguments, so it will return the expression as is.

Therefore, if the input is "50", the output will be "50".

Alternatively, if the input is an expression that simplifies to 50, such as "25 + 25", "100/2", "5*10", etc., the output will also be "50".

But since the output is just "50" (not an expression), the simplest and most direct input is the integer 50 itself.

Thus, the input should be:
{
    "expr": 50
}
