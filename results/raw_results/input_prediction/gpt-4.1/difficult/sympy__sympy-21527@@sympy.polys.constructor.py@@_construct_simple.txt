[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `_construct_simple` and the output.

The output is:
```
{
    "output": [
        {},
        null
    ]
}
```
So, the function returned a tuple: ({}, None).

Let's see under what conditions this can happen.

1. The function starts by initializing several flags and an empty list `float_numbers`.
2. It defines `is_algebraic` depending on `opt.extension`.
3. It loops over `coeffs`:
    - If `coeff.is_Rational`:
        - If not integer, sets `rationals = True`
    - If `coeff.is_Float`:
        - If `algebraics` is True, returns False
        - else, sets `floats = True` and appends to `float_numbers`
    - Else:
        - Calls `pure_complex(coeff)`
        - If is_complex:
            - sets `complexes = True`
            - If both x and y are rational, and not both integer, sets `rationals = True`
            - else, sets `floats = True` and appends floats
        - elif is_algebraic(coeff):
            - If floats, returns False
            - else, sets `algebraics = True`
        - else:
            - returns None

So, the only way for `_construct_simple` to return None is if a coefficient is not rational, not float, not pure complex, and not algebraic (according to the lambda).

But in our case, the function returns a tuple: ({}, None).

Looking further, after the loop, it computes `max_prec` and then:

- If `algebraics` is True:
    - calls `_construct_algebraic(coeffs, opt)` and returns its result
- else:
    - sets `domain` depending on the flags
    - sets `result = [domain.from_sympy(coeff) for coeff in coeffs]`
    - returns (domain, result)

So, the only way for the second element of the tuple to be None is if `result = [domain.from_sympy(coeff) for coeff in coeffs]` is [None], or if `coeffs` is empty, so result is [].

But in the output, the second element is null (i.e., None), not an empty list.

Wait, but the output is:
```
[
    {},
    null
]
```
So, the domain is an empty dict, and the result is None.

But in the code, `result` is always a list (unless algebraics is True, in which case it returns whatever `_construct_algebraic` returns).

But if the function returns None early, it just returns None, not a tuple.

So, the only way to get ({}, None) is if `domain` is an empty dict and `result` is None.

But in the code, `domain` is always set to one of the domain objects (e.g., QQ, ZZ, etc.), never an empty dict.

So, perhaps the domain is a mock or a placeholder, or the input is such that the function returns (domain, None).

But in the code, `result` is always a list, unless an exception is raised in `domain.from_sympy(coeff)`.

But if `coeffs` is empty, then `result` is an empty list, not None.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is being called with an empty list for `coeffs`, and the domain is a dummy object ({}), and the result is None.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is being called with a coefficient that triggers the `else: return None` branch in the loop, but in that case, the function returns None, not a tuple.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is being called with a coefficient that triggers the `if algebraics: domain, result = _construct_algebraic(coeffs, opt)`, and `_construct_algebraic` returns ({}, None).

So, perhaps the input is such that `algebraics` is True, and `_construct_algebraic` returns ({}, None).

Therefore, the input should be such that at least one coefficient is algebraic, and `opt.extension` is True.

So, let's set `opt.extension = True`, and `coeffs` contains at least one algebraic number.

For example, `coeffs = [sqrt(2)]`, where sqrt(2) is algebraic.

Then, in the loop:
- For sqrt(2):
    - Not rational, not float
    - pure_complex(sqrt(2)) returns None
    - is_algebraic(sqrt(2)) is True
    - floats is False, so sets algebraics = True

After the loop, algebraics is True, so calls `_construct_algebraic(coeffs, opt)`, which returns ({}, None).

Therefore, the input is:
- coeffs: [sqrt(2)]
- opt: {"extension": True}
