Let's analyze the output and the code step by step.

1. The output is a sparse matrix in CSC format, with:
   - shape: (2, 5)
   - indptr: [0 4 9] (so 2 columns, first column has 4 elements, second has 5)
   - indices: [1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4] (row indices for the nonzero values)
   - data: [2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18] (the nonzero values)

2. The transform method in SelectorMixin:
   - Calls self._validate_data(X, ...) which will return X as a sparse matrix if it is one.
   - Calls self._transform(X)
   - _transform calls self.get_support(), which returns a boolean mask of selected features.
   - If mask.any() is True, it returns _safe_indexing(X, mask, axis=1), i.e., selects columns where mask is True.

3. The output is a sparse matrix with 5 columns, so the mask must have 5 True values (i.e., all features are selected).

4. The input X must be a sparse matrix with shape (2, 5), and the output is just X itself (since all columns are selected).

5. The data, indices, and indptr in the output must match those in the input, since no columns are dropped.

6. The self object must have n_features_in_ = 5 (number of input features), and step can be anything (not used in transform).

Therefore, the input X is a sparse matrix with the same shape, data, indices, and indptr as the output.
