Let's analyze the output and the function step by step.

1. The output is:
```
Attributes:
    foo:      bar
```
This means:
- The title is "Attributes".
- There is a mapping with a single key "foo" and value "bar".
- The summarizer function, when called with ("foo", bar, col_width), must return "    foo:      bar".

2. The function _mapping_repr:
- It takes mapping, title, summarizer, expand_option_name, col_width, max_rows.
- If col_width is None, it is calculated as max(len(str(s)) for s in mapping) or 0, then max(max_name_length, 7) + 6.
- If mapping is not empty, len_mapping = 1.
- _get_boolean_with_default(expand_option_name, default=True) must return True (otherwise, the output would be "Attributes: (1)").
- len_mapping <= max_rows (default 12), so it just adds the summarizer output for each item.

3. The summarizer function must format the key and value as "    foo:      bar" (with spaces for alignment).
- This matches the default summarize_attr function in xarray, which is:
```python
def summarize_attr(name, value, col_width):
    return pretty_print(name, col_width) + repr(value)
```
- pretty_print("foo", col_width) pads "foo" to col_width, then adds repr(value).
- repr("bar") is 'bar' (without quotes if value is not a string? But in xarray, it's just bar).

4. The expand_option_name is "display_expand_attrs" for attributes_repr.

5. Therefore, the input mapping is {"foo": "bar"}, title is "Attributes", summarizer is summarize_attr, expand_option_name is "display_expand_attrs".
