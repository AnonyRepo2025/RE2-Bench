Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `urlencode` takes a `query` argument and an optional `doseq` argument (defaults to False).
2. If `query` is a `MultiValueDict`, it is converted to a sequence of (key, value) pairs using `.lists()`.
3. If `query` has an `items` attribute, it is converted to a sequence of (key, value) pairs using `.items()`.
4. For each (key, value) pair:
   - If value is None, raise TypeError.
   - If not doseq or value is a string/bytes, use value as is.
   - If doseq is True and value is a sequence, iterate over it, convert each item to string if not bytes, and collect into a list.
5. The result is passed to `original_urlencode(query_params, doseq)`.

Given the output "a=1&b=2&c=3", this is the standard URL encoding for a dictionary: {"a": "1", "b": "2", "c": "3"}.

- If the input was a dict: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}, the output would be the same, as values are converted to strings.
- If the input was a list of pairs: [("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)], the output would also be the same.
- If the input was a MultiValueDict with single values: {"a": [1], "b": [2], "c": [3]}, and doseq=True, the output would be the same.

But since doseq is not set, and the output is the simplest form, the most direct input is a dict: {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}.

Therefore, the input should be:
{
    "query": {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
}
