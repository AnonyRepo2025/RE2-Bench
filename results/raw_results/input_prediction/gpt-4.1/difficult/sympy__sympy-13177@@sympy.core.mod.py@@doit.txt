[THOUGHT]
We are given the output "nan" from the function doit(p, q) inside Mod.eval. We need to find values of p and q such that doit(p, q) returns nan.

Let's look at the code for doit:

```
def doit(p, q):
    if p.is_infinite or q.is_infinite or p is nan or (q is nan):
        return nan
    ...
```

So, the very first condition is: if either p or q is infinite, or p is nan, or q is nan, then return nan.

Therefore, any of the following will work:
- p is nan
- q is nan
- p is infinite
- q is infinite

The simplest is to set p = nan, q = anything (say, 1), or vice versa.

Since the output is the string "nan", it's likely that p or q is nan.

In SymPy, nan is a singleton object: sympy.core.numbers.nan

So, the input should be:
- p: nan
- q: 1 (or any number)

Alternatively, q: nan, p: 1

Either is valid. Let's pick p: nan, q: 1.
