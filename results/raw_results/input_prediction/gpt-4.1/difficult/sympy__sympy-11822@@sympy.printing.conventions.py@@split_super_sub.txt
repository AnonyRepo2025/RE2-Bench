We are given the output:
{
    "output": [
        "alpha",
        [
            "+"
        ],
        [
            "1"
        ]
    ]
}
So split_super_sub("???") returns ("alpha", ["+"], ["1"]).

Let's break down how split_super_sub parses its input:

- It initializes pos=0, name=None, supers=[], subs=[].
- It loops through, looking for ^ (superscript) and _ (subscript), starting after each found symbol.
- The first substring up to ^ or _ is the "name".
- If the "name" ends with digits, those digits become the first element in subs.

In the output, name is "alpha", so the name parsed is "alpha", possibly with digits (as per the regex _name_with_digits_p: ^([a-zA-Z]+)([0-9]+)$).

subs: ["1"] — indicates likely that the name was something like "alpha1", or that there was a "_1" later.

supers: ["+"] — means that somewhere there was a "^+" or "__+" after the name.

Let's consider the minimal input that would be parsed as ("alpha", ["+"], ["1"]):

- If input: "alpha1^+"
  1. pos = 0
  2. finds the first ^ at position 6 (after "alpha1"), so name is "alpha1"
  3. part = "alpha1"
  4. name == "alpha1"; then loop again.
  5. At pos=6, part = "^+", so supers.append("+")
  6. Reaches end.
  7. Regex splits "alpha1" into ("alpha", "1"), so ["1"] is inserted into subs at index 0.
  8. Output becomes ("alpha", ["+"], ["1"]).

Alternatively, "alpha^+_1" would give ["alpha", ["+"], ["1"]] as well, because after parsing name="alpha", supers=["+"], and subs=["1"] (since after procesing "_1", subs.append("1")). But in that case, since name is just "alpha" (no digits), the regex doesn't split.

But since in the output, only subs is ["1"], not ["_", "1"], it's more likely the digits property is being used.

Hence, the input is likely "alpha1^+". Let's test its path:

Processing input "alpha1^+":

- pos=0
- finds "^" at pos=6
- part="alpha1" (pos: 0-6)
- name = "alpha1"
- pos moves to 6
- part="^+" (pos: 6-8), so supers.append("+")
- pos moves to 8
- exit loop (pos == len(text))
- Regex matches name="alpha1" → ("alpha", "1"), so name="alpha", subs=["1"]
- So output is ("alpha", ["+"], ["1"])

This matches.

Therefore, the input is "alpha1^+".
