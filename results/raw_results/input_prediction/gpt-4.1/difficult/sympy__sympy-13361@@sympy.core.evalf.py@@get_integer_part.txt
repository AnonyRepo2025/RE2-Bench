[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function `get_integer_part(expr, no, options, return_ints=False)` returns a tuple of two values. If `return_ints` is True, it returns two integers (the real and imaginary integer parts of the input expression).

2. The output is `[0, 0]`, so both the real and imaginary integer parts are zero.

3. The function first calls `evalf(expr, assumed_size, options)` to get the real and imaginary parts of the expression, as mpmath floats.

4. If both real and imaginary parts are present, it computes the "gap" and may re-evaluate with higher precision, but the key is that it will eventually call `calc_part` on the real and imaginary parts.

5. In `calc_part`, it computes `nint = int(to_int(nexpr, rnd))`, where `nexpr` is the mpmath float tuple for the real or imaginary part. If the part is exactly zero, this will be zero.

6. The function then returns the integer part of the real and imaginary components.

7. For the output to be `[0, 0]`, the real and imaginary parts of `expr` must both have integer part zero.

8. The simplest such expression is `0`, or any expression that evaluates to `0 + 0*I`.

9. The parameter `no` is used in `nint += int(no * (mpf_cmp(x or fzero, fzero) == no))`, but if the value is exactly zero, this will not affect the result.

10. The options are `{}` and `return_ints` must be `True` to get integer output.

Therefore, the minimal input is:
- expr: 0
- no: 1 (default, but could be -1 as well, but 1 is standard)
- options: {}
- return_ints: True
