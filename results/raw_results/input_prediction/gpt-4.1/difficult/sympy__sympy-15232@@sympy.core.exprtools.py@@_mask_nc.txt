[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function and the output step by step.

1. The function `_mask_nc(eq, name=None)` is designed to "mask" non-commutative (NC) objects in a SymPy expression with dummy symbols, returning a tuple: (masked_expr, reverse_subs_dict, list_of_nc_syms).

2. The output is:
```
[
    "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n",
    null,
    null
]
```
So, the first element is the string representation of the returned expression, and the other two are null (i.e., None in Python).

3. The function only returns (expr, None, None) if the input expression is commutative (see the line: if expr.is_commutative: return (eq, {}, [])), but in that case, the second element would be an empty dict, not None. However, later in the function, if no replacements are made, the dict comprehension {v: k for k, v in rep} or None will return None if rep is empty.

4. The output expression is "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n". This is a sum of two products of symbols. In SymPy, unless specified otherwise, all symbols are commutative by default.

5. For the function to return (expr, None, None), the input must be commutative and no replacements are made.

6. Therefore, the input must be the expression "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n", with all symbols commutative.

7. The function does not use the 'self' parameter, so it can be ignored.

8. The input structure is:
```
{
    "self": {},
    "args": {
        "eq": XXX
    },
    "kwargs": {}
}
```
So, XXX should be the SymPy expression: x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n

9. In code, this would be: sympify("x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n") or just "x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n" as a string, but the function expects a SymPy expression.

10. Therefore, the input should be the SymPy expression: x*n*m*o*n + n*m*n*o*m*n
