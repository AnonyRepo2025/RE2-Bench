Let's analyze the function _get_kernel_params and the output.

1. The output is {"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}. This means the function returns a dictionary with these two keys and values.

2. The function logic:
   - If self.kernel_params is not None, params = self.kernel_params. Otherwise, params = {}.
   - If not callable(self.kernel) and self.kernel != 'precomputed', then for param in KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel], if getattr(self, param) is not None, params[param] = getattr(self, param).
   - Otherwise, if self.gamma, self.coef0, or self.degree is not None, raise ValueError.

3. For the function to return {"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}, params must be a dict with those keys and values. This can happen in two ways:
   a) self.kernel_params is None, and self.kernel is a string (not callable, not 'precomputed'), and KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel] contains 'coef0' and 'degree', and self.coef0 and self.degree are set to 0.1 and 3.1, respectively.
   b) self.kernel_params is already {"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}.

4. If self.kernel_params is not None, the function would just return it (with possible additions if kernel is not callable and not 'precomputed'). But if kernel_params is exactly {"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}, the function would return that.

5. However, the function will add self.coef0 and self.degree to params if they are not None and if kernel is not callable and not 'precomputed'.

6. But if kernel_params is None, and self.kernel is a string (not callable, not 'precomputed'), and KERNEL_PARAMS[self.kernel] contains 'coef0' and 'degree', and self.coef0 and self.degree are set, then the function will return a dict with those values.

7. Let's check what kernels in KERNEL_PARAMS have 'coef0' and 'degree' as parameters. In scikit-learn, 'poly' and 'sigmoid' kernels have both 'coef0' and 'degree' (but 'sigmoid' does not have 'degree', only 'coef0'). 'poly' has both.

8. So, if self.kernel == 'poly', KERNEL_PARAMS['poly'] = ['gamma', 'coef0', 'degree'].

9. Therefore, the minimal input is:
   - self.kernel = 'poly'
   - self.coef0 = 0.1
   - self.degree = 3.1
   - self.gamma = None (since not in output)
   - self.kernel_params = None (so the function builds the dict)
   - n_components, random_state, normalization_, components_, component_indices_ can be anything (not used here).

10. If self.kernel_params was already {"coef0": 0.1, "degree": 3.1}, and kernel is not callable and not 'precomputed', the function would still add self.coef0 and self.degree if they are not None, but if they are None, the dict would remain as is. But the most direct way is to set kernel_params = None and set the attributes.

11. Therefore, the input should be:
   - kernel: "poly"
   - gamma: None
   - coef0: 0.1
   - degree: 3.1
   - kernel_params: None
   - n_components: (any, e.g. 100)
   - random_state: (any, e.g. None)
   - normalization_: (any, e.g. None)
   - components_: (any, e.g. None)
   - component_indices_: (any, e.g. None)
