[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function `restify` and see how it can return ":py:obj:`None`".

1. The function starts by checking if `cls is None or cls is NoneType`. If so, it returns ':py:obj:`None`'.
2. The output is exactly ':py:obj:`None`', so the function must have taken this branch.
3. Therefore, the input `cls` must be either `None` or `NoneType`.
4. The function checks `if cls is None or cls is NoneType:`. If `cls` is `None`, this is true. If `cls` is `NoneType`, this is also true.
5. Both `None` and `NoneType` as input would produce the output.

Since the output is ":py:obj:`None`", the simplest and most direct input is `None`.
