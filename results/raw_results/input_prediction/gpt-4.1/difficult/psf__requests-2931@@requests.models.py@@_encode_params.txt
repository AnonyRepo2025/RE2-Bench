[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `_encode_params` is designed to encode parameters for a request, similar to how query strings are built.
2. If `data` is a string or bytes, it is returned as-is. If it has a `.read` attribute, it is returned as-is. Otherwise, if it is iterable, it is processed.
3. The function uses `to_key_val_list(data)` to convert the input into a list of (key, value) pairs.
4. For each (k, vs) in the list, if `vs` is a string or not iterable, it is wrapped in a list. Then, for each `v` in `vs`, if `v` is not None, it is encoded (if string) and appended to the result list as a tuple.
5. Finally, `urlencode(result, doseq=True)` is called, which produces a query string with keys and values.

Given the output: "z=1&a=1&k=1&d=1"

- This is a query string with four key-value pairs: z=1, a=1, k=1, d=1.
- The order is z, a, k, d. `urlencode` preserves the order of the input list.
- The input must be an iterable of pairs, or a mapping (dict), or something that `to_key_val_list` can convert to such a list.

If we use a dict: {"z": 1, "a": 1, "k": 1, "d": 1}, the order is not guaranteed (unless it's an OrderedDict or Python 3.7+ dict, but the function is written for compatibility, so let's assume order is not guaranteed).

To guarantee the order, the input should be a list of tuples: [("z", 1), ("a", 1), ("k", 1), ("d", 1)].

Alternatively, an OrderedDict with that order would also work.

Therefore, the most straightforward input is a list of tuples: [("z", 1), ("a", 1), ("k", 1), ("d", 1)].
