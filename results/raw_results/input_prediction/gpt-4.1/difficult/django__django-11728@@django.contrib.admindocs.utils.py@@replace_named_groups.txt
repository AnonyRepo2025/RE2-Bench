[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze what the function does and how to reverse it.

1. The function `replace_named_groups` takes a regex pattern string and replaces named groups of the form `(?P<name>...)` with just `name`.
2. It uses a regex to find all named groups: `named_group_matcher = re.compile('\\(\\?P(<\\w+>)')`. But this regex is incorrect: it matches `(?P<name>` as `(?P<name>`, but the group is captured as `<name>`, not just `name`. However, let's assume the intention is to match named groups.
3. For each named group, it finds the full group pattern (from `(?P<name>` to the matching closing parenthesis), and then replaces the whole group with just the group name.

Given the output is `"admin/password_change/done/"`, and the function only removes named groups, the input must have been a regex pattern that, after removing all named groups, results in this string.

But the function only replaces named groups, so if the input is `"admin/password_change/done/"`, the output is the same. But the function is designed to remove named groups, so the input must have contained at least one named group.

Let's try to reconstruct a possible input:

Suppose the input was: `"admin/password_change/done/"` (no named groups). The output would be the same.

But the function is designed to remove named groups, so perhaps the input was something like: `"admin/(?P<foo>password_change)/done/"`

Let's test this:

- The named group is `(?P<foo>password_change)`.
- The function would find this, and replace it with `foo`.
- So the output would be `"admin/foo/done/"`, which is not the same as the output.

Alternatively, what if the input was `"admin/password_change/done/"`? Then the output is the same.

But the function is designed to remove named groups, so perhaps the input was `"(?P<admin>admin)/(?P<password_change>password_change)/(?P<done>done)/"`

- The function would replace each named group with its name, resulting in `"admin/password_change/done/"`.

Let's check the function's logic step by step:

- It finds all named groups using the regex.
- For each, it finds the full group pattern and the group name.
- It replaces the group pattern with the group name.

So, for input `"(?P<admin>admin)/(?P<password_change>password_change)/(?P<done>done)/"`, the output would be `"admin/password_change/done/"`.

Therefore, the input is likely:

"(?P<admin>admin)/(?P<password_change>password_change)/(?P<done>done)/"
