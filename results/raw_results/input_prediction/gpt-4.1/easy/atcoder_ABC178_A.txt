[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to x.
2. If x == 1, it prints 0.
3. Otherwise, it prints 1.

The output is 1. This means the else branch was executed, so x != 1.

Therefore, the input must be any integer except 1. The most likely value is 2 (the next simplest integer), but any integer except 1 would work.

To match the output exactly, let's use 2.

So, the input should be:
{
    "input": 2
}
