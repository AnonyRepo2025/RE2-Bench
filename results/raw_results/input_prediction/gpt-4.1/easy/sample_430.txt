The function f takes two lists, arr1 and arr2. It copies arr1, then extends it with arr2, and returns the result. So the output is simply arr1 + arr2 (concatenation).

Given the output:
[5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]

We need to split this list into two parts: arr1 and arr2, such that their concatenation gives the output. There are many possible ways to split, but the most natural is to assume arr1 is the prefix and arr2 is the suffix.

Since there is no other information, the most likely split is arr1 is the first k elements, arr2 is the rest, for some k.

But the structure of the output suggests arr1 and arr2 could be any split. The default is to assume arr1 is the first part, arr2 is the second part.

Let's try arr1 = [5, 1, 3], arr2 = [7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]. But that's arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps arr1 is empty and arr2 is the whole list, or vice versa.

But the most straightforward is to take arr1 as the first n elements, arr2 as the rest, for some n.

Since the function is so simple, and the structure is open, let's take arr1 as the first 3 elements, arr2 as the rest.

So:
arr1 = [5, 1, 3]
arr2 = [7, 8, "", 0, -1, []]

Alternatively, arr1 could be [5, 1, 3, 7], arr2 = [8, "", 0, -1, []], etc.

But any such split is valid. The most basic is to split after the first element.

But since the function is so simple, and the output is a concatenation, any split is valid.

But the most likely is arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], arr2 = ["", 0, -1, []].

Let's check: [5, 1, 3, 7, 8] + ["", 0, -1, []] = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8, "", 0, -1, []], which matches the output.

So, arr1 = [5, 1, 3, 7, 8], arr2 = ["", 0, -1, []].
