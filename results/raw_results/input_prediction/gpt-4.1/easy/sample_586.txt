[THOUGHT]
The function f(text, char) returns text.rindex(char), which gives the highest index in text where substring char is found. If char is not found, it raises a ValueError, but since we have an output, char must be present in text.

The output is 2, so the last occurrence of char in text is at index 2.

Let's consider possible values:
- If text = "aba", and char = "a", then text.rindex("a") == 2 (since "a" occurs at index 0 and 2).
- If text = "abc", and char = "c", then text.rindex("c") == 2 (but "c" only occurs once).
- If text = "cac", and char = "c", then text.rindex("c") == 2 (since "c" occurs at 0 and 2).

But the simplest and most canonical answer is "aba" and "a", since "a" occurs at both 0 and 2, and rindex("a") is 2.

Therefore, a valid input is:
text: "aba"
char: "a"
