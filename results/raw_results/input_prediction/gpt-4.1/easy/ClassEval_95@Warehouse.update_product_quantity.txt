[THOUGHT]
The method `update_product_quantity` updates the quantity of a product in the warehouse's inventory if the product_id exists. The output is `null`, which is expected since the function does not return anything.

The input structure shows that the inventory contains a product with id "1", with a name and a quantity. The function is called with `product_id` and `quantity`.

Since the function only updates the quantity if the product_id exists in the inventory, and the only product in the inventory is "1", the only valid product_id for the function to do anything is "1". The function will add the given `quantity` to the current quantity.

However, since the output is always `null`, we don't know the exact values of name or quantity, nor the value of `quantity` argument, unless more information is given. But the structure requires us to fill in the placeholders.

To make the function do something, let's assume:
- The product name is "Widget"
- The initial quantity is 10
- The function is called with product_id "1" and quantity 5

This will increase the quantity from 10 to 15.
