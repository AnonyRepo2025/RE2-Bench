The method `calculate_sector_area` computes the area of a sector using the formula: area = radius^2 * angle / 2. The output is 6.283185307179586, which is exactly 2 * pi. Let's denote the radius as r and the angle as a.

So, r^2 * a / 2 = 2 * pi

Let's try some likely values:
- If angle is in radians, a full circle is 2*pi, half is pi, quarter is pi/2, etc.
- Let's try r = 2, a = pi:
    2^2 * pi / 2 = 4 * pi / 2 = 2 * pi = 6.283185307179586

This matches the output. So, radius = 2, angle = pi.
