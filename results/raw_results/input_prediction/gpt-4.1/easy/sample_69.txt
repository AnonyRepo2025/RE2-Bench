[THOUGHT]
The function f takes a dictionary student_marks and a name. It checks if name is in student_marks. If so, it pops and returns the value for that name. Otherwise, it returns "Name unknown".

The output is "Name unknown", which means the if condition was False: name was not in student_marks.

From the structure, student_marks is {"882afmfp": XXX}, so the only key in the dictionary is "882afmfp".

Therefore, for the function to return "Name unknown", the name argument must be something other than "882afmfp".

The value associated with "882afmfp" does not matter, since it is not accessed.

So, for example, name could be "alice", and the value for "882afmfp" can be anything (e.g., 42).
