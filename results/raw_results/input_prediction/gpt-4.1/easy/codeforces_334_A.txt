[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code and the output step by step.

The code reads an integer n from input. Then it sets i = 1 and j = n * n. It enters a while loop: while i < j, it prints i and j, then increments i and decrements j.

The output is a sequence of lines, each of the form "i j", starting from "1 100", "2 99", ..., up to "50 51".

Let's look at the first and last lines:
- First line: 1 100
- Last line: 50 51

Let's see how many lines are printed:
- The first line is i=1, j=100
- The second line is i=2, j=99
- ...
- The last line is i=50, j=51

After that, i would be incremented to 51, j decremented to 50, so i=51, j=50, and the loop condition i < j is no longer true.

So, the number of lines printed is from i=1 to i=50 (inclusive), so 50 lines.

Now, recall that j starts at n*n. The first line is 1 100, so n*n = 100, so n = 10.

Therefore, the input is 10.
