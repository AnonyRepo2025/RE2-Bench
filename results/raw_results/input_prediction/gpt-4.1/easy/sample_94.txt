[THOUGHT]
The function f(a, b) returns a new dictionary by merging dictionaries a and b, with b's keys overwriting a's if there are duplicates. The output is {"w": 3, "wi": 10}. 

Looking at the structure, both a and b have a "w" key, and a has an additional "wi" key. Since the output "w" is 3, and "wi" is 10, and since b's "w" overwrites a's "w", b["w"] must be 3. a["wi"] must be 10, as b does not have a "wi" key. a["w"] can be any value, but it will be overwritten by b["w"] in the output.

So, for example:
a = {"w": X, "wi": 10}
b = {"w": 3}
The output will be {"w": 3, "wi": 10} for any value of X.

Let's pick a["w"] = 0 for simplicity.
