[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes two arguments: s (a string) and ch (a character).
2. It sets sl = s.
3. If ch is in s:
    - sl = s.lstrip(ch) (removes all leading ch from s)
    - If len(sl) == 0:
        - sl = sl + '!?'
    - else: nothing
4. Else: return 'no'
5. Finally, return sl

We are told the output is "ff".

Let's work backwards:
- The function returns sl, so sl must be "ff" at the end.
- The only way the function returns 'no' is if ch is not in s, but output is "ff", so ch is in s.
- sl = s.lstrip(ch). For sl to be "ff", s.lstrip(ch) == "ff".
- That means s starts with one or more ch, and after removing all leading ch, we get "ff".

So, s = ch*X + "ff", where X >= 1.

Also, if len(sl) == 0, sl would become '!?', but output is "ff", so len(sl) != 0, so s.lstrip(ch) == "ff" and "ff" is not empty.

Now, ch can be any character, but let's try some examples:

Suppose ch = 'f':
- s = "fff" -> s.lstrip('f') = "" (empty), so would return '!?'
- s = "ff" -> s.lstrip('f') = "" (empty), so would return '!?'
- s = "fef" -> s.lstrip('f') = "ef"
- s = "fff" -> s.lstrip('f') = "" (already checked)
- s = "fff" -> s.lstrip('f') = "" (already checked)
- s = "fff" -> s.lstrip('f') = "" (already checked)
- s = "ffff" -> s.lstrip('f') = "" (already checked)
