[THOUGHT]
The method get_variance returns the variance of the data array, rounded to 2 decimal places. The output is 1.25.

Recall that np.var computes the population variance (not sample variance), which is the mean of squared deviations from the mean.

Let’s try to find a small set of numbers whose variance is 1.25.

Let’s try [1, 2, 3, 4]:
Mean = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5
Deviations: -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5
Squares: 2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25
Sum: 5
Variance: 5/4 = 1.25

So, [1, 2, 3, 4] has variance 1.25.

Therefore, the input data is [1, 2, 3, 4].
