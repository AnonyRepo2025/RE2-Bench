[THOUGHT]
The function `write_excel` takes two arguments: `data` (a list of lists, representing rows to write to an Excel file) and `file_name` (the name of the file to write to). It creates a new Excel workbook, writes the data row by row, saves the file, and returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

The output is 1, which means the function executed successfully. This means:
- The `data` argument must be a valid list of lists (each sublist is a row).
- The `file_name` must be a valid string (e.g., "output.xlsx").

Since the function is generic and only returns 1 on success, any valid data and file name would work. The minimal valid input would be a single row, e.g., [["A", "B"]], and a file name like "test.xlsx".

Therefore, a possible input is:
- data: [["A", "B"], [1, 2]]
- file_name: "test.xlsx"
