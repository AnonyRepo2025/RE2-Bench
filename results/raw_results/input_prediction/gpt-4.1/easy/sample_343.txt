The function f takes two arguments: array and elem. It extends array with elem (i.e., appends each element of elem to array), and then returns array.

The output is a list:
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [1, 2],
    1,
    [1, 2, 3],
    3,
    [2, 1]
]

This means that after array.extend(elem), array becomes this list.

Recall that list.extend(x) expects x to be iterable, and appends each element of x to the list.

So, the output is the result of array.extend(elem), i.e., array + list(elem).

But, since extend mutates the original list, the returned value is the same object as array, now extended.

So, to reconstruct the input, we need to find array and elem such that array + list(elem) == output.

Let’s try to split the output into two parts: the original array, and the elements that were added.

Suppose array = [] and elem = output. Then array.extend(elem) would give output, but that's not likely, as elem is usually a sequence.

But let's try to see if the output can be split into two parts: the first N elements are the original array, and the rest are the elements of elem.

Let’s try N = 3:
array = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [1, 2],
    1
]
elem = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    3,
    [2, 1]
]
Now, array.extend(elem) would result in:
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [1, 2],
    1,
    [1, 2, 3],
    3,
    [2, 1]
]
Which matches the output.

Therefore, the input is:
array = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [1, 2],
    1
]
elem = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    3,
    [2, 1]
]
