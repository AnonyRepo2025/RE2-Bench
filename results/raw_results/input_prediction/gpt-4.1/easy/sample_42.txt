[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes a list `nums`.
2. The first operation is `nums.clear()`, which empties the list in-place.
3. Then, it tries to iterate over `nums` (which is now empty) and append `num * 2` for each `num` in `nums`.
4. Since `nums` was cleared, the for loop does not execute at all.
5. The function returns `nums`, which is still an empty list.

Given the output is `[]`, this will always be the case, regardless of the original contents of `nums`, because the first operation is `nums.clear()`.

Therefore, any input list (including an empty list) will result in an empty list as output. However, since the output is specifically `[]`, the simplest and most direct input is also an empty list.
