[THOUGHT]
The function `triangle_area(a, h)` computes the area of a triangle using the formula: area = (a * h) / 2.0.

We are told that the output is 40.0.

So, (a * h) / 2.0 = 40.0
=> a * h = 80.0

There are infinitely many (a, h) pairs that satisfy this equation. The most straightforward is to pick integer values, for example:
If a = 8, h = 10: 8 * 10 = 80, 80 / 2.0 = 40.0

Alternatively, a = 10, h = 8 would also work.

Any such pair is valid, but the simplest is a = 8, h = 10.
