[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes three arguments: `text`, `s`, and `e`.
2. It computes `sublist = text[s:e]`.
3. If `sublist` is empty, it returns -1. But the output is 1, so `sublist` is not empty.
4. It returns `sublist.index(min(sublist))`.

We want the output to be 1. That means, in the sublist, the minimum element is at index 1.

Let's try an example:
Suppose `sublist = [a, b, c]`. If `min(sublist)` is at index 1, then `sublist[1]` is the minimum.

Let's try with numbers for clarity:
If `sublist = [5, 2, 7]`, then `min(sublist)` is 2, which is at index 1.

So, we need to pick a `text`, `s`, and `e` such that `text[s:e]` is a list where the minimum is at index 1.

Let's pick `text = [5, 2, 7]`, `s = 0`, `e = 3`. Then `sublist = [5, 2, 7]`, `min(sublist) = 2`, and `sublist.index(2) = 1`.

Alternatively, we could use a string, since slicing works on strings too. For example, `text = "bac"`, `s = 0`, `e = 3` gives `sublist = "bac"`, `min(sublist) = "a"`, and `"bac".index("a") = 1`.

Either a list or a string is valid. Let's use a list for clarity.

Final answer:
text: [5, 2, 7]
s: 0
e: 3
