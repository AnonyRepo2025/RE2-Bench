Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The code reads three integers N, A, B from input.
2. It computes: 
   - ans = (N // (A + B)) * A
   - rem = N % (A + B)
   - ans += min(rem, A)
   - print(ans)

We want the output to be 0.

Let's consider what values of N, A, B could make ans = 0.

First, ans = (N // (A + B)) * A. For this to be 0, either N < (A + B) (so N // (A + B) == 0), or A == 0.

Then, rem = N % (A + B). ans += min(rem, A). For ans to remain 0, min(rem, A) must be 0.

So, two cases:
- A == 0: then ans = 0, and ans += min(rem, 0) = 0, so output is 0 for any N, B.
- N == 0: then ans = 0, rem = 0, ans += 0, output is 0.
- N < (A + B), and min(rem, A) == 0. For min(rem, A) == 0, either rem == 0 or A == 0.

Let's try the simplest: N = 0, A = any, B = any. Input: "0 A B" → output: 0.

Alternatively, A = 0, N = any, B = any. Input: "N 0 B" → output: 0.

Let's check with N = 0, A = 1, B = 1:
- ans = 0 // 2 * 1 = 0
- rem = 0 % 2 = 0
- ans += min(0, 1) = 0
- print(ans) → 0

So, input: "0 1 1" will work.

Alternatively, A = 0, N = 5, B = 2:
- ans = 5 // 2 * 0 = 0
- rem = 5 % 2 = 1
- ans += min(1, 0) = 0
- print(ans) → 0

So, input: "5 0 2" will also work.

But the simplest is "0 1 1".
