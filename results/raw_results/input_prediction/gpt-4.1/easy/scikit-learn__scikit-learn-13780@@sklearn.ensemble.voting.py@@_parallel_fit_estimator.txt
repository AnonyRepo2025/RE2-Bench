[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the output and the function to reconstruct the input.

1. The function `_parallel_fit_estimator(estimator, X, y, sample_weight=None)` fits the estimator on X, y (and possibly sample_weight), and returns the fitted estimator. The output is a dictionary of the estimator's attributes after fitting.

2. The estimator is a logistic regression model (from the presence of attributes like penalty, dual, tol, C, fit_intercept, etc.), and the output includes:
   - "classes_": "[0 1 2]" (so y must have 3 unique classes: 0, 1, 2)
   - "coef_": shape (3, 2) (so X must have 2 features, and 3 classes)
   - "intercept_": shape (3,) (again, 3 classes)
   - "n_iter_": "[7]" (number of iterations, not directly relevant for input)
   - All other parameters are default or as shown.

3. The estimator parameters in the output are:
   - penalty: "l2"
   - dual: false
   - tol: 0.0001
   - C: 1.0
   - fit_intercept: true
   - intercept_scaling: 1
   - class_weight: null
   - random_state: 123
   - solver: "warn"
   - max_iter: 100
   - multi_class: "warn"
   - verbose: 0
   - warm_start: false
   - n_jobs: null
   - l1_ratio: null

4. The estimator must be constructed with these parameters.

5. X and y:
   - X must be a 2D array with shape (n_samples, 2) (since coef_ is (3,2)), and y must be a 1D array with 3 unique values (0, 1, 2).
   - The minimum number of samples for multiclass logistic regression is 3 (one per class), but usually more are used. However, since the output does not specify the number of samples, we can use the minimum: 3 samples, one for each class.
   - Let's use:
     X = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]]
     y = [0, 1, 2]
   - This will result in 3 samples, 2 features, and 3 classes.

6. sample_weight is not mentioned in the output, so it is likely None.

7. The "self" key is empty, as the function is not a method of a class.

Summary:
- estimator: logistic regression with the given parameters
- X: 3x2 array, e.g., [[1,0],[0,1],[1,1]]
- y: [0,1,2]
- sample_weight: None
