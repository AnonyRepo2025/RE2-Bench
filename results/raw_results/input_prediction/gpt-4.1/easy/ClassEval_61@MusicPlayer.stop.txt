[THOUGHT]
The `stop` method returns `True` only if `self.current_song` is truthy (i.e., not `None` or a falsy value). If `self.current_song` is `None`, it returns `False`. Since the output is `true`, it means that `self.current_song` was set to something truthy before calling `stop`. The other attributes (`playlist` and `volume`) do not affect the output of `stop`, so they can be any value. However, `volume` is initialized to 50 in the constructor, so unless changed, it is likely 50. `playlist` is initialized as an empty list, but could be any list. The key is that `current_song` must not be `None`.
