[THOUGHT]
The function `truncate_number` returns `number % 1.0`. The modulo operation with 1.0 returns the fractional part of the number. For example, `1.5 % 1.0` is `0.5`, `2.5 % 1.0` is `0.5`, `0.5 % 1.0` is `0.5`, and so on. 

Given that the output is `0.5`, the input `number` could be any number whose fractional part is `0.5`. The simplest such number is `0.5`, but it could also be `1.5`, `2.5`, `-0.5` (since `-0.5 % 1.0` is `0.5` in Python), etc.

However, since the function only takes one argument and the output is `0.5`, the most straightforward input is `0.5`.
