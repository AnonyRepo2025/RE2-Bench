[THOUGHT]
The method remove_employee checks if the given employee_id is in self.employees. If it is, it deletes the entry and returns True. If not, it returns False.

The output is false, so the employee_id passed to remove_employee is not in self.employees.

From the structure, self.employees contains only one employee with the key "1". Therefore, to get False, employee_id must be something other than "1" (e.g., "2", "3", etc.).

The other fields (name, position, department, salary) can be any value, as they are not used in the logic.

So, employee_id should be a value not present in self.employees, e.g., "2".
