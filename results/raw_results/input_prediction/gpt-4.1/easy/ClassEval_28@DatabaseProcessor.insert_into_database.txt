[THOUGHT]
The function `insert_into_database` inserts data into a table in a SQLite database. The output is `null`, which is expected since the function does not return anything (no return statement).

To predict the input, let's look at the function signature:
- `self` has `database_name`
- `args` has `table_name` and `data`
- `kwargs` is empty

The function expects:
- `table_name`: a string (the name of the table)
- `data`: a list of dictionaries, each with keys `'name'` and `'age'`

Since the output is always `null` regardless of the input (unless there is an error), any valid input will produce this output. However, to fill the structure, we need to provide plausible values.

A typical example would be:
- `database_name`: "test.db"
- `table_name`: "users"
- `data`: [{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}]

These are standard test values for such a function.
