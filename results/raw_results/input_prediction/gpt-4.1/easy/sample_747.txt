[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

1. The function first checks if `text == '42.42'`. If so, it returns True. Since the output is False, the input is not '42.42'.

2. Next, it enters a for loop: `for i in range(3, len(text) - 3):`
   - This means the loop will only run if `len(text) - 3 > 3`, i.e., `len(text) > 6`.
   - For each `i` in that range, it checks:
     - `text[i] == '.'`
     - `text[i - 3:].isdigit()`
     - `text[:i].isdigit()`
     - If all are True, return True.

3. If the loop never returns True, the function returns False.

So, for the function to return False:
- Either the input is '42.42' (but that's not possible, as it would return True).
- Or, for all `i` in the range, the condition is never satisfied.
- Or, the loop never runs (i.e., `len(text) <= 6`).

Therefore, the simplest way to guarantee output is False is to provide a string of length 6 or less, or a string that does not satisfy the conditions in the loop.

Examples:
- 'hello' (length 5, loop never runs)
- '123456' (length 6, loop never runs)
- 'abcdefg' (length 7, but no '.' character, so condition never satisfied)
- '123.456' (length 7, but let's check the loop: range(3, 4), i=3 only. text[3] == '.', text[0:3] == '123' (isdigit), text[0:] == '123.456' (not isdigit), so condition fails.)

So, any string of length <= 6, or a string of length > 6 that does not have a '.' at a position where the other conditions are satisfied, will return False.

Let's pick a simple example: 'hello'
