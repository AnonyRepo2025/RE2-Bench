[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. `new_list = list[:]` creates a shallow copy of the input list.
2. `new_list.sort()` sorts the copy in place (ascending order).
3. `operation(new_list)` applies the given operation to the sorted copy.
4. The function returns the original `list` (not the sorted copy).

Given the output is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`, this means the original input list was `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]` and was not modified by the function (since the function returns the original list, not the sorted or operated-on version).

The only way the output is `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]` is if the input `list` was exactly `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`.

The `operation` argument can be any callable, but since the function does not use its return value and only applies it to the sorted copy, it doesn't affect the output. The function always returns the original list, regardless of what `operation` does.

So, for the output to be as shown, the input must be:
- `list`: `[6, 4, 2, 8, 15]`
- `operation`: any callable (e.g., `lambda x: None`)
