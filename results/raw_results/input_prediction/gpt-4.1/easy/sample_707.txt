[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

1. The function takes `text` and `position`.
2. It calculates `length = len(text)`.
3. It calculates `index = position % (length + 1)`.
4. If `position < 0 or index < 0`, then `index = -1`.
5. It converts `text` to a list, pops the character at `index`, and returns the joined string.

We are told the output is "udbs l".

Let's try to reconstruct the input.

First, the output is "udbs l", which is 6 characters. That means the original text was 7 characters.

Let the original text be T, with 7 characters.

When we remove one character at index `index`, we get "udbs l".

Let's try to find a 7-letter string where removing one character gives "udbs l".

Let me try to insert a character at each position in "udbs l" to see what the original could be:

- Insert at position 0: "u" + "udbs l" = "uudbs l"
- Insert at position 1: "u" + "d" + "udbs l"[1:] = "udubs l"
- Insert at position 2: "udb" + "udbs l"[2:] = "uddbs l"
- Insert at position 3: "udbs" + "udbs l"[3:] = "udbss l"
- Insert at position 4: "udbs " + "udbs l"[4:] = "udbs  l"
- Insert at position 5: "udbs l" + "udbs l"[5:] = "udbs ll"
- Insert at position 6: "udbs l" + "udbs l"[6:] = "udbs l "

But the function uses pop(index), so the index can be from 0 to 6 (since length is 7, index can be 0 to 7, but pop(7) would be out of range).

But the function calculates index as `position % (length + 1)`, so index can be 0 to 7.

But if index == 7, pop(7) would raise IndexError, unless the code is never called with index == 7.

But let's try to reconstruct the original string.

Alternatively, let's try to reverse the process: For each possible index, insert a character and see if the result is a real word.

But "udbs l" is not a real word, so maybe the original text is "udbs l" with one more character.

Alternatively, maybe the original text is "dubs l", and after removing the first character, we get "ubs l", but that's not matching.

Alternatively, let's try to see if the original text is "udbs lX", and removing the last character gives "udbs l".

So, original text: "udbs lX", pop(6) removes "X", result: "udbs l".

So, possible original text: "udbs lX", position = 6, length = 7, index = 6 % 8 = 6.

pop(6) removes the last character.

Alternatively, let's try "udbs xl", pop(4) removes the space, result: "udbsxl".

But output is "udbs l", so the space is at position 4.

Let's try to reconstruct the original text by inserting a character at each position:

- Insert at 0: "u" + "udbs l" = "uudbs l"
- Insert at 1: "u" + "d" + "udbs l"[1:] = "udubs l"
- Insert at 2: "ud" + "b" + "udbs l"[2:] = "udbbs l"
- Insert at 3: "udb" + "s" + "udbs l"[3:] = "udbss l"
- Insert at 4: "udbs" + " " + "udbs l"[4:] = "udbs  l"
- Insert at 5: "udbs " + "l" + "udbs l"[5:] = "udbs ll"
- Insert at 6: "udbs l" + "X" = "udbs lX"

Now, let's check which of these, when pop(index) is called, gives "udbs l".

- "uudbs l", pop(0): "udbs l" ✔️
- "udubs l", pop(1): "udbs l" ✔️
- "udbbs l", pop(2): "udbs l" ✔️
- "udbss l", pop(3): "udbs l" ✔️
- "udbs  l", pop(4): "udbs l" (removes the extra space) ✔️
- "udbs ll", pop(5): "udbs l" ✔️
- "udbs lX", pop(6): "udbs l" ✔️

So, all of these, when pop(index) is called at the respective index, give "udbs l".

But the function calculates index as `position % (length + 1)`, where length = 7.

So, index = position % 8.

So, for each of these, the index is 0 to 6.

So, possible (text, position) pairs:

- ("uudbs l", 0)
- ("udubs l", 1)
- ("udbbs l", 2)
- ("udbss l", 3)
- ("udbs  l", 4)
- ("udbs ll", 5)
- ("udbs lX", 6)

Any of these would work.

Let's pick the first one: ("uudbs l", 0)
