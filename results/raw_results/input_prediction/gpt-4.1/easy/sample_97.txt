[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes a list `lst` as input.
2. The first operation is `lst.clear()`, which empties the list in-place.
3. Then, it iterates over `lst` with `for i in lst:`. However, since `lst` has just been cleared, this loop will not execute at all.
4. The `else` block of the for-loop will execute if the loop is not terminated by a `return` (i.e., if the loop completes normally, or if it never starts).
5. In this case, since the list is empty, the loop never starts, so the `else` block is executed, returning `True`.

Therefore, for the function to return `True`, the input list can be anything, because it will be cleared before the loop. The only way the function could return `False` is if the list was not cleared and contained a `3`. But since the list is always cleared before the loop, the function will always return `True` for any input.

So, any list as input will result in `True`. The minimal input is an empty list.
