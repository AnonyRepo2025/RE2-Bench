[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

The function f takes a list nums. It iterates over the indices of nums (using range(len(nums))). For each index i, if nums[i] is divisible by 3, it appends nums[i] to the end of nums. The loop is over the original length, so appending does not affect the indices being iterated.

Given the output is [1, 3, 3], let's see how this could happen.

Let the input be nums = [a, b]. Let's simulate:

- i = 0: nums[0] = a
    - If a % 3 == 0, append a to nums.
- i = 1: nums[1] = b
    - If b % 3 == 0, append b to nums.

After the loop, return nums.

Now, the output is [1, 3, 3]. So the input must have been [1, 3].

Let's check:

Input: [1, 3]
- i = 0: nums[0] = 1, 1 % 3 != 0, do nothing.
- i = 1: nums[1] = 3, 3 % 3 == 0, so append 3. Now nums = [1, 3, 3].
- Loop ends (since range(2)).

Return [1, 3, 3].

This matches the output.

Therefore, the input is [1, 3].
