[THOUGHT]
The method `generate_email_pattern` is an instance method that does not take any arguments (other than `self`). The output is a fixed string (the email regex pattern), and there are no parameters that affect the output. Therefore, the input consists of an instance of `RegexUtils` (with no state) and no arguments or keyword arguments.
