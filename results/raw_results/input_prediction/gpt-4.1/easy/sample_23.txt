[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes two arguments: `text` and `chars`.
2. If `chars` is truthy (not empty or None), it does `text = text.rstrip(chars)`. This removes all trailing characters in `chars` from the end of `text`.
3. If `chars` is falsy (empty string or None), it does `text = text.rstrip(' ')`, i.e., removes trailing spaces.
4. If the resulting `text` is empty, it returns `'-'`.
5. Otherwise, it returns the resulting `text`.

Given the output is:
```
"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."
```
This means that after the rstrip operation, the string is exactly `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`.

Let's consider what the possible inputs could be.

Case 1: `chars` is empty or None.
- Then, only spaces are stripped from the end.
- But the output does not have any trailing spaces, so the input could have had trailing spaces, or not.

Case 2: `chars` is not empty.
- Then, all trailing characters in `chars` are stripped from the end.

But in both cases, the output is the same as the input, unless there were trailing characters that were stripped.

But since the output is not `'-'`, the input after stripping is not empty.

Let's try to see if the input could have had trailing spaces or other characters.

Suppose `chars` is empty:
- Then, only spaces are stripped.
- So, input could be `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."` or `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2.   "` (with spaces at the end).

Suppose `chars` is not empty:
- Let's say `chars = '.'`, then all trailing dots would be stripped. But the output ends with a dot, so that can't be.
- If `chars` is something else, e.g., 'X', '2', etc., but the output ends with those characters, so they can't be stripped.

Therefore, the only way for the output to be exactly `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."` is if either:
- The input was exactly `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."` and `chars` is any value (since rstrip would do nothing), or
- The input was `"new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."` plus some trailing spaces, and `chars` is empty or None.

But if `chars` is not empty, and contains any character in the output's end, the output would be different.

Therefore, the most likely input is:
- `text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`
- `chars = ""` (empty string), or `None`

Alternatively, `text` could have trailing spaces, and `chars` is empty.

But the structure expects us to fill in the values, so let's use the simplest case:

- `text = "new-medium-performing-application - XQuery 2."`
- `chars = ""`
