[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a string `text` and replaces every character that is not a digit with `*`, while keeping digits unchanged. The output is the joined result of this transformation.

Given the output "5*83*23***", let's reconstruct the input step by step:

- The output has 10 characters, so the input must also have 10 characters.
- Let's map each character in the output to the rule:
    - If the output character is a digit, the input character was the same digit.
    - If the output character is '*', the input character was a non-digit (could be any non-digit character).

Let's go through each character:
1. '5' → input was '5'
2. '*' → input was a non-digit, let's use 'a'
3. '8' → input was '8'
4. '3' → input was '3'
5. '*' → input was a non-digit, let's use 'b'
6. '2' → input was '2'
7. '3' → input was '3'
8. '*' → input was a non-digit, let's use 'c'
9. '*' → input was a non-digit, let's use 'd'
10. '*' → input was a non-digit, let's use 'e'

So, a possible input is: "5a83b23cde"
