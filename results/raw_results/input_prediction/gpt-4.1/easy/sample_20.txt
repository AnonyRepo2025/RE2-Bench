[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a string `text` and reverses it by iterating from the last character to the first and concatenating each character to `result`. The output is the reversed string.

Given the output is `",saw"`, this means the input string must be the reverse of this output, i.e., "was,".

So, the input `text` should be "was,".
