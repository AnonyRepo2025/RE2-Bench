[THOUGHT]
The function `f` takes a string `text` and counts two things:
- `ws`: the number of whitespace characters in `text` (using `s.isspace()` for each character)
- `len(text)`: the total number of characters in `text`

The output is a tuple/list: (number of whitespace characters, total length of the string).

Given the output `[2, 34]`, this means:
- The string has 2 whitespace characters.
- The string has 34 characters in total.

We need to construct a string of length 34, containing exactly 2 whitespace characters (the rest can be any non-whitespace characters).

A simple example: put two spaces somewhere in a 34-character string.

For instance: "a"*16 + " " + "b"*16 + " "  (that's 16 + 1 + 16 + 1 = 34)

Let's check:
- "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb " (16 a's, space, 16 b's, space)
- Number of whitespace: 2 (the two spaces)
- Length: 34

Alternatively, the whitespace could be any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.), but the simplest is spaces.

So, a valid input is: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb "
