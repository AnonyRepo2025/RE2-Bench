[THOUGHT]
The __len__ method of CamelCaseMap returns the length of the internal dictionary self._data. The output is 1, which means self._data contains exactly one key-value pair. The structure shows the key is "firstName" and the value is a placeholder XXX. The value can be anything, as only the number of items matters for __len__. Therefore, to produce output 1, self._data must be {"firstName": <any value>}.
