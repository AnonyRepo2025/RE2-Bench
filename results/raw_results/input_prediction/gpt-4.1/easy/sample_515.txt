[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. `result = array.copy()`  
   - Makes a shallow copy of the input list.

2. `result.reverse()`  
   - Reverses the list in place.

3. `result[:] = [item * 2 for item in result]`  
   - Replaces the contents of the list with each item multiplied by 2.

4. `return result`  
   - Returns the modified list.

Given the output: `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`

Let's reverse engineer:

- The final list is `[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`.
- This is after multiplying each element by 2.
- So, before the multiplication, the reversed list was `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- Therefore, the original list before reversing was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

So, the input array should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
