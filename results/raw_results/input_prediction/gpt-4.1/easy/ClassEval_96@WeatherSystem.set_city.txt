[THOUGHT]
The method `set_city` sets the `city` attribute of the `WeatherSystem` instance to the provided argument. The method does not return anything, so the output is always `null` (i.e., `None` in Python).

Given only the output `null`, there is no information about what the input city was, nor what the previous city was. The only requirement is that the method is called, and the output is always `null`.

Therefore, any value for `city` is valid, and the rest of the attributes (`temperature`, `weather`, `city`, `weather_list`) can be any value before the call. The only thing we can do is to fill in placeholders with example values.

But since the structure requires us to fill in the values, let's assume a plausible scenario:
- Before calling `set_city`, the object has some city, say "London".
- We call `set_city` with "Paris".

So:
- self.city: "London"
- args.city: "Paris"
- self.temperature: None
- self.weather: None
- self.weather_list: {}
