[THOUGHT]
The `__delitem__` method deletes an item from the internal dictionary `_data` using a key that is first converted to camel case if it is a string. The output is `null`, which is expected for a method that does not return anything (i.e., it just performs an action).

The structure for input shows that `_data` is empty (`{}`), so regardless of the key provided, the method will attempt to delete a key from an empty dictionary, which would normally raise a `KeyError`. However, since the output is `null` (i.e., no return value), and the code snippet does not show exception handling, we can infer that the function was called, but the actual key value is not specified by the output.

Since the only requirement is to predict the input that would produce this output (i.e., a call to `__delitem__` with any key, on an empty dictionary), any key is valid. The most generic and likely test case is a string key, e.g., "some_key".

Thus, the input should be:
- self: {"_data": {}} (empty dict)
- args: {"key": "some_key"}
- kwargs: {}
