[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step.

Given output: [58, 92, 21]

The function:
1. Reverses `array`.
2. For each `value` in `values`, inserts it at the middle of the current `array` (using integer division for the index).
3. Reverses `array` again.
4. Returns `array`.

Let the original input be `array = A`, `values = V`.

Let’s denote the original array as A = [a1, a2, a3, ...], and values as V = [v1, v2, ...].

Let’s try to reverse engineer.

Let’s call the final output O = [58, 92, 21].

Let’s simulate the function backwards.

After the final reverse, the array is O = [58, 92, 21].

So, before the final reverse, the array was [21, 92, 58].

Let’s call this state S1 = [21, 92, 58].

Now, let's think about how the insertions happened.

The function starts by reversing the original array, so let's call the reversed original array R.

Then, for each value in `values`, it inserts at the middle (len(array)//2).

Let’s try to reconstruct the process.

Let’s suppose the original array had n elements, and values had m elements.

Let’s try with small possibilities.

Suppose values has 1 element.

But the function inserts each value in values, so the number of insertions is len(values).

Let’s try to reconstruct with the output.

Let’s try to simulate the function with some possible inputs.

Let’s try with array = [21], values = [92, 58].

Step 1: array.reverse() → [21]
Step 2: for value in [92, 58]:
    - Insert 92 at len(array)//2 = 1//2 = 0 → array becomes [92, 21]
    - Insert 58 at len(array)//2 = 2//2 = 1 → array becomes [92, 58, 21]
Step 3: array.reverse() → [21, 58, 92]

But this is not the output. The output is [58, 92, 21].

Let’s try array = [21], values = [58, 92].

Step 1: array.reverse() → [21]
Step 2: for value in [58, 92]:
    - Insert 58 at 0 → [58, 21]
    - Insert 92 at 1 → [58, 92, 21]
Step 3: array.reverse() → [21, 92, 58]

Still not matching.

Let’s try array = [58], values = [92, 21].

Step 1: [58]
Insert 92 at 0 → [92, 58]
Insert 21 at 1 → [92, 21, 58]
Reverse: [58, 21, 92]

No.

Let’s try array = [21], values = [92, 58] but reverse the order.

Alternatively, maybe the original array had more than one element.

Let’s try array = [21, 92], values = [58].

Step 1: [21, 92] → reverse → [92, 21]
Insert 58 at len(array)//2 = 2//2 = 1 → [92, 58, 21]
Reverse: [21, 58, 92]

No.

Try array = [92, 21], values = [58].

Reverse: [21, 92]
Insert 58 at 1 → [21, 58, 92]
Reverse: [92, 58, 21]

No.

Try array = [58, 92], values = [21].

Reverse: [92, 58]
Insert 21 at 1 → [92, 21, 58]
Reverse: [58, 21, 92]

No.

Try array = [58, 21], values = [92].

Reverse: [21, 58]
Insert 92 at 1 → [21, 92, 58]
Reverse: [58, 92, 21]

This matches the output!

So, array = [58, 21], values = [92].

Let’s check step by step:

Input: array = [58, 21], values = [92]
Step 1: array.reverse() → [21, 58]
Step 2: for value in [92]:
    - Insert 92 at len(array)//2 = 2//2 = 1 → [21, 92, 58]
Step 3: array.reverse() → [58, 92, 21]

This matches the output.

Therefore, the input is:
array: [58, 21]
values: [92]
