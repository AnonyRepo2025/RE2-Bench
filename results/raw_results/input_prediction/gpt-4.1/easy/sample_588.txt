The function f takes a list `items` and a value `target`. It returns the index of `target` in `items` if it exists, otherwise -1.

The output is 3, which means that `target` is present in `items` at index 3.

So, `items` must be a list where the value at index 3 is equal to `target`. For example, if `items = [a, b, c, d, ...]`, then `items[3] == target`.

The simplest example is to use a list of numbers: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], and set target = 3. Then, items.index(3) == 3.

Alternatively, any list where the fourth element (index 3) is equal to `target` will work.

Let's use: items = ["a", "b", "c", "d"], target = "d". "d" is at index 3.

Alternatively, items = [1, 2, 5, 7], target = 7.

Any of these are valid, but let's use the simplest: items = [0, 1, 2, 3], target = 3.
