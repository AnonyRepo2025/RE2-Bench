[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The input is split into two parts: `a` and `b`.
2. `b` is modified: `b = b[0] + b[2:]` (i.e., take the first character and then the substring from the third character onward, skipping the second character).
3. Both `a` and `b` are converted to integers.
4. The output is `a * b // 100`.

The output is 0, so `a * b // 100 == 0`. This means that either `a` or `b` is 0, or their product is less than 100.

Let's try some small values.

Suppose `a = 1`, `b = 01` (as a string). But after the transformation, `b = b[0] + b[2:]`. If `b` is "01", then `b[0] = '0'`, `b[2:]` is empty, so `b = '0'`. So `b = 0` as integer.

So, input: "1 01" → a = 1, b = 0 → 1 * 0 // 100 = 0.

Alternatively, try "100 01": a = 100, b = 0 → 0.

Alternatively, try "1 10": b[0] = '1', b[2:] = '', so b = '1' → b = 1, a = 1 → 1 * 1 // 100 = 0.

Alternatively, try "1 12": b[0] = '1', b[2:] = '2', so b = '12' → b = 12, a = 1 → 1 * 12 // 100 = 0.

Alternatively, try "10 12": a = 10, b = 12 → 10 * 12 = 120 // 100 = 1 (not 0).

So, as long as a * b < 100, the output will be 0.

But the transformation on b is: take the first character, skip the second, then take the rest.

So, for "1 01", b becomes "0", a = 1, so output is 0.

So, a valid input is "1 01".
