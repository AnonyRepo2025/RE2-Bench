The method `median` computes the median of a list of numbers. If the list length is odd, it returns the middle value after sorting. If even, it returns the average of the two middle values, rounded to 2 decimals.

The output is 5, which means:
- If the list length is odd, the middle value after sorting is 5.
- If the list length is even, the average of the two middle values is 5 (so both must be 5, or their average is 5).

Let's consider the odd-length case first:
- For example, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] → sorted: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], n=5, middle=2, sorted_data[2]=5.

For the even-length case:
- For example, [4, 5, 5, 6] → sorted: [4, 5, 5, 6], n=4, middle=2, (sorted_data[1]+sorted_data[2])/2 = (5+5)/2 = 5.

But the most straightforward and minimal input is an odd-length list with 5 as the middle value, e.g., [5].

But [5] would return 5, but let's check if that's possible. n=1, n%2==1, middle=0, sorted_data[0]=5 → output 5.

So both [5] and any odd-length list with 5 as the middle value would work.

But the most canonical is [5].

Alternatively, [1, 5, 9] → sorted: [1, 5, 9], n=3, middle=1, sorted_data[1]=5.

Any of these are valid, but the minimal is [5].
