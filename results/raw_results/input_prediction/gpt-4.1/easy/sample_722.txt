The function `f` takes a string `text` and inverts the case of each character: if a character is uppercase, it becomes lowercase, and vice versa. The output is ",WpZpPPDL/".

To find the input, we need to invert the case of each character in the output:

- ',' is not a letter, so it remains ','
- 'W' is uppercase, so input must have been 'w'
- 'p' is lowercase, so input must have been 'P'
- 'Z' is uppercase, so input must have been 'z'
- 'p' is lowercase, so input must have been 'P'
- 'P' is uppercase, so input must have been 'p'
- 'P' is uppercase, so input must have been 'p'
- 'D' is uppercase, so input must have been 'd'
- 'L' is uppercase, so input must have been 'l'
- '/' is not a letter, so it remains '/'

So, the input string is: ",wPzPppdl/"
