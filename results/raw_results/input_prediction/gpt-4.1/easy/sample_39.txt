The function f takes an array and an element. It checks if elem is in array. If so, it returns the index of elem in array; otherwise, it returns -1.

The output is 0. This means that elem is in array, and its index is 0. That is, elem is the first element of array.

So, array[0] == elem.

The simplest example is array = [x], elem = x, for any x.

But any array where the first element equals elem will work, e.g., array = [1, 2, 3], elem = 1.

So, possible input:
array = [1, 2, 3], elem = 1

Or, array = ["a", "b"], elem = "a"

Any such pair is valid. Let's use numbers for clarity.
