The function computes the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The formula is:
1. Compute the mean of the numbers.
2. For each number, compute the absolute difference from the mean.
3. Take the mean of those absolute differences.

Let’s denote the list as [a, b, c]. Let’s try with 3 numbers, as the output is a repeating decimal (2/3), which is common for 3 numbers.

Let’s try [0, 1, 2]:
- mean = (0+1+2)/3 = 1
- abs(0-1) = 1
- abs(1-1) = 0
- abs(2-1) = 1
- sum = 1+0+1 = 2
- MAD = 2/3 ≈ 0.6666666666666666

This matches the output.

Therefore, the input numbers must be [0, 1, 2].
