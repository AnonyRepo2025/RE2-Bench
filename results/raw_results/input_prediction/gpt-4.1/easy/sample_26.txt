[THOUGHT]
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes `items` (a string) and `target` (an iterable, likely a string or list).
2. It splits `items` by whitespace, iterates over each `i` in the split list.
3. For each `i`:
   - If `i in target`, it returns `items.index(i) + 1`.
   - If `i.index('.') == len(i) - 1 or i.index('.') == 0`, it returns 'error'.
4. If none of the above, returns '.'.

We are told the output is "error".

This means that for some `i` in `items.split()`, the following must be true:
- `i` is NOT in `target` (otherwise, it would return an integer).
- `i` contains a '.' character (otherwise, `i.index('.')` would raise ValueError).
- The '.' is either at the start or end of `i` (i.e., `i[0] == '.'` or `i[-1] == '.'`).

So, for example, if `items = "foo .bar baz"`, then `i` will be "foo", ".bar", "baz" in order.
- "foo": not in target, does not contain '.', so nothing happens.
- ".bar": not in target, contains '.', and at index 0, so returns 'error'.

Alternatively, if `items = "foo bar. baz"`, then "bar." would trigger the error ('.' at the end).

Also, if the first item is ".foo", it would immediately return 'error'.

So, the minimal input is any string where at least one word has a '.' at the start or end, and that word is not in `target`.

Let's pick a simple example:
- `items = ".foo bar"`
- `target = ""` (empty string, so nothing is in target)

First iteration: i = ".foo"
- ".foo" not in target
- ".foo".index('.') == 0 (since '.' is at the start)
- So, returns 'error'

Thus, this input will produce the required output.

Alternatively, `items = "foo bar."`, `target = ""` would also work.

But let's use the first, as it's minimal and clear.
