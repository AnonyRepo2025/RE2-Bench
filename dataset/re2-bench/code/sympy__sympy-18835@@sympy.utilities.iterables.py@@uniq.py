def uniq(seq, result=None):
    """
    Yield unique elements from ``seq`` as an iterator. The second
    parameter ``result``  is used internally; it is not necessary
    to pass anything for this.

    Note: changing the sequence during iteration will raise a
    RuntimeError if the size of the sequence is known; if you pass
    an iterator and advance the iterator you will change the
    output of this routine but there will be no warning.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import uniq
    >>> dat = [1, 4, 1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 2]
    >>> type(uniq(dat)) in (list, tuple)
    False

    >>> list(uniq(dat))
    [1, 4, 5, 2]
    >>> list(uniq(x for x in dat))
    [1, 4, 5, 2]
    >>> list(uniq([[1], [2, 1], [1]]))
