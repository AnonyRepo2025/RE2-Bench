class RFECV(RFE):
    """Feature ranking with recursive feature elimination and cross-validated
    selection of the best number of features.

    See glossary entry for :term:`cross-validation estimator`.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <rfe>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : object
        A supervised learning estimator with a ``fit`` method that provides
        information about feature importance either through a ``coef_``
        attribute or through a ``feature_importances_`` attribute.

    step : int or float, optional (default=1)
        If greater than or equal to 1, then ``step`` corresponds to the
        (integer) number of features to remove at each iteration.
        If within (0.0, 1.0), then ``step`` corresponds to the percentage
        (rounded down) of features to remove at each iteration.
        Note that the last iteration may remove fewer than ``step`` features in
        order to reach ``min_features_to_select``.

    min_features_to_select : int, (default=1)
        The minimum number of features to be selected. This number of features
        will always be scored, even if the difference between the original
        feature count and ``min_features_to_select`` isn't divisible by
        ``step``.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - None, to use the default 5-fold cross-validation,
        - integer, to specify the number of folds.
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if ``y`` is binary or multiclass,
        :class:`sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold` is used. If the
        estimator is a classifier or if ``y`` is neither binary nor multiclass,
        :class:`sklearn.model_selection.KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
            ``cv`` default value of None changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.

    scoring : string, callable or None, optional, (default=None)
        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or
        a scorer callable object / function with signature
        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``.

    verbose : int, (default=0)
        Controls verbosity of output.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Number of cores to run in parallel while fitting across folds.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_ : int
        The number of selected features with cross-validation.

    support_ : array of shape [n_features]
        The mask of selected features.

    ranking_ : array of shape [n_features]
        The feature ranking, such that `ranking_[i]`
        corresponds to the ranking
        position of the i-th feature.
        Selected (i.e., estimated best)
        features are assigned rank 1.

    grid_scores_ : array of shape [n_subsets_of_features]
        The cross-validation scores such that
        ``grid_scores_[i]`` corresponds to
        the CV score of the i-th subset of features.

    estimator_ : object
        The external estimator fit on the reduced dataset.

    Notes
    -----
    The size of ``grid_scores_`` is equal to
    ``ceil((n_features - min_features_to_select) / step) + 1``,
    where step is the number of features removed at each iteration.

    Allows NaN/Inf in the input if the underlying estimator does as well.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example shows how to retrieve the a-priori not known 5
    informative features in the Friedman #1 dataset.

    >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_friedman1
    >>> from sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV
    >>> from sklearn.svm import SVR
    >>> X, y = make_friedman1(n_samples=50, n_features=10, random_state=0)
    >>> estimator = SVR(kernel="linear")
    >>> selector = RFECV(estimator, step=1, cv=5)
    >>> selector = selector.fit(X, y)
    >>> selector.support_
    array([ True,  True,  True,  True,  True, False, False, False, False,
           False])
    >>> selector.ranking_
    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 4, 3, 2, 5])
