        scheme in which every m-th item is selected until all have been chosen.
        The returned permutation has elements listed by the order in which they
        were selected.

        The parameter ``s`` stops the selection process when there are ``s``
        items remaining and these are selected by continuing the selection,
        counting by 1 rather than by ``m``.

        Consider selecting every 3rd item from 6 until only 2 remain::
