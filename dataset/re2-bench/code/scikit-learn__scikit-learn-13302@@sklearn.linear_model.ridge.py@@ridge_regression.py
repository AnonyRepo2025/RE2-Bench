    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix, LinearOperator},
        shape = [n_samples, n_features]
        Training data

    y : array-like, shape = [n_samples] or [n_samples, n_targets]
        Target values

    alpha : {float, array-like},
        shape = [n_targets] if array-like
        Regularization strength; must be a positive float. Regularization
        improves the conditioning of the problem and reduces the variance of
        the estimates. Larger values specify stronger regularization.
        Alpha corresponds to ``C^-1`` in other linear models such as
        LogisticRegression or LinearSVC. If an array is passed, penalties are
        assumed to be specific to the targets. Hence they must correspond in
        number.

    sample_weight : float or numpy array of shape [n_samples]
        Individual weights for each sample. If sample_weight is not None and
        solver='auto', the solver will be set to 'cholesky'.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17

    solver : {'auto', 'svd', 'cholesky', 'lsqr', 'sparse_cg', 'sag', 'saga'}
        Solver to use in the computational routines:

        - 'auto' chooses the solver automatically based on the type of data.

        - 'svd' uses a Singular Value Decomposition of X to compute the Ridge
          coefficients. More stable for singular matrices than
          'cholesky'.

        - 'cholesky' uses the standard scipy.linalg.solve function to
          obtain a closed-form solution via a Cholesky decomposition of
          dot(X.T, X)

        - 'sparse_cg' uses the conjugate gradient solver as found in
          scipy.sparse.linalg.cg. As an iterative algorithm, this solver is
          more appropriate than 'cholesky' for large-scale data
          (possibility to set `tol` and `max_iter`).

        - 'lsqr' uses the dedicated regularized least-squares routine
          scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr. It is the fastest and uses an iterative
          procedure.

        - 'sag' uses a Stochastic Average Gradient descent, and 'saga' uses
          its improved, unbiased version named SAGA. Both methods also use an
          iterative procedure, and are often faster than other solvers when
          both n_samples and n_features are large. Note that 'sag' and
          'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with
          approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with a
          scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.


        All last five solvers support both dense and sparse data. However, only
        'sag' and 'sparse_cg' supports sparse input when`fit_intercept` is
        True.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.
        .. versionadded:: 0.19
           SAGA solver.

    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations for conjugate gradient solver.
        For the 'sparse_cg' and 'lsqr' solvers, the default value is determined
        by scipy.sparse.linalg. For 'sag' and saga solver, the default value is
        1000.

    tol : float
        Precision of the solution.

    verbose : int
        Verbosity level. Setting verbose > 0 will display additional
        information depending on the solver used.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default None
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator to use when shuffling
        the data.  If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number
        generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number
        generator; If None, the random number generator is the RandomState
        instance used by `np.random`. Used when ``solver`` == 'sag'.

    return_n_iter : boolean, default False
        If True, the method also returns `n_iter`, the actual number of
        iteration performed by the solver.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17

    return_intercept : boolean, default False
        If True and if X is sparse, the method also returns the intercept,
        and the solver is automatically changed to 'sag'. This is only a
        temporary fix for fitting the intercept with sparse data. For dense
        data, use sklearn.linear_model._preprocess_data before your regression.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17

    check_input : boolean, default True
        If False, the input arrays X and y will not be checked.

        .. versionadded:: 0.21

    Returns
    -------
    coef : array, shape = [n_features] or [n_targets, n_features]
        Weight vector(s).

    n_iter : int, optional
        The actual number of iteration performed by the solver.
        Only returned if `return_n_iter` is True.

    intercept : float or array, shape = [n_targets]
        The intercept of the model. Only returned if `return_intercept`
        is True and if X is a scipy sparse array.

    Notes
    -----
    This function won't compute the intercept.
