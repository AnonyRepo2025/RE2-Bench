"Input":

Predicted output(Deepseek-R1):

Reasining process (DeepSeek-R1):
```
Steps in `as_string`:
1. `items['replaces_str']` and `items['initial_str']` are initialized as empty strings.
2. `imports` is an empty set, and `operations` is an empty list. Since `self.migration.operations` is null (treated as empty), no operations are processed.
3. `dependencies` is empty, so `items['dependencies']` remains empty.
4. `imports` gets 'from django.db import migrations' added since no models import exists.
5. Sorted imports result in ['from django.db import migrations'].
6. `items['imports']` becomes "from django.db import migrations\n".
7. `items['migration_header']` is empty due to `include_header=false`.
8. The template is filled with:
   - `migration_header`: ""
   - `imports`: "from django.db import migrations\n"
   - `replaces_str`: ""
   - `initial_str`: ""
   - `dependencies`: "" (empty list)
   - `operations`: "" (empty list)

The resulting string is:

from django.db import migrations

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
    ]

    operations = [
    ]
```
Explanation:  
DeepSeek-R1 failed to apply the format-mapping API correctly, even though it accurately identified the variables to populate the template.

## Structural Complexity Oversight(ClassEval_EightPuzzle)

code:
```python
class EightPuzzle:

    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.initial_state = initial_state
        self.goal_state = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]]

    def find_blank(self, state):
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                if state[i][j] == 0:
                    return (i, j)

    def move(self, state, direction):
        i, j = self.find_blank(state)
        new_state = [row[:] for row in state]
        if direction == 'up':
            new_state[i][j], new_state[i - 1][j] = (new_state[i - 1][j], new_state[i][j])
        elif direction == 'down':
            new_state[i][j], new_state[i + 1][j] = (new_state[i + 1][j], new_state[i][j])
        elif direction == 'left':
            new_state[i][j], new_state[i][j - 1] = (new_state[i][j - 1], new_state[i][j])
        elif direction == 'right':
            new_state[i][j], new_state[i][j + 1] = (new_state[i][j + 1], new_state[i][j])
        return new_state

"ouput": [

```

Predicted ouput (DeepseekCoder-Inst-33b):
```
"ouput": [
          [1,6,2],
          [7,8,0],
          [4,5,3]
        ]
```

Reasoning Process:
```
1. The initial state is [[1, 2, 3], [0, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]] and the goal state is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 0]].
2. The state to be moved is [[1, 6, 2], [7, 8, 0], [4, 5, 3]] and the direction is "left".
3. The blank space is at (1, 0) in the initial state and at (1, 1) in the state to be moved.
4. The blank space in the initial state can move to the left, but not to the right, up or down.
5. The blank space in the state to be moved can move to the right, but not to the left, up or down.
6. Therefore, the output of `move` will be the same as the input state, because the blank space in the state to be moved can't move to the left.
```

Explanation:  
Due to the comlpexity in the `state`, the model could not correctly simulate the execution of `i, j = self.find_blank(state)`, which results in the incorrect output prediction.
